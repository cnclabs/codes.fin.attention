we experienced rapid growth in the sales of packaged handset protection products 
in addition  we introduced the xtremeesdtm device family that includes architectures optimized for the maximum protection of advanced system integrated circuits as well as for the highest speed data interfaces 
we also introduced our praetorian ii family of emi filters during fiscal in addition  we also made considerable progress on our major cost reduction initiatives which include outsourcing with lower cost subcontractors  migration from six inch to eight inch wafers for many of our products  migration of low capacitance esd products to the lower cost sinker process and continued improvement in our assembly and testing processes 
future outlook based on our analysis of future customer needs  backlog and our recent and anticipated design wins  we expect revenue in fiscal to grow for both our protection products and display controller devices 
we expect the demand to increase for both our mobile handset devices and low capacitance esd protection devices used in digital tvs  other digital consumer electronics and personal computers 
we continue to invest in new products and are committed to increasing our research and development efforts in order to provide our customers with continued improvements in functionality and features 
we plan to invest significantly in our display controller product family as well as our protection products

table of contents net sales fiscal versus net sales by market were as follows in millions year ended march  as of as of total total amount sales amount sales change change mobile handset digital consumer electronics and personal computers total net sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of million or from million of net sales in fiscal sales from products for the mobile handset market decreased by million or for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to two factors a lower sales to a major customer as a result of share shifts in the mobile handset market and competition as well as b price decreases of our products 
these declines were partially offset by increases in unit sales to other customers 
sales from products for the digital consumer electronics and personal computer market increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  up million or  which was primarily driven by increased sales of our low capacitance and hbled esd products 
in fiscal the total number of units sold decreased to million units from million units in fiscal the shipments of packaged handset protection devices increased to million units in fiscal from million units in fiscal fiscal versus net sales by market were as follows in millions year ended march  as of as of total total amount sales amount sales change change mobile handset digital consumer electronics and personal computers total net sales for fiscal were million  a decrease of million or from million of net sales in fiscal sales from products for the mobile handset market decreased by million or for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as a result of increased competition  lower demand from one of our major customers and price decreases of our products 
sales from products for the digital consumer electronics and personal computer market increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  up million or  which was primarily driven by increased sales of our low capacitance esd products 

table of contents in fiscal the number of units sold increased to million units from million units in fiscal however  there was a marked shift from csp to packaged parts in shipments of our products for the mobile handset market during fiscal sales of packaged parts for the mobile handset market increased to in from in sales by region net sales by geographic region were as follows in millions  based on where we ship our products rather than where the customers headquarters are located year ended march  of of of amount total amount total amount total united states korea china taiwan singapore others total net sales fiscal versus international sales decreased from of our net sales in fiscal to in fiscal in fiscal  revenue from the china region was approximately of our total sales as compared to a year ago  primarily as a result of lower demand from one of our major customers 
we expect that our international sales will continue to represent a majority of our sales in the foreseeable future 
fiscal versus international sales decreased from of our net sales in fiscal to in fiscal in fiscal  revenue from the china region was approximately of our total sales as compared to in fiscal  primarily as a result of lower demand from one of our major customers 

table of contents gross margin fiscal versus gross margin decreased by million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal due to the following reasons gross margin increase decrease compared to prior period in millions price change of products based on a constant mix for target markets volume  mix and other factors cost reductions of our products on a constant mix the gross margin decrease was primarily driven by decreases in prices and volume of our products as well as change in our product mix  partially offset by product cost reductions 
our asp declined based on a constant mix of products in fiscal as compared to a year ago 
in the future we expect our asp for similar products  based on a constant mix of products  to decline at the rate of to per year 
units sold in mobile handset market decreased by and units sold in digital consumer electronics and personal computer markets increased by during fiscal as compared to a year ago 
the cost reductions of our products were primarily due to outsourcing with lower cost subcontractors  migration of low capacitance esd products to the lower cost sinker process and continued improvement in our assembly and testing processes 
gross margin as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal as compared to in fiscal our long range gross margin target remains to 
however  our gross margin could fail to achieve this target range or could decline 
fiscal versus gross margin decreased by million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal due to the following reasons gross margin increase decrease compared to prior period in millions price change of products based on a constant mix for target markets cost reductions of our products on a constant mix volume  mix and other factors employee stock based compensation expense 
table of contents the gross margin decrease was driven by decrease in prices of our products for target markets and recognition of sfas r stock based compensation expense during fiscal  partially offset by the increase in the volume of products sold  cost reductions and similar other factors 
our asp declined based on a constant mix of products in fiscal as compared to fiscal the cost reductions of our products were primarily due to outsourcing with lower cost subcontractors and continued improvement in our assembly  testing and packaging processes 
in fiscal unit sales increased to approximately million units from approximately million units in fiscal we recognized employee stock based compensation expense in fiscal in accordance with sfas r beginning on april  as a result of sfas r  our cost of sales increased by approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal gross margin as a percentage of net sales was in both fiscal years and research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and other related costs for employees  prototypes  masks and other expenses for the development of new products  process technology and packages 
the changes in research and development expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal  and for fiscal compared to fiscal  were as follows fiscal fiscal compared to compared to expense increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year in thousands fiscal fiscal engineering supplies product related costs salaries and benefits  outside services and other costs employee stock based compensation expense fiscal versus research and development expenses decreased by million during fiscal as compared with fiscal  primarily due to the timing of our new product development projects in both our serial interface display controller product and protection devices 
this decline is considered temporary as serial interface display controller and protection devices development activity will ramp up during fiscal as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses were flat at in fiscal as compared to a year ago primarily due to decrease in our sales 
our long term target for research and development expenses is to of sales 
however  research and development expenses may exceed our target range and represent more than of sales as we expect to be the case in fiscal  due primarily to our increased planned spending on serial interface display controller products 

table of contents fiscal versus research and development expenses increased by million during fiscal as compared with fiscal  primarily due to the impact of employee stock based compensation expense and increase in our product design and development efforts  specifically for new display controller products in mobile handset market 
engineering supplies  prototypes and other product related research and development expenses increased as we hired additional engineers and incurred costs in order to increase our in house product development activities 
outside service expenses decreased in fiscal as compared with fiscal due to a decline in outsourced development costs for our serial interface display controller 
as a percentage of sales  research and development expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and other employee related costs  sales commissions  marketing expenses  legal  accounting  and information technology expenses 
the changes in selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal compared to fiscal  and for fiscal compared to fiscal  were as follows fiscal fiscal compared to compared to expense increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year in thousands fiscal fiscal outside services employee stock based compensation expense marketing samples  travel and other expenses commissions  salaries and benefits fiscal versus selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately million in fiscal as compared with a year ago  primarily due to a decrease in employee stock based compensation expense  professional services  and sales commissions as a result of reduced sales 
others factors included reduced spending for marketing samples and reduction in legal charges incurred during fiscal as compared with a year ago 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  primarily as a result of reduced sales 
our long term target for selling  general and administrative expenses is to of sales 
however  selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to exceed our target range and represent more than of sales until our sales increase substantially 

table of contents fiscal versus selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million in fiscal as compared with fiscal  primarily due to the impact of employee stock based compensation expense and increased professional services 
during fiscal  we used significantly more outside services than we typically use due to changes in management personnel in our finance group and one time projects related to our acquisition of arques 
salaries and benefits spending also increased significantly due to the increase in headcount in sales and marketing department from the arques acquisition 
total headcount in selling  general and administrative departments increased by approximately in fiscal as compared with fiscal travel expenses increased due to our increased marketing activities to sell our new products and expand our customer base 
on the other hand  product sample expenses decreased as we effectively implemented a cost savings program during fiscal as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from in fiscal to in fiscal ipr d ipr d expense in fiscal of million was related to the arques acquisition 
there was no ipr d expense recorded during each of the fiscal years and ipr d was expensed upon acquisition in fiscal because technological feasibility had not been established and no future alternative uses existed 
amortization of intangible assets at march  and  intangible assets consisted of developed and core technology and distributor relationships acquired as a part of the acquisition of arques technology  inc during fiscal developed and core technology and distributor relationships are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives of four years and two years  respectively 
we recorded amortization expense of  in fiscal and  in fiscal there were no such charges recorded in fiscal for further discussion of intangible assets  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
other income  net other income  net includes interest income  interest expense and other non operating income and expense in fiscal  and interest income remained at a consistent level of million in fiscal years and we expect future interest income to decrease significantly as a result of recent declines in interest rates 
interest income increased to approximately million in fiscal from million during fiscal the increase in interest income resulted from higher average interest rates in fiscal along with a higher average cash balance as a result of positive cash flow from operations and issuance of common stock under our employee stock option and employee stock purchase plans  partially offset by cash outflow for our investing activities 

table of contents interest expense was immaterial for fiscal years  and  respectively 
income taxes income tax expense is comprised of a current and deferred component 
the current tax provision in fiscal was million and primarily consists of cash payments made to taxing authorities and accruals under fin for potential additional tax in certain jurisdictions 
the deferred component of the fiscal tax provision was million and represents the net change to our tax accruals to reflect the expected future tax benefits of our net operating losses and other credits 
fiscal year ended march  total expense of million compares with an income tax provision of million recorded a year ago 
our income tax provision increased during fiscal year ended march  compared to a year ago  primarily as a result of our estimates in our ability to utilize loss carry forwards 
during the fiscal year ended march   we reduced million of the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  resulting in a net tax benefit of million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements  in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and the known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant 
we have not made any material change in the accounting methodology used to establish our estimates and assumptions during the past three fiscal years 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the accounting methodology used to establish our estimates or assumptions 
however  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are critical  either because they relate to financial line items that are key indicators of our financial performance such as revenue or because their application requires significant management judgment  are described in the following paragraphs 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or customer acceptance  where applicable  has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
revenue from product sales to end user customers  or to distributors that do not receive price concessions and do not have return rights  is recognized upon shipment and transfer of risk of loss  if we believe collection is reasonably assured and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and the customer s creditworthiness 
if we determine that collection of a receivable is not probable  we defer recognition of revenue until the collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
reserves for sales returns and allowances from end user customers are estimated based on historical experience and management judgment  and are provided for at the time of shipment 
the sufficiency of the reserves for sales return and allowances is assessed at the end of each reporting period 

table of contents revenue from sales of our standard products to distributors whose terms provide for price concessions or for product return rights is recognized when the distributor sells the product to an end customer 
for our end of life products  if we believe that collection is probable  we recognize revenue upon shipment to the distributor  because our contractual arrangements provide for no right of return or price concessions for those products 
when we sell products to distributors  we defer our gross selling price of the product shipped and its related cost and reflect such net amounts on our balance sheet as a current liability entitled deferred margin on shipments to distributors 
inventories forecasting customer demand is the factor in our inventory policy that involves significant judgments and estimates 
we estimate excess and obsolete inventory based on a comparison of the quantity and cost of inventory on hand to management s forecast of customer demand for the next twelve months 
in forecasting customer demand  we make estimates as to  among other things  the timing of sales  the mix of products sold to customers  the timing of design wins and related volume purchases by new and existing customers  and the timing of existing customers transition to new products 
we also use historical trends as a factor in forecasting customer demand  especially that from our distributors 
we review our excess and obsolete inventory on a quarterly basis considering the known facts 
once inventory is written down  it is valued as such until it is sold or otherwise disposed of 
to the extent that our forecast of customer demand materially differs from actual demand  our cost of sales and gross margin could be impacted 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset 
the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value 
we have accounted for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually and more frequently if there are indicators of impairment 
the amount of impairment loss is measured as the difference between the carrying value of the assets and their estimated fair value 
an impairment loss for an intangible asset is recognized if the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows from the use of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset 
significant judgment required to estimate the fair value of an intangible asset includes estimating future cash flows and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value 
any impairment loss recorded in the future could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our last annual impairment analysis of goodwill  which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  indicated that the estimated fair value exceeded its corresponding carrying amount 
our entity is deemed as a single reporting unit for our impairment analysis 
we computed fair value of our company to be equal to the market capitalization and compared it to the carrying value of the net assets of the company including goodwill and other intangible assets 
the market capitalization is based on the quoted closing market price of our stock as traded on nasdaq as of the date of our impairment analysis 
as such  we determined that no impairment exists 
the process for evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
should actual results differ from our estimates  revisions to the recorded amount of goodwill could be required 
we cannot predict the occurrence of future events that might lead to impairment nor the impact such events might have on these reported asset values 
we plan to examine goodwill for impairment at least annually 
stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we estimate the stock based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as an expense on a graded vesting schedule over the requisite service period of the award 
we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a black scholes model 
the determination of fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the use of a black scholes model requires the use of extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
our computation of expected volatility is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility 
our computation of expected life is based on a combination of historical exercise patterns and certain assumptions regarding the exercise life of unexercised options adjusted for job level and demographics 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the years ended march  and march  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on an average of historical forfeitures 
the expense that we recognize in future periods could differ significantly from the current period and or our forecasts due to adjustments in assumed forfeiture rates or change in our assumptions 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires significant judgments in making estimates for determining certain tax liabilities and recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  including the tax effects attributable to net operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expenses  as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions 

table of contents on a quarterly basis  we evaluate our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  including but not limited to our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years  and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates in the future  we will adjust the amount of the valuation allowance that may result in a decrease or increase in income tax expense in those periods 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two step process prescribed within the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we will evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
a change in recognition or measurement in the future may result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion 
litigation we are  on occasions  a party to lawsuits  claims  investigations  and proceedings  including commercial and employment matters  which are being addressed in the ordinary course of business 
we review the current status of any pending or threatened proceedings with our outside counsel on a regular basis and  considering all the known relevant facts and circumstances  we recognize any loss that we consider probable and estimable as of the balance sheet date 
for these purposes  we consider settlement offers we may make to be indicative of such a loss under certain circumstances 
as of march  and  we accrued  for our litigation related matters 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations through a combination of debt and equity financing and cash generated from operations 
as highlighted in the consolidated statements of cash flows  the company s liquidity and available capital resources are impacted by the following key components i cash and cash equivalents  ii operating activities  iii investing activities  and iv financing activities 
year ended march  in thousands cash provided by operating activities cash provided by used in investing activities cash provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents cash  cash equivalents and short term investments total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million as of march   compared to million at march   an increase of million or  primarily due to positive operating cash flow and net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock benefit plans  partially offset by cash payments for the purchase of manufacturing equipment and the final arques escrow payment 
our cash and cash equivalents increased million and short term investments decreased by million as of march  as compared to march  which primarily reflects our moving of assets from short term investments to cash and cash equivalents

investing activities during fiscal provided million of cash primarily due to movement of assets from short term investments to cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by the payment towards capital expenditure for purchase of fixed assets and the final arques escrow payment 
net sales and maturity of short term investments mainly includes commercial paper  corporate bonds and certificates of deposit 
our capital expenditure during fiscal includes payment of million towards the equipment purchased for spel  one of our sub contractors  in order to increase their production capacity in return for periodic repayments and lower product pricing 
we acquired arques for a total purchase consideration of million in fiscal  out of which the final escrow payable balance of approximately million was paid during fiscal investing activities during fiscal used million of cash primarily due to payment towards arques acquisition  net purchase of short term investments and capital expenditure for purchase of fixed assets

as of march   the liability for uncertain tax positions was approximately  in addition to the interest and tax penalties of  of which none is expected to be paid within one year 
we are unable to estimate when cash settlement with a taxing authority may occur 
we expect to fund all of these obligations with cash on hand or cash provided from operations 
we anticipate that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million as of march  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for the next twelve months 
should we desire to expand our level of operations more quickly  either through increased internal development or through the acquisition of product lines from other entities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing
