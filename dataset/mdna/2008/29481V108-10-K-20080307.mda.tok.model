overview we were founded in to provide cardiac safety services to evaluate the safety of new drugs 
we provide technology and services that enable the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device industries to collect  interpret and distribute cardiac safety and clinical data more efficiently 
we are a market leader in providing centralized electrocardiographic services cardiac safety services or expert ecg services and a leading provider of technology and services that streamline the clinical trials process by enabling our clients to evolve from traditional  paper based methods to electronic processing using our expert eclinical and expert epro products and services 
our solutions improve the accuracy  timeliness and efficiency of trial set up  data collection from sites worldwide  data interpretation  and new drug  biologic and device application submissions 
we offer cardiac safety services  which are utilized by pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  medical device companies  clinical trial sponsors and clinical research organizations cros during the conduct of clinical trials 
the cardiac safety services are performed during all phases of a clinical trial cycle and include the collection  interpretation and distribution of electrocardiographic ecg data and images 
the ecg provides an electronic map of the heart s rhythm and structure  and typically is performed in most clinical trials 
cardiac safety services permits assessments of the safety of therapies by documenting the occurrence of cardiac electrical change 
thorough qtc studies are comprehensive studies that typically are of large volume and of short duration  with ecgs performed over a two to six month period 
we also offer site support  which includes the rental and sale of cardiac safety equipment along with related supplies and freight 
additionally  we offer the licensing and  at the client s option  hosting of our proprietary expert eclinical software products and the provision of maintenance and consulting services in support of our proprietary expert eclinical software products 
we offer electronic patient reported outcomes epro services along with proprietary clinical assessments 
our license revenues consist of license fees for perpetual license sales and monthly and annual term license sales 
our services revenues consist of cardiac safety services and consulting  technology consulting and training services and software maintenance services 
our site support revenue consists of cardiac safety equipment rentals and sales along with related supplies and freight 
we enter into contracts to sell our products and services and  while the majority of our sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain multiple elements or non standard terms and conditions 
as a result  significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and  if so  how the contract value should be allocated among the deliverable elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known  uncertainties regarding client 
table of contents acceptance are resolved and there are no client negotiated refund or return rights affecting the revenue recognized for delivered elements 
cost of licenses consists primarily of application service provider asp fees for those clients that choose hosting  the cost of producing compact disks and related documentation and royalties paid to third parties in connection with their contributions to our product development 
cost of services includes the cost of cardiac safety services and the cost of technology consulting  training and maintenance services 
cost of cardiac safety services consists primarily of direct costs related to our centralized cardiac safety services and includes wages  depreciation  amortization  fees paid to outside consultants and other direct operating costs 
cost of technology consulting  training and maintenance services consists primarily of wages  fees paid to consultants and other direct operating costs related to our consulting and client support functions 
cost of site support consists primarily of wages  cardiac safety equipment rent and depreciation  related supplies  cost of equipment sold  shipping expenses and other direct operating costs 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of wages and commissions paid to sales personnel  travel expenses and advertising and promotional expenditures 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and direct costs for our finance  administrative  corporate information technology  legal and executive management functions  in addition to professional service fees and corporate insurance 
research and development expenses consist primarily of wages paid to our product development staff  costs paid to outside consultants and direct costs associated with the development of our technology products 
we conduct our operations through offices in the united states us and the united kingdom uk 
our international net revenues represented approximately  and of total net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the majority of our revenues are allocated among our geographic segments based upon the profit split transfer pricing methodology  and revenues are generally allocated to the geographic segment where the work is performed 
the international net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues reflect the application of the change in transfer pricing methodology  which we implemented in the third quarter of  as if the changes were in effect as of january  results of operations executive overview was a year of stabilization and return to growth for ert 
we witnessed increased cost pressures on pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as an increasingly competitive environment 
we responded to these challenges by several proactive enhancements to our organization that will serve as a solid foundation for future growth 
at the beginning of the year we released a new version of our key workflow management system expert which significantly enhanced our productivity and ability to deliver high quality work 
we also enhanced our business by undertaking an efficiency program in february to rationalize some elements of our cost structure  specifically in the core cardiac safety operations and in selling  general and administrative areas 
after approximately two years of adapting to the ich e guidance from governmental regulators  the industry began to incorporate the regulatory guidance into its drug development and budgetary processes resulting in an increased use of ecgs in some routine trials and the conducting of thorough ecg trials for most new drugs 
we had an excellent year in cardiac safety operations 
we set records for the number of ecg transactions processed  the amount of new sales bookings recorded and quarterly revenue levels  achieved in the fourth quarter 
we completed two transactions during the year 
on november   we acquired covance cardiac safety services  inc ccss  the covance inc ecg core lab  for million plus additional cash payments of up to approximately million  based upon the potential realization of revenue from the backlog transferred and from new contracts secured through covance s marketing activities 
during  covance earned million of this contingent amount  which we paid in january the final proceeds to covance are further subject to certain post closing working capital adjustments 
the acquisition included a marketing agreement under which covance is obligated to use us as its provider of centralized cardiac safety services  and to offer these services to covance s clients  on an exclusive basis  for a year period  subject to certain exceptions 
the agreement does not restrict our continuing collaboration with our other key cro  phase i units  academic research centers and other strategic partners 
we plan to fully integrate the operations of ccss into our existing operations 
we will do so by merging 
table of contents ccss s reno  nevada based operations into our existing operations in philadelphia  pennsylvania or peterborough  united kingdom 
in so doing  we will close the operations in reno in late in june  we licensed the key assets of healthcare technology systems hts  including its interactive voice response system and clinical assessments  some of which are proprietary 
this agreement launched our epro electronic patient reported outcomes line of business that we believe  over time  will turn into an attractive source of revenue growth for the company 
as of december   we paid hts million for the license and a million advanced payment against future royalties 
we will pay royalties to hts based on the level of revenues we receive from the assessments and the ivr system 
an additional million of royalty payments are guaranteed  and will be made in two equal payments in november and may any royalties earned by hts will be applied against these payments 
after these two payments are made  all future payments we make to hts will be royalty payments based solely on revenues we receive from expert epro sales 
in addition to the cardiac safety area  we have invested in our eclinical suite of software  both in technology and sales  as well as in our emerging epro line of business 
across all of our product lines  we continued our excellent track record of performance  customer service  quality and on time on budget delivery 
our net revenues for were million as compared to million for  which was the result of growth in our service revenues which are predominately cardiac safety related 
gross margins for were million as compared to million for the improvement in gross margins was due to the improvement in the operating leverage associated with the services element of our business

the decrease in average revenue per transaction was largely due to the impact of increased activity in semi automated processing  which generally includes lower fees per transaction than other studies  as well as competitive pricing pressure 
this decrease in average revenue per transaction primarily occurred in the first two quarters of the average revenue per transaction rose slightly in the third and fourth quarters of additionally  cardiac safety service revenue in the year ended december  included million of cardiac safety consulting services revenue  which was a new revenue source to ert beginning in there was also a million increase in project management fees and a million increase in miscellaneous revenue  commensurate with the increase in ecg transaction revenue 
the acquisition of ccss added approximately million in revenue in  which effectively offset the impact of the million of revenue we recognized in upon the termination of a digital ecg franchise at the end of august for which there was no corresponding revenue recognized in the decrease in technology consulting and training revenues was primarily related to a decrease in consulting revenue from expert eclinical clients related to protocol set up work 
software maintenance revenues decreased due to the cancellation and non renewals of maintenance agreements and a reduction in the number of users 
these declines were partially offset by maintenance on several software licenses sold during and our current sales focus is on monthly and annual term license sales rather than perpetual license sales  which will lead to the erosion of maintenance revenue over time 
monthly and annual term license sales do not generate maintenance revenue as the license fee includes product upgrades and customer support 
site support revenues decreased primarily due to a million decrease in the sale of cardiac safety equipment for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  while average monthly equipment rental revenue per unit has fallen by over from to  an increase in units rented more than compensated for the revenue impact 
additionally offsetting this decrease was an increase in freight revenues of million and supplies revenue of million  both of which were related to the additional units rented 
the acquisition of ccss added approximately million in revenue in the increase in the cost of cardiac safety services was primarily due to a million increase in depreciation expense related to our expert which was placed into production in january  million in consulting costs related to cardiac safety consulting revenue discussed above  million increase in bonus expense as certain bonus targets were met in while there was no bonus in  million increase in labor  and million 
table of contents increase in software license and maintenance 
additionally  there were million in costs relating to the ccss operation in  primarily related to labor costs 
partially offsetting the increase were reductions of million each in telecommunications  depreciation expense excluding expert  stock option compensation expense  pass through costs and allocated expenses 
the decrease in the cost of cardiac safety services as a percentage of cardiac safety service revenues reflects the fact that some of the costs do not necessarily change in direct relation with changes in revenue 
the decrease in the cost of technology consulting and training revenues was the result of a number of small decreases in expenses such as consultants and travel expenses

the decrease in the cost of software maintenance revenues  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of software maintenance revenues  was the result of lower labor costs due to reduced headcount 
the decrease in the cost of site support was primarily due to a million decrease in the cost of equipment sales commensurate with the decrease in revenue from equipment sales 
partially offsetting this decrease was a million increase in freight and million increase in supplies due to an increase in the number of units of equipment utilized by our clients 
an increase in depreciation expense of million was largely offset by a reduction in equipment rental expense 
the shift of expense between these categories resulted from our agreement to purchase our leased cardiac safety equipment 
the increase in the cost of site support as a percentage of site support revenues reflects the fact that some of the costs do not necessarily change in direct relation with changes in revenue 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net revenues  was due primarily to million of costs associated with management changes in the second quarter of and million of costs in associated with the settlement of a contract dispute  for which there were no corresponding expenses in additionally  there were decreases of million in stock option compensation expense  million in professional fees related to project and legal matters  million in charitable contributions made in and not repeated in and million each in depreciation and consulting costs 
partially offsetting the decrease was million in severance related costs for employees terminated in february  an increase of million each in bonus expense and non income taxes and million in software license and maintenance expense 
additionally  we accrued million for retention bonuses for employees of ccss to remain until their termination date 
the increase in research and development expenses  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net revenues  was primarily due to a million reduction in the capitalization of salaries for internal use software projects and a million increase in bonus expense 
partially offsetting the increase was a million decrease in expense for third party consultants and a million decrease in software license and maintenance expense 
smaller decreases occurred in expenses such as depreciation and labor 
other income  net  consisted primarily of interest income realized from our cash  cash equivalents and investments  interest expense related to capital lease obligations and foreign exchange losses

these decreases were partially offset by the recognition of million of deferred revenues that remained upon the termination of a digital ecg franchise agreement at the end of august the increase in technology consulting and training revenues was primarily related to million of professional services performed in connection with license sales as well as a million increase in consulting revenue from expert eclinical clients related to protocol set up work 
many of the license sales in required limited consulting services due to the nature of the licenses sold 
software maintenance revenues decreased due to the cancellation of maintenance agreements and the settlement of a contract dispute which resulted in our providing software maintenance to one customer at no charge for a four year period beginning august   which resulted in a decrease in software maintenance revenue of million in as compared to these declines were partially offset by maintenance on several new software licenses sold during and site support revenue increased primarily due to a million increase in the sale of cardiac safety equipment in as compared to our clients use cardiac safety equipment to perform cardiac safety procedures 
the increase was also due to a million increase in the rental of cardiac safety equipment in as compared to  as well as an increase in freight revenue due to additional shipments 
the decrease in cost of licenses was primarily due to a reduction in third party asp hosting fees and software license and maintenance costs 
the increase in cost of licenses as a percentage of license revenues was due to the decrease in perpetual license revenues which have very little incremental cost of sales  such that revenue reductions lead to minimal cost savings 
the increase in the cost of cardiac safety services  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of cardiac safety revenues  was primarily due to unanticipated charges for services previously provided of million  million of stock option compensation expense in related to the adoption of sfas no

additional increases occurred for utilities  
table of contents costs associated with an offsite computer hosting facility and increased software license and maintenance costs

the increase in the cost of technology consulting and training services was primarily due to higher third party consulting costs required to accommodate the increased workload associated with the increase in revenue 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in bonuses as no bonus expense was recognized in while bonus expense was recognized under a six month bonus plan in the second half of the decrease in the cost of technology consulting and training services as a percentage of technology consulting and training service revenues was due to the fact that some of the costs do not necessarily increase or decrease in direct relation with changes in revenue 
the increase in the cost of site support  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of site support revenues  was due primarily to an increase in the cost of sales of equipment of million and million of depreciation costs associated with cardiac safety rental equipment as well as increased freight costs of million 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses  both in absolute terms and as a percentage of total net revenues  was primarily due to million of stock option compensation expense recognized in related to the adoption of sfas no

the primary cause of the increase in the effective tax rate was stock option compensation expense in  which is not fully deductible for tax purposes 
partially offsetting this increase to the effective tax rate was an increase in tax free interest income in additionally  the effective tax rate for the year ended december  included a net income tax benefit of approximately million related to the recovery of prior year state taxes due to a change in our transfer pricing methodology 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million invested in short term investments 
we generally place our investments in municipal securities  bonds of government sponsored agencies  certificates of deposit with fixed rates and maturities of less than one year  and ap rated commercial bonds and paper 
for the year ended december   our operations provided cash of million compared to million during the year ended december  the change was primarily the result of an increase of million in net income and a million increase in depreciation expense including million for cardiac 
table of contents safety rental equipment and million related to our expert which was placed into production in january the increase in cardiac safety rental equipment depreciation was largely due to our agreement in to purchase our leased cardiac safety equipment 
other factors contributing to the increase in cash provided by operations include a million increase in deferred revenue in as compared to a million decrease in and a million increase in net income taxes payable in as compared to a million increase in net prepaid income taxes in due to the size and timing of estimated payments 
a large digital ecg franchise customer contract ended in  which resulted in the decrease in deferred revenues in as the franchise advanced payments were recognized as revenue as services were performed 
for the year ended december   our investing activities used cash of million compared to million during the year ended december  in  we used million to acquire ccss 
the impact of this on cash used by investing activities was largely offset by the net sales of investments of million that were used to help fund the acquisition 
by comparison  net purchases of investments used million of cash for the year ended december  during the years ended december  and  we purchased million and million  respectively  of property and equipment 
included in property and equipment is internal use software associated with the development of a data and communications management services software product expert used in connection with our centralized core cardiac safety ecg services 
we capitalize certain internal use software costs in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for costs of computer software for internal use 
the amortization is charged to the cost of cardiac safety services beginning at the time the software is ready for its intended use 
the initial development costs of expert were for the basic functionality required for this product 
additional development costs of expert were incurred to develop new functionalities and enhancements 
we began capitalizing costs associated with an upgrade to expert expert beginning in the fourth quarter of in april  we began developing enhancements to expert which were necessary while expert was being developed 
at the beginning of april  we extended the remaining life of the existing expert product to co exist with expert and extended the depreciation period through august this resulted in a decrease in monthly amortization expense of  beginning in april expert was placed into production in january in the first quarter of  we began development of a data warehouse that enables centralized capture of cardiac safety data and the ability to integrate with the food and drug administration s ecg data warehouse 
the data warehouse was placed into production in january in the second quarter of  we announced that we were launching a new line of business focused on electronic patient reported outcomes expert epro and entered into a long term strategic relationship with healthcare technology systems  inc hts  a leading authority in the research  development and validation of computer administered clinical rating instruments 
the strategic relationship includes the exclusive licensing subject to one pre existing license agreement of ivr clinical assessments offered by hts along with hts s ivr system 
we placed the system into production in december as of december   we paid hts million for the license and a million advanced payment against future royalties 
we will pay royalties to hts based on the level of revenues we receive from the assessments and the ivr system 
an additional million of royalty payments are guaranteed  and will be made in two equal payments in november and may any royalties earned by hts will be applied against these payments 
after these two payments are made  all future payments we make to hts will be royalty payments based solely on revenues we receive from expert epro sales

partially offsetting the reduction in cash provided by financing activities was the purchase of million of common stock under our stock buy back program in the first quarter of there was no purchase under the stock buy back program in the year ended december  we allowed our line of credit arrangement with wachovia bank  national association totaling million  to lapse at june  we expect to reinstate this line of credit at similar terms in the first quarter of at the time the line of credit lapsed  we had not borrowed any amounts under the line of credit 
as of december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million 
we have commitments to purchase approximately million of private label cardiac safety equipment from a manufacturer with million committed over a twelve month period ending in november and million committed over a twelve month period ending in december this cardiac safety equipment is expected to be purchased in the normal course of business and thus does not represent a significant commitment above our expected purchases of ecg equipment during that period 
as of december   approximately million of equipment was purchased under the commitments  accordingly  the balance of such commitments as of december  was million 
as of december   million of our short term investments were invested in variable rate demand notes or vrdn  and million in auction rate securities or ars  issued by municipalities and government sponsored agencies 
through february   we had reduced our total investments in ars to million  principally by investing in other short term investments as individual ars reset periods came due and the securities were once again subject to the auction process 
the million we have invested in ars and million in vrdn at february  all were rated aaa by a major credit rating agency  with the exception of one  ars instrument which is rated a 
our auction rate securities are guaranteed by commercial insurance carriers 
through february   auctions for million of these ars were not successful  resulting in our continuing to hold these securities and the issuers paying interest at the maximum contractual rate 
based on current market conditions  it is likely that auctions related to more of the ars will be unsuccessful in the near term 
unsuccessful auctions will result in our holding ars beyond their next scheduled auction reset dates and limiting the short term liquidity of these investments 
while these failures in the auction process have affected our ability to access these funds in the near term  we do not believe that the underlying securities or collateral have been affected 
we believe that the higher reset interest rates on failed auctions provide sufficient incentive for the security issuers to address 
table of contents this lack of liquidity 
if the credit rating of the security issuers deteriorates  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an impairment charge and or reclassify these investments from short term to long term investments 
we expect that existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs for at least the next year 
however  there may be acquisition and other growth opportunities that require additional external financing and we may from time to time seek to obtain additional funds from the public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
there can be no assurance that any such acquisitions will occur or that such financings will be available or available on terms acceptable to us 
our board of directors authorized a stock buy back program of million shares  of which million shares remain to be purchased as of december  the stock buy back authorization allows us  but does not require us  to purchase the authorized shares 
the purchase of the remaining shares authorized could require us to use a significant portion of our cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments and could also require us to seek additional external financing 
during the year ended december   we purchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
no shares were purchased during the year ended december  on november   we completed the acquisition of ccss 
under the terms of our agreement to purchase ccss  the total initial purchase consideration was million 
we have additionally incurred approximately million in transaction costs 
we may also pay contingent consideration of up to approximately million based upon our potential realization of revenue from the backlog transferred and from new contracts secured through covance s marketing activities 
the period for contingent payments runs through as of december   we recorded an accrual and increased goodwill by million for contingent payments which we paid in february under the terms of the marketing agreement  covance agreed to exclusively use us as its provider of centralized cardiac safety services for a ten year period  subject to certain exceptions 
we plan to fully integrate the operations of ccss into our existing operations 
we will do so by merging ccss s reno  nevada based operations into our existing operations in philadelphia  pennsylvania or peterborough  united kingdom 
in so doing  we will close the operations in reno in late costs identified at the date of the acquisition as part of this closing were estimated to be million for severance and million for lease costs 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination  these amounts have been recognized as a liability as of the date of the acquisition and included in the cost of the acquisition 
other costs such as stay pay incentive arrangements and other related period costs associated with the closing of the reno location will be expensed in the period when such costs are incurred 
the stay pay incentive arrangements costs  which we estimate will be million  will be recognized as expense over the required service period of the employee 
the following table presents contractual obligations information as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations total includes the estimated lease costs for the reno location for the period where it will not be used for operations 
the long term portion of other liabilities is comprised of the present value of estimated lease costs for the reno location for the period where it will not be used for operations and deferred rent for the reno location 
the gross amount of the payments associated with these liabilities are included in operating leases in the contractual obligations table above 

table of contents inflation we believe the effects of inflation and changing prices generally do not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb ratified the eitf consensus on eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
the scope of eitf includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer  and allows for the adoption of an accounting policy of presenting taxes either on a gross basis within revenue or on a net basis 
we collect various taxes which have been and continue to be accounted for on a net basis 
we adopted eitf on january   the required effective date 
the adoption of eitf did not have an effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we adopted fin effective january  we did not recognize any adjustment in the liability for unrecognized income tax benefits as a result of the implementation of fin in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which establishes a framework for reporting fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
becomes effective beginning with our first quarter fiscal period 
in january  fasb issued fasb staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
which delays the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after november  for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the delay is intended to allow additional time for fasb to consider the effect of various implementation issues that have arisen  or that may arise  from the application of sfas no 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of sfas no 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
allows companies to elect to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this standard is not expected to have any impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december of  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at fair value as of the acquisition date 
sfas r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we are required to adopt sfas no 
r in the first quarter of and will be applied prospectively 
the impact of adopting sfas r will depend on the nature and terms of future acquisitions 
critical accounting policies in december and december  the sec issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  the following are our critical accounting policies 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenues primarily from three sources license fees  services and site support 
our license revenues consist of license fees for perpetual license sales and monthly and annual term license sales 
our services revenues consist of cardiac safety services  technology consulting and training services and software maintenance services 
our site support revenues consist of cardiac safety equipment rentals and sales along with related supplies and freight 
we recognize software revenues in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
accordingly  we recognize up front license fee revenues under the residual method when a formal agreement exists  delivery of the software and related documentation has occurred  collectability is probable and the license fee is fixed or determinable 
we recognize monthly and annual term license fee revenues over the term of the arrangement 
hosting service fees are recognized evenly over the term of the service 
cardiac safety services revenues consist of services that we provide on a fee for services basis and are recognized as the services are performed 
site support revenues are recognized at the time of sale or over the rental period 
we recognize revenues from software maintenance contracts on a straight line basis over the term of the maintenance contract  which is typically twelve months 
we provide consulting and training services on a time and materials basis and recognize revenues as we perform the services 
at the time of the transaction  management assesses whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
the assessment of whether the fee is fixed or determinable is based upon the payment terms of the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms or upon implementation or client acceptance  the fee is accounted for as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  revenue is recognized as the fees become due or after implementation or client acceptance has occurred 
collectability is assessed based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the client and the creditworthiness of the client 
if it is determined that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  the fee is deferred and revenue is recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
under a typical contract for cardiac safety services  clients pay us a portion of our fee for these services upon contract execution as an upfront deposit  some of which is typically nonrefundable upon contract termination 
revenues are then recognized under cardiac safety service contracts as the services are performed 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of each element is known  the revenue is allocated to each component based on the relative fair values of each element 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables where the fair value of one or more delivered elements is not known  revenue is allocated to each component of the arrangement using the residual method provided that the fair value of all undelivered elements is known 
fair values for undelivered elements are based primarily upon stated renewal rates for future products or services 
business combinations in november  we completed the acquisition of ccss  and we may pursue additional acquisitions in the future 
we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets we acquired and liabilities we assumed based on their estimated fair values 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  backlog  customer relationships  proprietary technology and discount rates 
our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets we acquired and liabilities we assumed 

table of contents for a discussion of how we allocated the purchase price of ccss  see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
goodwill as a result of the ccss acquisition  we carry a significant amount of goodwill 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test at least annually 
we perform the impairment test annually as of december or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill might be impaired 
no provisions for goodwill impairment were recorded during  or if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable  we will base the measurement of any impairment on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves management having to estimate our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the differing treatment of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
management must then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent management establishes or increases a valuation allowance in a period  the consolidated statement of operations will reflect additional income tax expense 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred taxes and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance of million related to the uncertain realization of certain deferred tax assets 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
depreciation and amortization of long lived assets we compute depreciation on our property  plant and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which generally range from two to five years 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the remaining lease term 
system development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over four or five years or  in the case of enhancements which have no stand alone use  the remaining life of the initial project 
we compute amortization on our intangible assets  other than goodwill  over their estimated useful lives  which generally range from one to ten years 
amortization of backlog from the ccss acquisition is recognized on an accelerated basis while other intangibles are amortized using the straight line method 
changes in the estimated useful lives of long lived assets could have a material effect on our results of operations 
stock based compensation we follow the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of options using the black scholes option pricing model with assumptions based primarily on historical data 
the assumptions used in the black scholes option pricing model require estimates of the expected term the stock based awards are held until exercised  the estimated volatility of our stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
changes in our assumptions may impact the expenses related to our stock options 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which begin on page f of this form k  for a description of our accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary financial market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we generally place our investments in money market funds  municipal securities  bonds of government sponsored agencies  certificates of deposit with fixed rates with maturities of less than one year  and ap rated commercial bonds and paper 
we actively manage our portfolio of cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  but in order to ensure liquidity  we will only invest in instruments with high credit quality where a secondary market exists 
we have not held and do not hold any derivatives related to our interest rate exposure 
due to the average maturity and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
management estimates that had the average yield of our investments decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately million 
this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of and reduced the yield of each investment by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income of future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments 
see liquidity and capital resources as part of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
foreign currency risk we operate on a global basis from locations in the united states and the united kingdom 
all international net revenues and expenses are billed or incurred in either us dollars or pounds sterling 
as such  we face exposure to adverse movements in the exchange rate of the pound sterling 
as the currency rate changes  translation of the statement of operations of our uk subsidiary from the local currency to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
we do not currently hedge translation risks 
management estimates that a change in the exchange rate of the pound sterling would have impacted the reported consolidated operating income for the year ended december  by less than million
