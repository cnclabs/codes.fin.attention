the merger was approved by the stockholders of both the company and private reis on may  and was completed later that day 
the previously announced plan of the company was terminated as a result of the merger and the company returned to the going concern basis of accounting from the liquidation basis of accounting 
for accounting purposes  the merger was deemed to have occurred at the close of business on may  and the statements of operations include the operations of reis services  effective june  the merger agreement provided for half of the aggregate consideration to be paid in company stock and the remaining half to be paid in cash to private reis stockholders  except wellsford capital  the company s subsidiary which owned a converted preferred interest and which received only company stock 
the company issued  shares of common stock to private reis stockholders  other than wellsford capital  used  of the cash consideration which was funded by a  bank loan facility the bank loan  the commitment for which was obtained by private reis in october and was drawn upon immediately prior to the merger  and approximately  provided by the company 
the per share value of the company s common stock  for purposes of the exchange of stock interests in the merger  had been previously established at per common share 
the value of the company s stock for purposes of recording the acquisition was based upon the average closing price of the company s stock for a short period near the date that the merger agreement was executed of per common share  as provided for under relevant accounting literature

all other assets were presented at estimated net realizable value on an undiscounted basis 
the amount also included reserves for future estimated general and administrative expenses and other costs and for cash payments on outstanding stock options during the liquidation 
the primary reasons for the decline in net assets in liquidation of approximately  from december  to may  are the increase in the reserve for stock options due to the increase in the price of the company s stock from to per share  representing approximately  of the decrease  and the decline in the value of real estate assets under development

table of contents in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
this interpretation  among other things  creates a two step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions 
recognition step one occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement step two determines the amount of benefit that more likely than not will be realized upon settlement 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
fin specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for derecognition of tax positions  and it has expanded disclosure requirements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   in which the impact of adoption should be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
there was no financial statement impact upon the adoption of fin  effective january  liquidation basis of accounting with the approval of the plan by the stockholders  the company adopted the liquidation basis of accounting effective as of the close of business on november  the liquidation basis of accounting was used through may  when the merger was completed and at the same time the plan was terminated

the statement of net assets in liquidation and a statement of changes in net assets in liquidation are the principal financial statements presented under the liquidation basis of accounting 
the valuation of assets at their net realizable value and liabilities at their anticipated settlement amounts represented estimates  based on present facts and circumstances  of the net realizable values of assets and the costs associated with carrying out the plan and dissolution based on the assumptions set forth below 
the actual values and costs associated with carrying out the plan were expected to differ from the amounts shown herein because of the inherent uncertainty and would be greater than or less than the amounts recorded

in addition  the estimate of net assets in liquidation per share  except for projects under development  did not incorporate a present value discount 
under the liquidation basis of accounting  sales revenue and cost of sales are not separately reported within the statements of changes in net assets as the company has already reported the net realizable value of each development project at the applicable balance sheet dates

reconciliation of net income to ebitda ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
although ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  senior management uses ebitda to measure operational and management performance 
management believes that ebitda is an appropriate metric that may be used by investors as a supplemental financial measure to be considered in addition to the reported gaap basis financial information to assist investors in evaluating and understanding the company s business from year to year or period to period  as applicable 
further  ebitda provides the reader with the ability to understand our operational performance while isolating non cash charges  such as depreciation and amortization expenses and stock based compensation  as well as other non operating items  such as interest income  interest expense and income taxes 
management also believes that disclosing ebitda will provide better comparability to other companies in reis services s type of business 
however  investors should not consider this measure in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  or any other measure for determining operating performance that is calculated in accordance with gaap 
in addition  because ebitda is not calculated in accordance with gaap  it may not necessarily be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies

the continuing increases in energy costs and construction materials such as concrete  lumber and sheetrock could adversely impact our home building business 
as costs increase  our products become more expensive to build and 
table of contents profit margins could deteriorate 
in order to maintain profit margin levels  we may need to increase sale prices of our condominiums and homes if such increases can be sustained in the current market conditions 
a continuing rise in energy costs  the uncertainty as to the united states economy in general and more specific to the local economies where our residential activities are located  as well as increasing illiquidity in the residential mortgage market may negatively impact our marketing efforts and the ability for buyers to afford and or finance the purchase of one of our homes or lots  which could result in the inability to meet targeted sales prices or cause us to offer sale price reductions 
the company has limited its exposure from the effects of increasing interest on its construction loans and a portion of the bank loan by purchasing interest caps

reis services the company monitors commercial real estate industry and market trends to determine their potential impact on its products and product development initiatives 
to date  neither the recent volatility in the us housing and residential mortgage markets or the credit markets in general  nor the slowdown in commercial real estate market activity has materially affected the marketability of the company s products or the renewal rates of its subscription services 
during historical periods of economic and commercial real estate market volatility  private reis experienced stable demand for current information on changing market conditions and an increase in demand for its portfolio products as mortgage lenders place greater emphasis on assessing portfolio risk
