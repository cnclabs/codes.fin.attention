the corresponding reporting period ended february  contained weeks 
for comparability purposes  where noted  some of the information discussed below is based upon comparison of the weeks ended february  and january  to the corresponding period ended january  trends and uncertainties we have identified the following key uncertainties whose fluctuations may have a material effect on our operating results 
cash flow cash from operating activities is a primary source of liquidity that is adversely affected when the industry faces market driven challenges and new and existing competitors seek areas of growth to expand their businesses 
pricing if our customers do not purchase our merchandise offerings in sufficient quantities  we respond by taking markdowns 
if we have to reduce our prices  the cost of goods sold on our income statement will correspondingly rise  thus reducing our income 
success of brand the success of our exclusive brand merchandise is dependent upon customer fashion preferences 
store growth our growth is dependent on a number of factors which could prevent the opening of new stores  such as identifying suitable markets and locations 
sourcing store merchandise is dependent upon adequate and stable availability of materials and production facilities from which the company sources its merchandise

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
since future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty  actual results will differ from those estimates 
the company evaluates its estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and predicates those estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results will differ from these under different assumptions or conditions 
management of the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents 
index to financial statements merchandise inventory 
approximately of the inventories are valued at lower of cost or market using the retail last in  first out lifo inventory method 
under the retail inventory method rim  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
additionally  it is recognized that the use of rim will result in valuing inventories at the lower of cost or market if markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments including  among others  merchandise markon  markups  and markdowns  which significantly impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as the resulting gross margins 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation which results in a carrying value at the lower of cost or market 
the remaining of the inventories are valued at lower of cost or market using the specific identified cost method 
a change in markdowns would have impacted net income by approximately million for the year ended february  revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue upon the sale of merchandise to its customers  net of anticipated returns 
the provision for sales returns is based on historical evidence of our return rate 
we recorded an allowance for sales returns of million and million as of february  and february   respectively 
adjustments to earnings resulting from revisions to estimates on our sales return provision have been insignificant for the years ended february   february  and january  prior to the sale of its credit card business to ge  finance charge revenue earned on customer accounts serviced by the company under its proprietary credit card proprietary card program was recognized in the period in which it was earned 
beginning november   the company s share of income earned under the long term marketing and servicing alliance is included as a component of service charges and other income 
the company received income of approximately million  million and million from ge in  and  respectively 
further pursuant to this agreement  the company has no continuing involvement other than to honor the proprietary cards in its stores 
although not obligated to a specific level of marketing commitment  the company participates in the marketing of the proprietary cards and accepts payments on the proprietary cards in its stores as a convenience to customers who prefer to pay in person rather than by mailing their payments to ge 
merchandise vendor allowances 
the company receives concessions from its merchandise vendors through a variety of programs and arrangements  including co operative advertising  payroll reimbursements and margin maintenance programs 
cooperative advertising allowances are reported as a reduction of advertising expense in the period in which the advertising occurred 
if vendor advertising allowances were substantially reduced or eliminated  the company would likely consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of our product advertising  which could increase or decrease our expenditures 
similarly  we are not able to assess the impact of vendor advertising allowances on creating additional revenues  as such allowances do not directly generate revenue for our stores 
payroll reimbursements are reported as a reduction of payroll expense in the period in which the reimbursement occurred 
all other merchandise vendor allowances are recognized as a reduction of cost purchases when received 
accordingly  a reduction or increase in vendor concessions has an inverse impact on cost of sales and or selling and administrative expenses 
the amounts recognized as a reduction in cost of sales have not varied significantly over the past three fiscal years 
insurance accruals 
the company s consolidated balance sheets include liabilities with respect to self insured workers compensation with a self insured retention of million per claim and general liability with a self insured retention of million per claim claims 
the company estimates the required liability of such claims  utilizing an actuarial method  based upon various assumptions  which include  but are not limited to  our historical loss experience  projected loss development factors  actual payroll and other data 
the required liability is also

index to financial statements subject to adjustment in the future based upon the changes in claims experience  including changes in the number of incidents frequency and changes in the ultimate cost per incident severity 
as of february  and february   insurance accruals of million and million  respectively  were recorded in trade accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities 
adjustments resulting from changes in historical loss trends have reduced expenses during the years ended february  and february   partially due to new company programs that have helped decrease both the number and cost of claims 
further  we do not anticipate any significant change in loss trends  settlements or other costs that would cause a significant change in our earnings 
a change in our self insurance reserve would have affected net earnings by million for the fiscal year ended february  finite lived assets 
the company s judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market and operational performance 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  primarily fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or store closings 
the company performs an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related finite lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including future sales growth and profit margins are included in this analysis 
to the extent these future projections or the company s strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
goodwill 
the company evaluates goodwill annually as of the last day of the fourth quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from its estimated future cash flows 
to the extent these future projections or our strategies change  the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from the current estimates 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using projected discounted cash flows and are based on our best estimate of future revenue and operating costs and general market conditions 
these estimates are subject to review and approval by senior management 
this approach uses significant assumptions  including projected future cash flows  the discount rate reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows and a terminal growth rate 
income taxes 
temporary differences arising from differing treatment of income and expense items for tax and financial reporting purposes result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are recorded on the balance sheet 
these balances  as well as income tax expense  are determined through management s estimations  interpretation of tax law for multiple jurisdictions and tax planning 
if the company s actual results differ from estimated results due to changes in tax laws  new store locations or tax planning  the company s effective tax rate and tax balances could be affected 
as such these estimates may require adjustment in the future as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted the new requirement as of february  with the cumulative effects recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of million

the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of the date of adoption was million  of which million would  if recognized  affect the effective tax rate 
the total amount of accrued interest and penalty as of the date of adoption was million 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of february  was million  of which million would  if recognized  affect the effective tax rate

index to financial statements the company is currently being examined by the internal revenue service for the fiscal tax years through the company is also under examination by various state and local taxing jurisdictions for various fiscal years 
the tax years that remain subject to examination for major tax jurisdictions are fiscal tax years and forward  with the exception of fiscal through amended state and local tax returns related to the reporting of federal audit adjustments 
the company has taken positions in certain taxing jurisdictions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease within the next twelve months 
the possible decrease could result from the finalization of the company s federal and various state income tax audits 
the company s federal income tax audit uncertainties primarily relate to research and development credits  while various state income tax audit uncertainties primarily relate to income from intangibles 
the estimated range of the reasonably possible uncertain tax benefit decrease in the next twelve months is between million and million 
discount rate 
the discount rate that the company utilizes for determining future pension obligations is based on the citigroup high grade corporate yield curve on its annual measurement date and is matched to the future expected cash flows of the benefit plans by annual periods 
the discount rate had increased to as of february  from as of february  we believe that these assumptions have been appropriate and that  based on these assumptions  the pension liability of million is appropriately stated as of february   however  actual results may differ materially from those estimated and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a further basis point change in the discount rate would generate an experience gain or loss of approximately million

aside from the lack of sales leverage  the dollars decreased between the two periods primarily as a result of a million charge in the prior year for a preliminary settlement agreement reached in a lawsuit filed on behalf of a putative class of former mercantile stores pension plan participants

cash flows for the three fiscal years ended were as follows percent change in thousands of dollars operating activities investing activities financing activities total cash used operating activities the primary source of the company s liquidity is cash flows from operations 
due to the seasonality of the company s business  it has historically realized a significant portion of the cash flows from operating activities during the second half of the fiscal year

the company received income of approximately million and million from ge in fiscal and while the company does not expect future cash flows under this alliance to vary significantly from historical levels  future amounts are difficult to predict 
the amount the company receives is dependent on the level of sales on ge accounts  the level of balances carried on the ge accounts by ge customers  payment rates on ge accounts  finance charge rates and other fees on ge accounts  the level of credit losses for the ge accounts as well as ge s funding costs
