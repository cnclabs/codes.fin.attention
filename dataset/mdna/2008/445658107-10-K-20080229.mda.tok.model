item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in item this discussion contains forward looking statements 
please see forward looking statements and risk factors for a discussion of items  uncertainties  assumptions and risks associated with these statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
therefore  the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following workers compensation and accident costs we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries workers compensation  vehicular collisions  accidents and cargo claims 
most of our insurance arrangements include a level of self insurance deductible coverage applicable to each claim  but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs that are completely insured 
our policies also include a contractual premium adjustment factor to be applied to incurred loss amounts at the end of months from each policy period inception 
this contractual adjustment factor is used to convert the self insured losses to fully insured losses and relieves us of any further liability on those claims 
our estimated accrual of ultimate losses includes these premium factors as part of the liability we recognize when the accidents occur 
the amounts of self insurance change from time to time based on certain measurement dates and policy expiration dates 
during  we were self insured for million per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and million per occurrence for workers compensation claims 
during and  we were self insured for  per occurrence for personal injury  property damage and workers compensation 
for  we are self insured for  per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and million for workers compensation claims 
our claims accrual policy for all self insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by third party claims administrators  as well as legal  economic and regulatory factors 
our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim 
the ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature  timing and extent of damages claimed becomes available 
accordingly  we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate claim liability 
this process involves the use of loss development factors based on our historical claims experience and includes the contractual premium adjustment factor mentioned above 
in doing so  the recorded liability considers future claims growth and conversion to fully insured status and provides an allowance for incurred but not reported claims 
we do not discount our estimated losses 
at december   we had an accrual of approximately million for estimated net claims 
in addition  we are required to pay certain advanced deposits and monthly premiums 
at december   we had a prepaid insurance asset of approximately million  which represented prefunded claims and premiums 
we are also substantially self insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment 
revenue equipment we operate a significant number of tractors  trucks  trailers and containers in connection with our business 
this equipment may be purchased or acquired under capital or operating lease agreements 
in addition  we may rent revenue equipment from third parties and various railroads under short term rental arrangements 
revenue equipment which is purchased is depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful life down to an estimated salvage or trade in value 
we periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies  in our consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of our plan to sell certain revenue equipment 
we have not identified any impairments to our remaining assets 
we have an agreement with our primary tractor supplier for residual or trade in values for certain new equipment 
we have utilized these trade in values  as well as other operational information  such as anticipated annual miles  in accounting for depreciation expense 
if our tractor supplier were unable to perform under the terms of our agreement for trade in values  it could have a material negative impact on our financial results 
we had no revenue equipment under capital lease arrangements at december  and revenue recognition we recognize revenue based on the relative transit time of the freight transported 
accordingly  a portion of the total revenue which will be billed to the customer once a load is delivered is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery service that has been completed at the end of the reporting period 
our trade accounts receivable includes accounts receivable reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts and reserves for revenue adjustments 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts and reserves for revenue adjustments are based on historical experience as well as any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectibility 
the adequacy of our allowances and reserves is reviewed quarterly 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with current accounting standards 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in taxable income or a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings 
deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our consolidated financial statements compared with when they are recognized in our tax returns 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe recovery is not probable  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  we include an expense as part of our income tax provision 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance at december   as all deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized 
significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain tax related contingencies on our provision for income taxes 
as part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes  we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position 
for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements 
such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments  whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates 
further  a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established an accrual  is audited and resolved 
see note  income taxes  in our consolidated financial statements  for a discussion of our current tax contingencies 
year in review highlights of significant events for calendar year include sixth consecutive year of record revenues 
continued strategy of transitioning our economic model from that of a primarily asset based truckload carrier to an asset light transportation company 
designated approximately tractors and  trailers in our jbt segment to sell in calendar year in connection with our strategy to reduce the jbt segment fleet size to the appropriate level  incurring a million pretax charge to record the revenue equipment to estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
completed a post appeals mediation with the irs and agreed to a settlement of a sale and leaseback transaction and other uncertain tax positions related to irs audits for tax years this settlement resulted in a million payment to the irs 
announced a new business segment  integrated capacity solutions  consistent with our asset light transportation company strategy 
purchased million shares of our common stock totaling million in  completing a series of authorized stock purchase programs totaling billion or million shares that commenced in calendar year issued million in senior notes through two issuances maturing in and  with proceeds used for stock purchases  revenue equipment purchases  primarily for our jbi and dcs segments  and other general working capital purposes 
increased our quarterly dividend to per share in january from in  and announced an additional increase to a quarterly dividend effective february our net earnings of million  or per diluted share  were down from the million  or per diluted share  earned in fuel costs continued to represent a challenge for the transportation industry during our fuel cost per gallon averaged above levels 
however  due to our fuel surcharge programs  we were able to recover the majority of our higher fuel costs 
freight demand during was relatively consistent for our jbi and dcs segments 
demand for dry van truck capacity was softer  particularly during the fourth quarter comparisons of dry van volumes to were negatively impacted by freight recessions including lower than expected seasonal demand during august through november of our jbi segment contributed to our higher level of profitability in  growing operating income by  while our jbt and dcs segments experienced a decline in operating income  as compared with  of and  respectively 
in response to changing market conditions and in continuance of focusing on growing segments that produce the greatest return on invested capital  we increased our jbi tractor and container counts by and  respectively  as well as increasing our dcs trailer count by 
we reduced our jbt company owned tractor fleet by  excluding tractors designated as held for sale 
we were able to affect some of these changes by transferring revenue equipment among our fleets 
we also continued our focus on capacity management during capacity management is a continuous process of reviewing our freight demand on a daily basis and our contractual relationships to determine which business application and segment generates the best returns 
we also continually analyze our business to ensure that we are charging a fair price for all services we provide 
our capacity management actions and changes in the shipper supply chain resulted in the conversion of freight from over the road truck operations to intermodal and dedicated services 
our consolidated operating ratio operating expenses divided by total operating revenues was  compared with in the current year was the fourth consecutive time that we have achieved an operating ratio for a full year below 
our operating income reflected an million pretax charge to write down the value of certain assets held for sale 
results of operations the following table sets forth items in our consolidated statements of earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items as compared with the prior year 
percentage of operating revenue percentage change between years vs 
vs 
operating revenues operating expenses rents and purchased transportation salaries  wages and employee benefits fuel and fuel taxes depreciation and amortization operating supplies and expenses insurance and claims operating taxes and licenses general and administrative expenses  net of asset dispositions communication and utilities arbitration settlement total operating expenses operating income net interest expense equity in loss of affiliated company earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings compared with consolidated operating revenues our total consolidated operating revenues rose to billion in  a increase over significantly higher fuel prices resulted in fuel surcharge fsc revenues of million in  compared with million in this fsc revenue impacted our year to year comparison 
if fsc revenues were excluded from both years  the increase of revenue over was 
this increased level of revenue  excluding fsc  was primarily a result of increases in load volume and price improvements as a result of our capacity management actions and ics business growth 
a and increase in jbi and ics load volume  respectively  contributed to our higher levels of revenue 
the increases in revenue of our jbi  dcs  and ics segments were partially offset by decreases in our jbt segment as a result of a smaller tractor fleet  rate declines and reduced tractor utilization due to decreasing freight demand in the jbt segment 
consolidated operating expenses our total consolidated operating expenses increased over the combination of the increase in revenue over and this increase in operating expenses resulted in a slight increase in our operating ratio to from in rents and purchased transportation costs rose in  primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads  drayage companies and third party carriers servicing ics 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in trailing equipment rentals due to our decision to purchase certain trailing equipment off operating leases during the total cost of salaries  wages and employee benefits decreased less than in from  primarily due to decreases in total driver pay 
this reduction in total driver pay was primarily a result of a decrease in the number of drivers in the jbt segment 
fuel and fuel taxes expense increased in  primarily due to higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon 
we have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers that allow us to recognize and adjust revenue charges relatively quickly when fuel costs change 
it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fsc revenue or the change of fsc revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods  as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads  dray carriers and other third parties 
these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 
while we are not always able to recover all fuel cost increases  partly due to empty miles run and engine idling time  we were able to recover the majority of our increased fuel costs 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was driven by our purchases of trailing equipment  including new containers and chassis for our jbi segment  as well as trailers purchased off operating leases 
operating supplies and expenses rose in  partly as a result of higher revenue equipment maintenance  including tractors and trailing equipment  as well as increased tire costs 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily related to the million pretax charge in the fourth quarter to write down the value of certain assets held for sale to fair value  less costs to sell 
this increase was also due to losses on asset sales of million in compared with gains on asset sales of million in our effective income tax rate was in and in the decrease in our effective tax rate compared with the prior year rate is primarily the result of our settlement on a proposed internal revenue service irs adjustment  which resulted in a million decrease of income tax expense in the second quarter see note  income taxes  for further information regarding this settlement 
we expect our effective income tax rate to approximate for calendar year the equity in loss of affiliated company item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of tpi 
segments we operated four business segments during calendar year the operation of each of these businesses is described in our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment 
operating revenue by segment years ended december in millions jbi dcs jbt ics subtotal inter segment eliminations total operating income by segment years ended december in millions jbi dcs jbt ics other total reflects a million bni arbitration settlement charge in includes an million pretax charge in to write down the value of certain assets held for sale

the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily a result of changes in freight mix and fuel surcharge revenue 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in revenue per load due to a decrease in the average length of haul of from operating income in our jbi segment rose to million in  from million in while increased volumes contributed to higher operating margins  we were able to reduce the number of empty truck miles in our pickup and delivery operations  increase our driver productivity and significantly reduce our reliance on third party equipment and drayage 
all of these factors contributed to increasing our operating income by in dcs segment dcs segment revenue grew to million in  from million in this increase in revenue was primarily due to a increase in revenue per truck per week and a slightly higher average truck count 
operating income decreased to million in  compared with million in the decrease in operating income was primarily the result of an increase in driver compensation  increases in fuel costs and higher casualty and workers compensation costs in compared with jbt segment jbt segment revenue declined to million in  from million in the decrease in revenue was primarily a result of a decrease in load count  due to much softer demand in compared with an approximate decrease in rates also contributed to the decrease in revenue 
operating income in our jbt segment declined to million in  from million in in addition to reduced revenue from lower load volume  operating expenses were higher in  compared with  due to increases in tractor maintenance and tire costs 
in addition  we recorded an million pretax charge in december to write down the value of certain assets held for sale 
ics segment ics segment revenue grew to million in  from million in this increase in revenue was primarily due to a increase in load volume from both new and existing customers operating income increased nearly to million in  compared with million in the large revenue growth was partially offset by increased operating expenses  including higher personnel and technology costs related to growing and investing in the ics segment 
in the second half of  we were able to gain operating leverage from the higher revenue growth that began to cover higher operating expenses 
compared with overview of consolidated results our total consolidated operating revenues rose to billion in  a increase over significantly higher fuel prices resulted in fsc revenues of million in  compared with million in this fsc revenue impacted our year to year comparison 
if fsc revenues were excluded from both years  the increase of revenue over was 
this increased level of revenue  excluding fsc  was primarily a result of increases in load volume and price improvements as a result of our capacity management actions 
a and increase in jbi and dcs load volume  respectively  contributed to our higher levels of revenue 
the increases in revenue of our jbi and dcs segments were partially offset by decreases in our jbt segment as a result of a smaller tractor fleet and a decline in tractor utilization 
demand for dry van truck capacity was softer  particularly during the fourth quarter of comparisons of dry van volumes to were negatively impacted by hurricane relief shipments in and lower than expected seasonal demand during august through november of partly in response to changing market conditions  we increased the size of our jbi and dcs tractor fleets by and  respectively  and decreased our jbt fleet by 
consolidated operating expenses our total consolidated operating expenses increased over the combination of the increase in revenue over and this increase in operating expenses resulted in our operating ratio improving slightly to from in rents and purchased transportation costs rose in  primarily due to additional funds paid to railroads and drayage companies related to jbi growth 
the total cost of salaries  wages and employee benefits increased in over  primarily due to higher levels of driver compensation 
fuel and fuel taxes expense was up in  primarily due to higher fuel cost per gallon and slightly lower fuel miles per gallon 
it is not meaningful to compare the amount of fsc revenue or the change of fsc revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense or the change of fuel expense between periods  as a significant portion of fuel costs is included in our payments to railroads  dray carriers and other third parties 
these payments are classified as purchased transportation expense 
while we are not always able to recover all fuel cost increases  partly due to empty miles run and engine idling time  we were able to recover the majority of our increased fuel costs 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was driven by our trailing equipment purchases  higher new tractor purchase prices  and an approximate increase in the size of our company owned tractor fleet 
operating supplies and expenses rose in  partly a result of higher tractor maintenance  tires and tolls costs 
a number of states have raised their rates for highway and bridge tolls 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses reflects driver recruiting and testing costs  legal and professional fees related to our arbitration proceeding  and charitable contributions in that declined or did not reoccur in also included in the general and administrative expense category  we recognized a million net gain on the disposition of assets in  compared with a million gain in the arbitration settlement expense incurred during was due to the bni arbitration decision discussed in the section on operating segments 
we accrued approximately million of interest expense during related to an irs contingency 
our effective income tax rate was in and the equity in loss of affiliated company item on our consolidated statement of earnings reflects our share of the operating results of tpi 
jbi segment jbi segment revenue grew by to billion in  from billion in a significant portion of this revenue growth was driven by a increase in load volume 
in addition  freight rates increased nearly over the remaining portion of revenue growth was primarily a result of changes in freight mix and fuel surcharge revenue 
operating income in our jbi segment rose to million in  from million in the million arbitration settlement charge incurred in september favorably impacted this comparison 
while this settlement also increased rail purchased transportation expense subsequent to october   higher freight rates  increased volumes and reduced use of rail control equipment increased operating income 
dcs segment dcs segment revenue grew to million in  from million in this increase in revenue was primarily due to a increase in load volume  an approximate increase in rates and higher fuel surcharge revenue 
operating income increased to million in  compared with million in similar to  we conducted reviews of our underperforming dedicated accounts and identified opportunities to either improve margins or redeploy assets 
financial discipline in the area of pricing and contract structure helped ensure that new business during generated appropriate financial returns 
we also remained focused on cost controls and raised rates when appropriate 
jbt segment jbt segment revenue declined to million in  from million in this decline was primarily due to a reduction in load volume 
while rates from consistent shippers increased approximately during  a decline in rates from spot and backup pricing and paid empty movements partly offset these increases 
operating income in our jbt segment declined to million in  from million in the decrease was due  in part  to lower levels of tractor utilization and to higher driver compensation and insurance costs 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities relative to  after consideration of adjustments for noncash items such as depreciation  share based compensation and impairment charges  was due primarily to the timing of cash activity related to trade accounts receivable and payable 
cash flows used in investing activities primarily reflect additions to and dispositions from our fleet of revenue equipment 
the lower level of cash used in investing activities during was primarily a result of decreases in trailing equipment purchases 
at december   we had no revenue equipment on capital leases 
net cash used in financing activities during increased over  primarily due to the purchase of million of our common stock 
this increase was partially offset by an increase in proceeds from long term debt issuances 
during  we issued million of senior notes 
funds from these issuances were used primarily for purchases of our company stock  purchases of revenue equipment and for general working capital purposes 
selected balance sheet data as of december working capital ratio current maturities of long term debt millions total debt millions total debt to equity total debt as a percentage of total capital our dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the board of directors and payments are dependent upon our financial condition  earnings  capital requirements and any other factors the board of directors may deem relevant

we paid an per share dividend in february  april  july  and october in january  we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from to  effective with our payments in february  april  july  and october in january  we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from to  effective with our payment in february we currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis 
however  no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid 
liquidity our need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of intermodal trailing equipment  trucks  tractors and dry van trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment with new  late model equipment 
we are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements depending on market conditions 
we have  during the past few years  obtained capital through cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit and most recently issued long term debt to acquire trailers that were previously leased 
we have also periodically utilized operating leases to acquire revenue equipment 
we had no capital lease arrangements at december  to date  none of our operating leases contains any guaranteed residual value clauses 
at december   we were authorized to borrow up to a total of million under two different revolving lines of credit 
the first line of credit is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks for a total commitment amount of million 
effective march   we entered into a new senior revolving credit facility agreement  which replaced our previous senior revolving credit facility dated april  this new credit facility has a five year term expiring march  in june  we exercised a feature of the agreement that allowed us to increase our total commitment amount from million to million 
the applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the prime rate or libor  depending upon the specific type of borrowing  plus a margin based on the level of borrowings and our credit rating 
at december   we had million outstanding at an average interest rate of under this agreement 
our second line of credit is an accounts receivable securitization program with a revolving credit facility up to million 
this facility is secured by our accounts receivable  and we renewed this facility at maturity on july   for a one year term maturing on july  the applicable interest rate under this agreement is the prevailing a p commercial paper rate in the market plus a margin based on our level of borrowing and commercial paper dealer fees 
at december   we had million outstanding at an average interest rate of under this agreement 
on march   we sold million of senior notes notes  which mature march   to various purchasers through a private placement offering pursuant to our note purchase agreement dated march  the proceeds were used for the purchase of trailing equipment off operating leases and for general working capital purposes 
the notes were issued at par value 
interest payments are due semiannually  in march and september of each year 
on july   we sold million of senior notes notes  which mature july   to various purchasers through a private placement offering pursuant to our note purchase agreement dated july  proceeds from these notes have been utilized to purchase shares of our common stock  pay down existing debt on our revolving credit facilities and finance capital expenditures for revenue equipment 
the notes were issued at par value 
principal payments in the amount of million are due july   and july   with the remainder due upon maturity 
interest payments are due semiannually  in january and july of each year 
the note purchase agreements describe the terms and conditions of both notes  which include requirements to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios 
on september   we entered into a million term loan and credit agreement in connection with our purchase of used  dry van trailers 
this million facility is collateralized by a security interest in the trailing equipment and matures september  we are required to make minimum quarterly principal payments in the amount of million  through june   with the remainder due upon maturity 
stated interest on this facility is a three month libor variable rate 
concurrent with the loan and credit agreement  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert this floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis of 
the swap expires september   when the related term loan is due 
at december   we had million outstanding under this credit agreement 
our revolving lines of credit and debt facilities require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at december  we believe that our liquid assets  cash generated from operations and revolving lines of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
decreases in our working capital ratio were primarily driven by our increases in debt issuances to purchase revenue equipment and our common stock 
as mentioned above  we had significant expenditures related to new trailing equipment for we are currently committed to spend approximately million during  which is primarily related to tractors and containers 
the actual cash expended will be net of proceeds from sale or trade in allowances on revenue equipment 
off balance sheet arrangements our only off balance sheet arrangements are related to our operating leases for trailing equipment and some limited data processing equipment and facilities 
as of december   we had approximately trailers and  containers chassis that were subject to operating leases  and we had approximately million of obligations remaining under these leases 
contractual cash obligations as of december  amounts due by period total one year or less one to three years four to five years after five years operating leases long term debt obligations commitments to acquire revenue equipment facilities land total we had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately million at december   that expire at various dates in fiscal year  which are related to our self insured retention levels for casualty and workers compensation claims  and our operating lease agreements 
we plan to renew these letters of credit in accordance with our third party agreements 
the table above excludes million of liabilities under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate timing of settlement 
see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
recent accounting pronouncements fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements 
fas does not expand or require new fair value measures  but is applicable whenever an asset or liability is permitted or required to be measured at fair value 
fas became effective for us beginning january  in february  the fasb agreed to a one year delay of fas for certain nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
accordingly  adoption of this standard is limited to financial assets and liabilities  which primarily applies to the valuation of our interest rate swap 
we do not believe the initial adoption of fas will have a significant impact on our earnings or financial condition 
we are still in the process of assessing the impact of fas on our consolidated financial statements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities fas 
fas permits entities to choose to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
fas became effective for us on january  we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a significant impact on our earnings or financial condition as we expect election of this option to be limited 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of our total million of debt  we had million of variable rate debt outstanding at december   under our revolving lines of credit 
the interest rates applicable to these agreements are based on either the prime rate or libor 
our earnings would be affected by changes in these short term interest rates 
risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a near term adverse increase in short term interest rates 
at our current level of borrowing  a increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by approximately million 
our remaining debt is effectively fixed rate debt  and therefore changes in market interest rates do not directly impact our interest expense 
periodically  we enter into derivative instruments in response to market interest rates 
although we conduct business in foreign countries  international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended december  accordingly  we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather and other market factors 
historically  we have been able to recover a majority of fuel price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
we cannot predict the extent to which high fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations
