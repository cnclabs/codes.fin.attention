sales to difm customers represented approximately of our aap sales in and consisted of sales to both walk in commercial customers and sales delivered to our commercial customers place of business  including independent garages  service stations and auto dealers 
our commercial strategy consists of the development of commercial marketing and merchandising initiatives with the continued focus on getting our difm customers to use us as their first call supplier 
at december   we had  aap stores with commercial delivery programs  or of total aap stores  which was slightly up from at december  store development 
our store development program has historically focused on adding new stores within existing markets  relocating and remodeling existing stores and entering new markets 
the addition of new stores  along with strategic acquisitions  has played a significant role in our growth and success

table of contents store technology 
our store based information systems  which are designed to improve the efficiency of our operations and enhance customer service  are comprised of a proprietary point of sale  or pos  system and electronic parts catalog  or epc  system 
information maintained by our pos system is used to formulate pricing  marketing and merchandising strategies and to replenish inventory accurately and rapidly 
our pos system is fully integrated with our epc system that enables our store team members to assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on year  make  model and engine type of their vehicles 
our centrally based epc data management system enables us to reduce the time needed to exchange data with our vendors and ultimately catalog and deliver updated  accurate product information 
our epc system also contains enhanced search engines and user friendly navigation tools that enhance our team members ability to look up any needed parts as well as additional products the customer needs to complete their automotive repair project 
if a hard to find part or accessory is not available at one of our stores  the epc system can determine whether the part is carried and in stock through our pdq system 
available parts and accessories are then ordered electronically from another store  law  pdq or master pdq with immediate confirmation of price  availability and estimated delivery time 
we also support our store operations with additional proprietary systems 
our store level inventory management system provides real time inventory tracking at the store level 
with the store level system  store team members can check the quantity of on hand inventory for any sku  adjust stock levels for select items for store specific events  automatically process returns and defective merchandise  designate skus for cycle counts and track merchandise transfers 
our stores use radio frequency hand held devices to help ensure the accuracy of our inventory 
our standard operating procedure  or sop  system is a web based  electronic data management system that allows our team members instant and quick access to any of our standard operating procedures through a comprehensive on line search function 
additionally  we utilize a labor scheduling system known as management planning and training  or mpt 
all of these systems are tightly integrated and together provide real time  comprehensive information to store personnel  resulting in improved customer service levels  team member productivity and in stock availability 
store support center merchandising 
purchasing for virtually all of the merchandise for our stores is handled by our centralized corporate offices in roanoke  virginia  or store support center 
in  we purchased merchandise from over vendors  with no single vendor accounting for more than of purchases 
our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with certain vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms  including pricing  payment terms and volume 
our merchandising team is skilled in sourcing high quality products globally and maintaining consistent inventory levels 
the merchandising team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and  in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners  utilizes a category management process 
we believe this process  which develops a customer focused business plan for each merchandise category  has been highly effective and is critical to improving comparable store sales  gross margin and inventory turns 
our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality brand name automotive parts and accessories such as bosch  castrol  sylvania  prestone  monroe  bendix  purolator  dayco and trico  which generates diy customer traffic and also appeals to commercial customers 
in addition to these branded products  we stock a wide selection of high quality proprietary products that appeal to value conscious customers 
these lines of merchandise include everything from chemical and wash and wax products to tools  batteries  parts and interior automotive accessories under the names of professional s favoritetm  joe s garagetm  mechanic s choicetm  auto xpresstm  autocrafttm  endurancetm  wearevertm  jobmatetm and miragetm 
supply chain 
our supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation functions which support a logistics network of distribution centers  pdq warehouses and stores 
our inventory management team utilizes a replenishment system  or e  to monitor the distribution center  pdq warehouse and store inventory levels and order additional product when appropriate while streamlining costs associated with the handling of that product 
e utilizes the most up to date information from our pos system as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon history  sales trends by sku  seasonality and demographic shifts in demand 
e 
table of contents combines these factors with service level goals  vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders 
a significant portion of our purchase orders are sent via electronic data interchange  with the remainder being sent by computer generated e mail or facsimile 
our transportation team utilizes a transportation management system for efficiently managing incoming shipments to the distribution centers and stores 
benefits from this system include reduced vendor to distribution center freight costs  visibility of purchase orders and shipments for the entire supply chain  a reduction in distribution center inventory  or safety stock  due to consistent transit times  decreased third party freight and billing service costs  decreased distribution center to store freight costs and higher store in stock position 
we currently operate eight distribution centers 
all of these distribution centers are equipped with our distribution center management system  or dcms 
our dcms provides real time inventory tracking through the processes of receiving  picking  shipping and replenishing at our distribution centers 
the dcms  integrated with technologically advanced material handling equipment  significantly reduces warehouse and distribution costs  while improving efficiency 
this equipment includes carousels  pick to light systems  robotic picking  radio frequency technology  voice technology and automated sorting systems 
through the continued implementation of our supply chain initiatives we expect to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution capacity 
we believe our current capacity will allow us to support in excess of  stores 
during  we announced our plan to build a new distribution center in indiana now scheduled to open in early we currently offer approximately  skus to substantially support all of our retail stores via our stand alone pdq warehouses and or our eight distribution centers all of which stock pdq items 
stores have visibility to inventory in their respective facilities and can place orders to these facilities  or as an alternative  through an online ordering system to virtually any of the other facilities 
ordered parts are delivered to substantially all stores on a same day or next day basis through our dedicated pdq trucking fleet and third party carriers 
store inventories are replenished from our eight distribution centers 
in addition  we operate a master pdq warehouse that stocks  incremental skus of harder to find automotive parts and accessories and utilizes our existing pdq distribution infrastructure and or third party arrangements to provide next day service to substantially all of our stores 
advertising 
we have an extensive advertising program designed to communicate our merchandise offerings  parts assortment and availability  competitive prices  free services and commitment to customer service 
the program is focused on establishing advance auto parts as the resource for a customer s automotive needs 
we use a mix of media that reinforces our brand image  including television  radio  promotional signage  outdoor media  print and our internet site 
our advertising plan is a brand building program built around television and radio advertising 
the plan is supported by in store signage  online advertising and print 
our television advertising is a combination of national and regional media in both sports and entertainment programming 
radio advertising generally airs during peak drive times 
we use spanish language radio and television advertising to market to our hispanic customers 
our advertising program is also supported through sponsorships of sporting events  racing teams and other events at all levels in a grass roots effort to positively impact individual communities  including hispanic and other ethnic communities  to create awareness and drive traffic for our stores 
since  we have used an integrated consumer education program to build our image as not only the source for parts  but also the best resource for vehicle information 
our goal with this initiative is to continue our long term brand building success  increase customer loyalty and expand our customer base 
in february  we launched a new branding campaign  keep the wheels turning 
this campaign was developed based on a strategic review of our business as well as extensive research conducted with our customers and team members 
we believe this campaign  which targets both diy and difm customers will differentiate advance auto parts in our industry by positioning us as the source for brand name parts and products and as the resource for expert advice and knowledge to help customers keep their vehicles running 
the campaign includes creative and compelling television and radio commercials designed to drive sales and build an enduring  positive image of advance auto parts 

table of contents ai segment we acquired ai in september the acquisition  which included stores throughout new england and new york  a distribution center and ai s wholesale distribution business  complements our growing presence in the difm market in the northeast 
ai s business primarily serves the commercial market from its store locations 
in addition  its north american sales division services warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america 
we believe ai provides a high level of service to its commercial customers by providing quality parts  unsurpassed customer service and efficient parts delivery 
as a result of its extensive sourcing network  ai is able to serve its customers in search of replacement parts for both domestic and imported cars and light trucks with a greater focus on imported parts 
the vast majority of ai s product is sold under its proprietary brand 
the ai stores offer an average of  skus with access to an additional  unique skus through its logistics network 
at december   we operated stores under the autopart international trade name in the following states throughout the northeast number of number of number of location stores location stores location stores connecticut new hampshire pennsylvania maine new jersey rhode island massachusetts new york vermont the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our ai stores beginning stores new stores stores closed ending stores of the new stores in  stores were acquired in september as a result of our ai acquisition 
seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months 
in addition  our business can be affected by weather conditions 
while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods  extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate 
team members at february   we employed  full time team members and  part time team members 
our workforce consisted of of our team members employed in store level operations  employed in distribution and employed in our corporate offices 
we have never experienced any labor disruption and are not party to any collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our team member relations are good 

table of contents intellectual property we own a number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service marks and trademarks  including advance auto parts  western auto  parts america  autopart international and pdq for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business 
in addition  we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our proprietary products 
we believe that these trade names  service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy 
we do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks  and we actively defend and enforce them 
competition we operate in both the diy and difm markets of the automotive aftermarket industry 
our primary competitors are i both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts stores  including autozone  inc  o reilly automotive  inc  csk auto corporation and the pep boys manny  moe jack  ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products  iii wholesalers or jobber stores  including those associated with national parts distributors or associations  such as napa and carquest  iv independent operators and v automobile dealers that supply parts 
we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that  like us  have multiple locations in one or more markets  have competitive advantages in customer service  marketing  inventory selection  purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers 
the principal methods of competition in our business include store location  availability  customer service and product offerings  quality and price 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business  including those governing recycling of lead acid batteries and used oil  and ownership and operation of real property 
we sell consumer products containing hazardous materials as part of our business 
in addition  our customers may bring lead acid batteries or used oil onto our properties 
we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used automotive  lead acid batteries and used oil at all of our stores as a service to our customers 
pursuant to agreements with third party vendors  lead acid batteries and used oil are collected by our team members  deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal 
the terms of our contracts with the third party vendors provide that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
persons who arrange for the removal  disposal  treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal  treatment or other site affected by such substances 
based on our experience  we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting lead acid batteries and used oil as these costs are borne by the respective third parties 
we own and lease real property 
under various environmental laws and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release of such hazardous or toxic substances 
other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place  and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances 
from time to time  we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own  lease or operate or may have owned  leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible 
compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our operations to date

risk factors 
risks relating to our business we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy  including increasing comparable store sales  enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have implemented numerous initiatives to increase comparable store sales  enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow 
if these initiatives are unsuccessful  or if we are unable to implement the initiatives efficiently and effectively  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control 
adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy general economic conditions and conditions in our local markets  which could reduce our sales  the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket parts and accessories retail sector that may force us to reduce prices beyond our normal control or increase promotional spending  changes in the automotive aftermarket parts manufacturing industry  such as consolidation  which may disrupt or sever one or more of our vendor relationships  our ability to anticipate and meet changes in consumer preferences and or needs for automotive products particularly parts availability  accessories and services in a timely manner  our ability to stimulate diy customer traffic  and our continued ability to hire and retain qualified personnel  which depends in part on the types of recruiting  training  compensation and benefit programs we adopt or maintain 
we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful  which could negatively impact our financial results 
we have increased our store count significantly from stores at the end of to  stores at december  we intend to continue to expand our base of stores as part of our growth strategy  primarily by opening new stores 
we may not assure you that the implementation of this strategy will be successful 
the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors  including  among other things our ability to manage the expansion and hire  train and retain qualified sales associates  the availability of potential store locations in highly visible  well trafficked areas  and the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations 
we may not assure you that we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales 
the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on our ability to properly merchandise  market and price the products required in their respective markets 
furthermore  we may acquire stores or businesses from  make investments in  or enter into strategic alliances with  companies that have stores or distribution networks in our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence 
any future acquisitions  investments  strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by risks  including the difficulty of identifying appropriate strategic partners or acquisition candidates  the difficulty of assimilating and integrating the operations of the respective entities  the potential disruption to our ongoing business and diversion of our management s attention  the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and the impairment of relationships with team members and customers as a result of changes in management 

table of contents we may not assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with these acquisitions  investments  strategic alliances or related efforts 
if we fail to successfully open and operate new stores or make strategic acquisitions or alliances  then our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted 
if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will suffer 
overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow for any number of reasons  including the weather  as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of unfavorable weather  the economy  as during periods of good economic conditions  more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own cars 
in periods of declining economic conditions  including higher fuel prices  higher credit costs  possible recession and other factors  both diy and difm customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair  the decline of the average age of vehicles  miles driven or number of cars on the road may result in a reduction in the demand for our product offerings  and the refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available to the automotive aftermarket industry diagnostic  repair and maintenance information that our diy and difm customers require to diagnose  repair and maintain their vehicles may force consumers to have all diagnostic work  repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer network 
if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will suffer 
we depend on the services of many qualified team members and may not be able to attract and retain such qualified team members 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our many team members 
at february   we employed  team members 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our current qualified team members as well as attract and retain additional qualified team members that may be needed in the future 
our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package 
if we fail to maintain such a package  our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry  we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 
the sale of automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways  including location  price  name recognition and customer service 
we compete in both the diy and difm categories of the automotive aftermarket industry  and primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains  ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products  iii wholesalers or jobber stores  iv independent operators and v automobile dealers that supply parts 
these competitors and the level of competition vary by market 
some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share  including a greater amount of marketing activities  a larger number of stores  longer operating histories  greater name recognition or larger and more established customer bases 
our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices beyond our normal control or increase our promotional spending  which would lower revenue and profitability 
competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines or require us to discontinue current product offerings or change some of our current operating strategies 
if we do not have the resources or expertise or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages  we could lose customers and our revenues may decline 

table of contents disruptions in our relationships with vendors or in our vendors operations could increase our cost of goods sold 
our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and upon the vendors ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms 
many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms 
for example  financial or operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face may increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or the ability for us to source product from them 
in addition  the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors  and could lead to less competition and  consequently  higher prices 
because we are involved in litigation from time to time  and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations  we could incur substantial judgments  fines  legal fees and other costs 
we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers  employees or other third parties for various actions 
from time to time  we are involved in litigation involving claims related to  among other things  breach of contract  tortious conduct  employment discrimination  payment of wages  asbestos exposure  real estate matters and product defects 
the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial 
although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims  if one or more of the claims greatly exceeds our coverage limits or our insurance policies do not cover a claim  it could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results 
additionally  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to employment matters  environmental protection  product quality standards and building and zoning requirements 
if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations  we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions 
in addition  our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 
war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and adversely impact our sales 
war or acts of terrorism  or the threat of either  may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores 
some of our merchandise is imported from other countries 
if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states  and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs  our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 
in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed  our business may be adversely impacted  as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores 
risks relating to our financial condition the covenants governing our revolving and term loan facilities impose restrictions on us 
the terms of our revolving and term loan facilities impose operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial tests 
these restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows by significantly limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions  including incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness  making capital expenditures and other investments  incurring liens on our assets and engaging in sale leaseback transactions  issuing or selling capital stock of our subsidiaries  transferring or selling assets currently held by us  and engaging in mergers or acquisitions 

table of contents the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our credit facilities 
furthermore  our credit facilities contain certain financial covenants  including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum coverage ratio  which  if not maintained by us  will cause us to be in default under our credit facilities 
any of these defaults  if not waived  could result in the acceleration of all of our debt  in which case the debt would become immediately due and payable 
if this occurs  we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it 
even if new financing were available  it may be on terms that are less favorable or otherwise not acceptable to us

to date  these products have included brake and clutch parts and roofing materials 
many of the cases pending against us or our subsidiaries are in the early stages of litigation 
the damages claimed against the defendants in some of these proceedings are substantial

introduction we primarily operate within the united states automotive aftermarket industry  which includes replacement parts excluding tires  accessories  maintenance items  batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks pickup trucks  vans  minivans and sport utility vehicles 
we currently are the second largest specialty retailer of automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items to do it yourself  or diy  and do it for me  or difm  customers in the united states  based on store count and sales 
at december   we operated  stores throughout states 
we operate in two reportable segments advance auto parts  or aap  and autopart international  or ai 
the aap segment is comprised of our store operations within the united states  puerto rico and the virgin islands which operate under the trade names advance auto parts  advance discount auto parts and western auto 
at december   we operated  stores in the aap segment  of which  stores operated under the trade names advance auto parts and advance discount auto parts throughout states in the northeastern  southeastern and midwestern regions of the united states 
these stores offer automotive replacement parts  accessories and maintenance items 
in addition  we operated stores under the western auto and advance auto parts trade names  located in puerto rico and the virgin islands  or offshore 
at december   we operated stores in the ai segment under the autopart international trade name 
we acquired ai in september  and ai operates as an independent  wholly owned subsidiary 
ai s business primarily serves the commercial market from its store locations 
in addition  its north american sales division services warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america

the footnotes contain descriptions regarding the calculation of these metrics 

table of contents management overview we recorded earnings per diluted share of in fiscal compared to for fiscal we continue to generate significant operating cash flow to allow us to invest in business initiatives and return capital to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases 
we remain focused on increasing our sales  operating margins and return on invested capital and believe certain strategic initiatives introduced during are beginning to propel us toward achieving these goals 
specific updates on these initiatives  among other recent developments  during are discussed below new ceo we announced in november the appointment of a new ceo and president  darren jackson  which became effective in january mr 
jackson  who previously served on our audit committee  finance committee and board of directors  had already been involved with management on the completion of certain strategic studies during and the formulation of certain initiatives discussed below 
sales initiatives we believe our biggest opportunity is increasing our top line sales growth as we develop initiatives around a more customer focused strategy and increased parts availability and related knowledge by the team members in our stores 
our sales per square foot and sales per employee are currently in the bottom half of the automotive aftermarket industry 
in  we began implementing our plan to increase diy and difm sales through improving parts availability with an emphasis on late model and foreign vehicles 
our enhanced parts availability will be funded partially from available working capital as we transition from other less productive inventory 
we believe our difm business has started to improve as indicated by an comparable store sales increase during the fourth quarter  although we continue to face a challenging macroeconomic environment  including higher fuel and credit costs faced by our customers  higher unemployment and lower consumer confidence 
in order to structure our difm business for further growth  we continue to examine store staffing and training  compensation policies and truck utilization 
commercial sales represented approximately of our total sales for fiscal as compared to approximately for fiscal at december   we operated commercial programs in of our total aap stores compared to for the prior fiscal year 
lastly  we began improving the productivity and efficiency of our sales floor in our stores by aligning functions performed by our sales associates with our increased parts focus  including the transition of less productive inventory 
sg a structure we took significant steps towards reducing and reallocating our selling  general and administrative expense structure during the second half of we eliminated positions at our store support center and other field support areas and terminated our advance tv network  which together resulted in million of expense recognized in our operating results 
additionally  we reduced our real estate development by opening fewer new stores  relocating fewer stores and halting the store remodel program 
during the fourth quarter of  we introduced a  square foot prototype store 
we believe this smaller model can support an adequate level of parts availability for both our diy and difm customers while reducing our occupancy costs as a percentage of sales 
lastly  we completed the further reduction and reallocation of certain advertising expenditures into a more focused effort in electronic media 
we have recently introduced a new brand  keep the wheels turning 
this campaign was developed as part of our overall strategic review of the business as well as extensive research conducted with our customers and team members 
we believe this campaign  which targets both diy and difm customers  differentiates advance auto parts in our industry by positioning us as the source for brand name parts and products and as the resource for expert advice and knowledge to help customers keep their vehicles running 
the campaign includes creative and compelling television and radio commercials designed to drive sales and build an enduring  positive image of advance auto parts 
due to the reallocation of our advertising expenditures  we expect advertising expense to remain generally consistent with levels 
return on invested capital improvements we eliminated certain information technology  logistics and other investments that did not demonstrate acceptable returns 
during the second half of  we halted our store remodel program while we more closely examine the sales results and overall return from these remodels 
additionally  we have delayed the opening of our ninth distribution center to the beginning of as a result of fewer new store openings planned throughout 
table of contents stock repurchase program during  our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to million of our common stock plus related expenses 
the program  which became effective august   replaced the remaining portion of a million stock repurchase program 
during  we repurchased million shares of common stock for million 
refer to further discussion of this program in the liquidity section of this management s discussion and analysis 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates 
vendor incentives we receive incentives from vendors as a result of purchasing and promoting their products through a variety of programs  including cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates and other promotional incentives 
we account for vendor incentives in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
many of the incentives are under long term agreements terms in excess of one year  while others are negotiated on an annual basis 
cooperative advertising allowances and volume rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and initially recorded as a reduction to inventory 
the deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 
we recognize other promotional incentives earned under long term agreements as a reduction to cost of sales 
these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement 
our margins could be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from our estimates  however  the impact over the life of the agreement would be the same 
short term incentives terms less than one year are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the agreements 
amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue 
management s estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities 
earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables except for that portion expected to be received after one year  which is included in other assets 
inventory reserves we establish reserves for inventory shrink  as an increase to our cost of sales  for our stores and distribution centers based on our extensive and frequent cycle counting program 
our estimates of these shrink reserves depend on the accuracy of the program  which is dependent on compliance rates of our facilities and the execution of the required procedures 
we evaluate the accuracy of this program on an ongoing basis and believe it provides reasonable assurance for the established reserves 
if estimates regarding our cycle counting program are inaccurate  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
we have recorded reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on current inventory levels and historical analysis of product sales and current market conditions 
the nature of our inventory is such that the risk of obsolescence is minimal and excess inventory has historically been returned to our vendors for credit 
we provide reserves where less than full credit is expected from a vendor or where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded cost 
we develop these estimates based on the determination of return privileges with vendors  the level of credit provided by the vendor and management s estimate of the discounts to recorded 
table of contents cost  if any  required by market conditions 
our total inventory reserves increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as the result of an increase in our total shrinkage  as a percentage of sales 
future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
a difference in actual inventory reserves at december  would have affected net income by approximately million 
warranty reserves our vendors are primarily responsible for warranty claims 
we are responsible for merchandise sold under warranty which is not covered by vendor warranties primarily batteries 
we record a reserve for future warranty claims as an increase in our cost of sales based on current sales of the warranted products and historical claim experience 
if claims experience differs from historical levels  revisions in our estimates may be required  which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
our warranty reserves increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to an increase in our defective return rate as well as an increase in the sale of premium batteries 
a change in the warranty reserves at december  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  self insured reserves we are self insured for general and automobile liability  workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members  although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total liability exposure 
our self insurance program  started in  has not reached full maturity 
a reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed and claims incurred but not yet reported using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience 
each year  our reserve for self insurance increases over the prior year because each year adds an additional layer of reserves without an equal amount of prior year reserves being fully relieved 
generally  claims have historically taken several years to settle and thus are not relieved at the same rate as additional reserves are added each year 
our self insurance reserves increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily the result of the increase in the number of workers compensation claims and automobile accident claims as well as an increase in the total cost to settle workers compensation claims as compared to the prior year 
the increase in the number of claims is driven by overall growth  including an increase in total number of stores  employees and commercial delivery vehicles 
while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  our self insurance reserves and corresponding selling  general and administrative expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions 
a change in our self insurance liabilities at december  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december tax reserves the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax code  regulations and pronouncements of the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business 
our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions 
these examinations include  among other things  auditing our filing positions  the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions 
at any particular time  multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
the accounting for our tax reserves changed with the adoption of fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  on december  refer to note for further discussion of the impact of adopting fin and change in reserves during fiscal in evaluating our income tax positions  we record reserves for potential exposures 
these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change 
those developments could be  but are not limited to  settlement of tax audits  expiration of the statute of limitations  and the evolution of tax code and 
table of contents regulations  along with varying application of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 
these tax reserves contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions 
although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ and the company may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates  the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 
favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution 
a change in the tax reserves at december  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended december  components of statement of operations net sales net sales consist primarily of comparable store sales and new store net sales 
we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in net sales starting once a store has been opened for complete accounting periods 
we include relocations in comparable store sales from the original date of opening 
we exclude from comparable store sales the net sales from the offshore and ai stores 
cost of sales our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  net of incentives under vendor programs  inventory shrinkage  defective and warranty costs  and warehouse and distribution expenses 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by variations in our product mix  price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs  vendor programs  inventory shrinkage  defective and warranty costs and warehouse and distribution costs 
we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into long term purchasing agreements  without minimum purchase volume requirements  with vendors when we believe it is advantageous 
our gross profit may not be comparable to those of our competitors due to differences in industry practice regarding the classification of certain costs 
see note in our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of store payroll  store occupancy including rent  advertising expenses  other store expenses and general and administrative expenses  including salaries and related benefits of store support center team members  share based compensation expense  store support center administrative office expenses  data processing  professional expenses and other related expenses

in addition  we have used available funds to repurchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program and to repay borrowings under our credit facility 
we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities as needed 
we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations  available cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our term loan and revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million  an increase of million compared to fiscal year end this increase resulted from an increase in cash flow from operations and proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by the continued investment in property and equipment  reduction in our revolving credit facility balance and return of capital to our shareholders through the payment of dividends and repurchase of common stock during at december   our outstanding indebtedness was million higher when compared to and consisted of borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility  million under our term loan  and million outstanding on an economic development note

during  we anticipate adding new aap and ai stores and relocating to aap stores 
we do not plan to remodel any stores in we also plan to make continued investments in the maintenance of our existing stores and logistics network as well as investing in new information systems to support certain initiatives  including our parts availability initiative 
in  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million to million 

table of contents vendor financing program historically  we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help finance inventory growth  and we believe that we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory growth through such extended payment terms 
we have a short term financing program with a bank for certain merchandise purchases 
in substance  the program allows us to borrow money from the bank to finance purchases from our vendors 
this program allows us to reduce further our working capital invested in current inventory levels and finance future inventory growth 
our revolving and term loan facilities do not restrict availability under this program 
at december   million was payable to the bank by us under this program 
stock repurchase program during the third quarter of fiscal  our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to million of our common stock plus related expenses

recent accounting developments share based compensation we have share based compensation plans as allowed under our long term incentive plan  or ltip 
historically  we have granted fixed stock options and deferred stock units  or dsus  to our employees under these plans 
beginning in fiscal  we granted primarily stock appreciation rights  or sars  and restricted stock  or unvested shares 
we continue to grant dsus to members of our board of directors and  beginning in  we will grant sars to our board members rather than stock options 
the terms of the sars authorized to be granted are essentially the same as our previously granted stock options 
the sars are non qualified and terminate on the seventh anniversary of the grant date 
additionally  they vest over a three year period in equal annual installments beginning on the first anniversary of the grant date and contain no post vesting restrictions other than normal trading black out periods prescribed by our corporate governance policies 
we continue to use the black scholes option pricing model to value all awards and the straight line method to amortize this fair value as compensation cost over the requisite service period 
the unvested shares vest at the end of a three year period 
during this period  holders of the unvested shares are entitled to dividend and voting rights 
the unvested shares are restricted until they vest and cannot be sold by the recipient until the restriction has lapsed at the end of the three year period 
the fair value of unvested shares is determined based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to our long term debt 
our long term debt primarily consists of borrowings under a revolving and term loan credit facilities and is primarily vulnerable to movements in the libor rate 
while we cannot predict the impact interest rate movements will have on our debt  exposure to rate changes is managed through the use of hedging activities 
our future exposure to interest rate risk is mitigated as a result of entering into an interest rate swap in fiscal on an aggregate million of debt under our term loan and four interest rate swap agreements in fiscal on an aggregate of million of debt under our revolving credit facility 
the interest rate swaps entered into during replaced the previously outstanding swaps terminated as a result of our refinancing in october at december   our outstanding swaps fixed the company s libor rate on an aggregate of million of hedged debt at rates ranging from to
