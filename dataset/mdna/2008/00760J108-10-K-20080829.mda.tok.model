overview the company was founded in to develop and manufacture burn in and test equipment for the semiconductor industry 
since its inception  the company has sold more than  systems to semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor contract assemblers and burn in and test service companies worldwide 
the company s principal products currently are the max burn in system  the advanced burn in and test system  the fox full wafer contact parallel test and burn in system and the mtx massively parallel test system  the diepak carrier and test fixtures 
the company s net sales consist primarily of sales of systems  test fixtures  die carriers  upgrades and spare parts and revenues from service contracts 
the company s selling arrangements may include contractual customer acceptance provisions and installation of the product occurs after shipment and transfer of title 
in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  corrected copy  the company recognizes revenue upon the shipment of products or the performance of services when persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company defers recognition of revenue for any amounts subject to acceptance until such acceptance occurs 
the amount of revenue deferred is the greater of the fair value of the undelivered element or the contractually agreed to amounts 
when multiple elements or deliverables exist  the company allocates the purchase price based on vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of fair value and defers revenue recognition on the undelivered portions or elements 
historically  these multiple deliverables have included items such as extended support provisions  training to be supplied after delivery of the systems  and test programs specific to customers routine applications 
the test programs can be written either by the customer  other firms or by the company 
the amount of revenue deferred in connection with an undelivered element is the greater of the fair value of the undelivered element or the contractually agreed to amount 
sales tax collected from customers is not included in revenue but rather recorded as a liability due to the respective taxing authorities 
royalty based revenue related to licensing income from performance test boards and burn in boards is recognized upon the earlier of the receipt by the company of the licensee s report related to its usage of the licensed intellectual property or upon payment by the licensee 
this revenue is recorded in net sales 
provisions for the estimated future cost of warranty and installation are recorded at the time the products are shipped 
approximately  and of our net sales for fiscal were denominated in us dollars  japanese yen and euros  respectively 
although a large percentage of net sales to european customers is denominated in us dollars  substantially all sales to japanese customers are denominated in yen 
because a substantial portion of our net sales is from sales of products for delivery outside the united states  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase the cost of our products compared to products sold by local companies in such markets 
in addition  since the price is determined at the time a purchase order is accepted  we are exposed to the risks of fluctuations in the us dollar exchange rate during the lengthy period from the date a purchase order is received until payment is made 
this exchange rate risk is partially offset to the extent our foreign operations incur expenses in the local currency 
to date  we have not invested in instruments designed to hedge currency risks 
our operating results could be adversely affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies 
the company s terms of sales with distributors are generally fob shipping point with payment due within days 
the only right of return is if the equipment does not meet the published specifications 
all products go through in house testing and verification of specifications before shipment 
apart from warranty reserves  credits issued have not been material as a percentage of net sales 
the company s distributors do not generally carry inventories of our products 
instead  the distributors place orders with the company at or about the time they receive orders from their customers 
the company s shipment terms to our distributors do not provide for credits or rights of return 
because the company s distributors do not generally carry inventories of our products  they do not have rights to price protection or to return products 
at the time the company ships products to the distributors  the price is fixed 
subsequent to the issuance of the invoice  there are no discounts or special terms 
paragraph of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  is not applicable because the company does not give the buyer the right to return the product or to receive future price concessions

in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  the company capitalizes its systems software development costs incurred after a system achieves technological feasibility and before first commercial shipment 
such costs typically represent a small portion of total research and development costs 
no system software development costs were capitalized or amortized in fiscal  or critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  long term service contracts  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements

installation of products occur after shipment and transfer of title 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sab no

the company defers recognition of revenue for any amounts subject to acceptance until such acceptance occurs 
when multiple elements exist  the company allocates the purchase price based on vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence of fair value and defers revenue recognition on the undelivered portion 
historically  these multiple deliverables have included items such as extended support provisions  training to be supplied after delivery of the systems  and test programs specific to customers routine applications 
the test programs can be written either by the customer  other firms  or the company

warranty obligations the company provides and records the estimated cost of product warranties at the time products are shipped 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
the company s estimate of warranty reserve is based on management assessment of future warranty obligations and on historical warranty obligations 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could affect how the company accounts for expenses 
inventory obsolescence in each of the last three fiscal years  the company has written down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
investment impairment the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
the company has recorded investment impairments when it believed that the investment had experienced a decline in value that was other than temporary

also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin no 
is a two step process 
the first step is recognition the company determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  the company presumes that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement

disclosures of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosures of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative commodity instruments 
the company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at may  the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company invests excess cash in a managed portfolio of corporate and government bond instruments with maturities of months or less 
the company does not use any financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
a majority of the company s revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
the company  however  enters into transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen 
substantially all sales to japanese customers are denominated in yen 
since the price is determined at the time a purchase order is accepted  the company is exposed to the risks of fluctuations in the yen us dollar exchange rate during the lengthy period from purchase order to ultimate payment 
this exchange rate risk is partially offset to the extent that the company s japanese subsidiary incurs expenses payable in yen
