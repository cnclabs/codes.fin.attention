our business is generally not seasonal in nature 
outlook for our growth strategy includes entering new niche markets in electrosurgery resulting from the development of new products anticipated in and beyond 
we anticipate that the icon gi  introduced in august  will provide the platform technology for new electrosurgical generators 
the platform will also be a significant component in the development of our new icon gs j plasma device  forecast to be completed in the second half of with continued progress in the development of bovie s meg and polarian hand held instruments  management remains optimistic that these products could significantly increase future revenues 
domestic and international marketing efforts for these product lines should commence during the current fiscal year 
collaborative discussions with larger companies could result in beneficial agreements in the manufacturing and or marketing of the instruments and other new electrosurgery entries 
our future growth potential continues to be based on carefully analyzing markets and developing products that will maximize both our opportunities and profit margins 
forecasting is admittedly a difficult task and it has always been our policy to adopt a conservative approach 
the outlook is based on a number of assumptions  which are subject to change and some of which are outside our control 
a variation in our assumptions may result in a change in this outlook

our future results of operations and the other forward looking statements contained herein  particularly the statements regarding growth in the medical products industry  capital spending  research and development  and marketing and general and administrative expenses  involve a number of risks and uncertainties

we believe that we have the product mix  facilities  personnel  competitive edge  operating cash flows and financial resources for business success in the immediate year future and distant future after year  but future revenues  costs  margins  product mix and profits are all subject to the influence of a number of factors  as discussed above 
critical accounting estimates we have adopted various accounting policies to prepare the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
our most significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  in conformity with us gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  property  plant and equipment  legal proceedings  research and development  warranty obligations  product liability  sales returns and discounts  and income taxes are updated as appropriate  which in most cases is at least quarterly 
we base our estimates on historical experience  or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates 
estimates are considered to be critical if they meet both of the following criteria the estimate requires assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made  and other materially different estimates could have been reasonably made or material changes in the estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
our critical accounting estimates include the following 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable 
we make estimates regarding the future ability of our customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends 
if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management  additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary  which would unfavorably affect future operating results 
inventory reserves we maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell our products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which we operate are highly competitive  with new products and surgical procedures introduced on an ongoing basis 
such marketplace changes may cause our products to become obsolete 
we make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would unfavorably affect future operating results 
impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets we review long lived assets which are held and used  including property and equipment and purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such evaluations compare the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its expected useful life and are significantly impacted by estimates of future prices and volumes for our products  capital needs  economic trends and other factors which are inherently difficult to forecast 
if the asset is considered to be impaired  we record an impairment charge equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
we test our goodwill for impairment  at a minimum  annually 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step of the impairment analysis compares the fair value of the goodwill to its carrying amount 
in determining fair value  the accounting guidance allows for the use of several valuation methodologies  although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
if the fair value is less than the assets carrying amount  we recognize an impairment loss equal to that excess amount 
share based compensation under the company s stock option plan  options to purchase common shares of the company may be granted to key employees  officers and directors of the company by the board of directors 
the company accounts for stock options in accordance with sfas statement r with option expense amortized over the vesting period based on the binomial lattice option pricing model fair value on the grant date  which includes a number of estimates that affect the amount of our expense 
income taxes we operate in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states 
accordingly  management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates 
because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant  we record accruals representing our best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters 
to the extent additional information becomes available  such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome
