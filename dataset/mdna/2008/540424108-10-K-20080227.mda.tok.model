cna analyzes securities on at least a quarterly basis 
part of this analysis is to monitor the length of time and severity of the decline below amortized cost for those securities in an unrealized loss position 
information on cna s otti process is set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item investments in the general account had a net unrealized gain of million at december  compared with a net unrealized gain of million at december  the unrealized position at december  was comprised of a net unrealized loss of million for fixed maturities  a net unrealized gain of million for equity securities and a net unrealized gain of million for short term securities 
the unrealized position at december  was comprised of a net unrealized gain of million for fixed maturities  a net unrealized gain of million for equity securities  and a net unrealized gain of million for short term securities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under item for further detail on the unrealized position of cna s general account investment portfolio 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments continued the following table provides the composition of fixed maturity securities available for sale in a gross unrealized loss position at december  by maturity profile

the following tables summarize the fair value and gross unrealized loss of non investment grade securities categorized by the length of time those securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position and further categorized by the severity of the unrealized loss position in increments as of december  and gross estimated fair value as a percentage of amortized cost unrealized december  fair value loss in millions fixed maturity securities non investment grade months months months greater than months total non investment grade december  fixed maturity securities non investment grade months months months greater than months total non investment grade as part of the ongoing otti monitoring process  cna evaluated the facts and circumstances based on available information for each of the non investment grade securities and determined that the securities presented in the above tables were temporarily impaired when evaluated at december  or this determination was based on a number of factors that cna regularly considers including  but not limited to the issuers ability to meet current and future interest and principal payments  an evaluation of the issuers financial condition and near term prospects  cna s assessment of the sector outlook and estimates of the fair value of any underlying collateral 
in all cases where a decline in value is judged to be temporary  cna has the intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to recover the amortized cost of its investment through an anticipated recovery in the fair value of such securities or by holding the securities to maturity 
in many cases  the securities held are matched to liabilities as part of ongoing asset liability duration management 
as such  cna continually assesses its ability to hold securities for a time sufficient to recover any temporary loss in value or until maturity 
cna believes it has sufficient levels of liquidity so as to not impact the asset liability management process 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments continued cna s equity securities classified as available for sale as of december  that were in a gross unrealized loss position had a fair value of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
under the same process as followed for fixed maturity securities  cna monitors the equity securities for other than temporary declines in value 
in all cases where a decline in value is judged to be temporary  cna has the intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to recover the cost of our investment through an anticipated recovery in the fair value of such securities 
invested assets are exposed to various risks  such as interest rate and credit risk 
due to the level of risk associated with certain invested assets and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of these assets  it is possible that changes in these risks in the near term  including increases in interest rates and further credit spread widening  could have an adverse material impact on our results of operations or equity 
within cna s overall investment portfolio   million of cna s securities are rated aaa as a result of insurance from six different mono line insurers 
insured municipal bonds are  million of this total and represent of cna s total municipal bond holdings 
the underlying average credit quality of the municipal bonds would be a without the benefit of the insurance 
should the insurance be deemed worthless  we do not believe there would be a material impact to our results of operations or financial condition 
the general account portfolio consists primarily of high quality bonds  and of which were rated as investment grade rated bbb or higher at december  and the following table summarizes the ratings of cna s general account bond portfolio at carrying value december in millions of dollars us government and affiliated agency securities other aaa rated aa and a rated bbb rated non investment grade total at december  and  approximately and of the general account portfolio was issued by us government and affiliated agencies or was rated by s p or moody s

the remaining bonds were rated by other rating agencies or cna 
non investment grade bonds  as presented in the tables above  are high yield securities rated below bbb by bond rating agencies  as well as other unrated securities that  according to cna s analysis  are below investment grade 
high yield securities generally involve a greater degree of risk than investment grade securities 
however  expected returns item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments continued should compensate for the added risk 
this risk is also considered in the interest rate assumptions for the underlying insurance products 
the carrying value of securities that are either subject to trading restrictions or trade in illiquid private placement markets at december  was million  which represents of cna s total investment portfolio

of the securities with sub prime exposure  approximately were rated as investment grade  while of the alt a securities were rated investment grade 
in addition to sub prime exposure in fixed maturity securities  there is exposure of approximately million through other investments  including limited partnerships 
the company has mitigated a portion of its sub prime exposure through an economic hedge position in credit default swaps cds from which it recognized net gains of million for the year ended december  all available for sale asset backed securities in an unrealized loss position are reviewed as part of the ongoing otti process and resulted in otti losses of million for the year ended december  included in this otti loss was million related to securities with sub prime and alt a exposure 
the company s review of these securities includes an analysis of cash flow modeling under various default scenarios  the seniority of the specific tranche within the deal structure  the composition of the collateral and the actual default experience 
given current market conditions and the specific facts and circumstances related to the company s individual sub prime and alt a exposures  the company believes that all remaining unrealized losses are temporary in nature 
continued deterioration in these markets beyond current expectations may cause the company to reconsider and record additional otti losses 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations accounting standards in september of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
retains the exchange price notion in the definition of fair value and clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the market in which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability 
sfas no 
emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement and the fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
sfas no 
expands disclosures surrounding the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities and specifically focuses on the sources used to measure fair value 
in instances of recurring use of fair value measures using unobservable inputs  sfas no 
requires separate disclosure of the effect on earnings for the period 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  a one year deferral has been granted for the implementation of sfas no 
for other nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and equity 
in february of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
generally accepted accounting principles have required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings 
sfas no 
helps to mitigate volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations and equity 
in december of  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
this standard will improve  simplify  and converge internationally the reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
requires all entities to report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries in the same way as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
moreover  sfas no 
requires that transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests be treated as equity transactions 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  as a result  after january   the company s deferred gains related to the issuances of boardwalk pipeline common units million at december  will be recognized in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets as opposed to the consolidated statements of income

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are a large diversified financial services company 
as such  we and our subsidiaries have significant amounts of financial instruments that involve market risk 
our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments 
changes in the trading portfolio are recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at december  assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
we believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management 
senior management approves our overall investment strategy and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy with an acceptable level of risk 
we may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions 
interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
we attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing instruments such as interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  commitments to purchase securities  options  futures and forwards 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on shareholders equity 
the analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period 
the sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on december  and due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points  with all other variables held constant 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
accordingly  the analysis may not be indicative of  is not intended to provide  and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes of market interest rates on our earnings or shareholders equity 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
our debt is denominated in us dollars and has been primarily issued at fixed rates  therefore  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the impact of a basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of million and million at december  and respectively 
highmount has entered into interest rate swaps for a notional amount of billion to hedge its exposure to fluctuations in libor 
these swaps effectively fix the interest rate at 
gains or losses from derivative instruments used for hedging purposes  to the extent realized  will generally be offset by recognition of the hedged transaction 
equity price risk we have exposure to equity price risk as a result of our investment in equity securities and equity derivatives 
equity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of equity prices which affect the value of equity securities or instruments that derive their value from such securities or indexes 
equity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous decrease in the underlying reference price or index from its level at december  and  with all other variables held constant 
foreign exchange rate risk foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
we have foreign exchange rate exposure when we buy or sell foreign currencies or financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency 
this exposure is mitigated by our asset liability matching strategy and through the use of futures for those instruments which are not matched 
our foreign transactions are primarily denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars  british pounds  japanese yen and the european monetary unit 
the sensitivity analysis assumes an instantaneous decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar from their levels at december  and  with all other variables held constant 
commodity price risk we have exposure to price risk as a result of our investments in commodities 
commodity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of commodity prices that impact instruments which derive their value from such commodities 
commodity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous increase in commodity prices of from their levels at december  and the impact of a change in commodity prices on highmount s non trading commodity based financial derivative instruments at a point in time is not necessarily representative of the results that will be realized when such contracts are ultimately settled 
net losses from commodity derivative instruments used for hedging purposes  to the extent realized  will generally be offset by recognition of the underlying hedged transaction  such as revenue from sales 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk credit risk we are exposed to credit risk which relates to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations 
boardwalk pipeline has exposure related to receivables for services provided  as well as volumes owed by customers for imbalances or gas lent by boardwalk pipeline to them generally under parking and lending services and no notice services 
boardwalk pipeline maintains credit policies intended to minimize this risk and actively monitors these policies 
natural gas price volatility has increased dramatically in recent years  which has materially increased boardwalk pipeline s credit risk related to gas loaned to its customers 
as of december   the amount of gas loaned out was approximately trillion british thermal units tbtu and  assuming an average market price during december of per million british thermal units mmbtu  the market value of gas loaned out at december  would have been approximately million 
if any significant customer should have credit or financial problems resulting in a delay or failure to repay the gas it owes boardwalk pipeline  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the following tables present our market risk by category equity markets  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices on the basis of those entered into for trading purposes and other than trading purposes

adverse changes on options which differ from those presented above would not necessarily result in a proportionate change to the estimated market risk exposure 
a a decrease in equity prices of would result in market risk amounting to and at december  and  respectively
