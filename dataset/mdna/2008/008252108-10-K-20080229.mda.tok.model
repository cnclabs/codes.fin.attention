overview we are an asset management company with equity investments in a diverse group of boutique investment management firms our affiliates 
we pursue a growth strategy designed to generate shareholder value through the internal growth of our existing business  additional investments in boutique investment management firms and strategic transactions and relationships designed to enhance our affiliates businesses and growth prospects 
through our affiliates  we manage approximately billion in assets as of december  in more than investment products across a broad range of asset classes and investment styles in three principal distribution channels mutual fund  institutional and high net worth 
we believe that our diversification across asset classes  investment styles and distribution channels helps to mitigate our exposure to the risks created by changing market environments 
the following summarizes our operations in our three principal distribution channels 
our affiliates provide advisory or sub advisory services to more than mutual funds 
these funds are distributed to retail and institutional clients directly and through intermediaries  including independent investment advisors  retirement plan sponsors  broker dealers  major fund marketplaces and bank trust departments 
in the institutional distribution channel  our affiliates offer approximately investment products across approximately different investment styles  including small  small mid  mid and large capitalization value  growth equity and emerging markets 
in addition  our affiliates offer quantitative  alternative  credit arbitrage and fixed income products 
through this distribution channel  our affiliates manage assets for foundations and endowments  defined benefit and defined contribution plans for corporations and municipalities  and taft hartley plans  with disciplined and focused investment styles that address the specialized needs of institutional clients 
the high net worth distribution channel is comprised broadly of two principal client groups 
the first group consists principally of direct relationships with high net worth individuals and families and charitable foundations 
for these clients  our affiliates provide investment management or customized investment counseling and fiduciary services 
the second group consists of individual managed account client relationships established through intermediaries  generally brokerage firms or other sponsors 
our affiliates provide investment management services through more than managed account and wrap programs 
in  we enhanced the diversity of our product offerings across these channels through investments in two alternative investment managers in november  we acquired a minority interest in valueact capital valueact  a san francisco based investment firm that establishes ownership interests in undervalued companies and works with each company s management and board of directors to implement business strategies that enhance shareholder value 
valueact has over clients  including endowments  foundations  corporations  family offices  high net worth investors and funds of funds 
in december  we acquired a minority interest in bluemountain capital management bluemountain  a leading global credit alternatives manager specializing in relative value strategies in the corporate loan  bond  credit and equity derivatives markets 
bluemountain has offices in new york and london  and manages assets on behalf of predominantly institutional and high net worth clients 
we operate our business through our affiliates in our three principal distribution channels  maintaining each affiliate s distinct entrepreneurial culture and independence through our investment structure 
in each case  our affiliates are organized as separate firms  and their operating or shareholder agreements are tailored to provide appropriate incentives for our affiliate management owners and to address the particular characteristics of that affiliate while enabling us to protect our interests 
in making investments in boutique asset management firms  we seek to partner with the highest quality firms in the industry  with outstanding management teams  strong long term performance records and a demonstrated commitment to continued growth and success 
fundamental to our investment approach is the belief that affiliate management equity ownership along with amg s ownership aligns our interests and provides affiliate managers with a powerful incentive to continue to grow their business 
our investment structure provides a degree of liquidity and diversification to principal owners of boutique investment management firms  while at the same time expanding equity ownership opportunities among the firm s management and allowing management to continue to participate in the firm s future growth 
our partnership approach also ensures that affiliates maintain operational autonomy in managing their business  thereby preserving their firm s entrepreneurial culture and independence 
although the specific structure of each investment is highly tailored to meet the needs of a particular affiliate  in all cases  amg establishes a meaningful equity interest in the firm  with the remaining equity interests retained by the management of the affiliate 
each affiliate is organized as a separate firm  and its operating or shareholder agreement is structured to provide appropriate incentives for affiliate management owners and to address the affiliate s particular characteristics while also enabling us to protect our interests  including through arrangements such as long term employment agreements with key members of the firm s management team 
in most cases  we own a majority of the equity interests of a firm and structure a revenue sharing arrangement  in which a percentage of revenue is allocated for use by management of that affiliate in paying operating expenses of the affiliate  including salaries and bonuses 
we call this the operating allocation 
the portion of the affiliate s revenue that is allocated to the owners of that affiliate including us is called the owners allocation 
each affiliate allocates its owners allocation to its managers and to us generally in proportion to their and our respective ownership interests in that affiliate 
one of the purposes of our revenue sharing arrangements is to provide ongoing incentives for affiliate managers by allowing them to participate in the growth of their firm s revenue  which may increase their compensation from both the operating allocation and the owners allocation 
these arrangements also provide incentives to control operating expenses  thereby increasing the portion of the operating allocation that is available for growth initiatives and compensation 
an affiliate s operating allocation is structured to cover its operating expenses 
however  should actual operating expenses exceed the operating allocation  our contractual share of cash under the owners allocation generally has priority over the allocations and distributions to the affiliate s managers 
as a result  the excess expenses first reduce the portion of the owners allocation allocated to the affiliate s managers until that portion is eliminated  before reducing the portion allocated to us 
any such reduction in our portion of the owners allocation is required to be paid back to us out of the portion of future owners allocation allocated to the affiliate s managers 
our minority investments are also structured to align our interests with those of the affiliate s management through shared equity ownership  as well as to preserve the affiliate s entrepreneurial culture and independence by maintaining the affiliate s operational autonomy 
in cases where we hold a minority interest  the revenue sharing arrangement generally allocates a percentage of the affiliate s revenue 
the remaining revenue is used to pay operating expenses and profit distributions to the other owners 
certain of our affiliates operate under profit based arrangements through which we own a majority of the equity in the firm and receive a share of profits as cash flow  rather than a percentage of revenue through a typical revenue sharing agreement 
as a result  we participate fully in any increase or decrease in the revenue or expenses of such firms 
in these cases  we participate in a budgeting process and generally provide incentives to management through compensation arrangements based on the performance of the affiliate 
we are focused on establishing and maintaining long term partnerships with our affiliates 
our shared equity ownership gives both amg and our affiliate partners meaningful incentives to manage their businesses for strong future growth 
from time to time  we may consider changes to the structure of our relationship with an affiliate in order to better support the firm s growth strategy 
through our affiliated investment management firms  we derive most of our revenue from the provision of investment management services 
investment management fees asset based fees are usually determined as a percentage fee charged on periodic values of a client s assets under management  most asset based advisory fees are billed by our affiliates quarterly 
certain clients are billed for all or a portion of their accounts based upon assets under management valued at the beginning of a billing period in advance 
other clients are billed for all or a portion of their accounts based upon assets under management valued at the end of the billing period in arrears 
most client accounts in the high net worth distribution channel are billed in advance  and most client accounts in the institutional distribution channel are billed in arrears 
clients in the mutual fund distribution channel are billed based upon average daily assets under management 
advisory fees billed in advance will not reflect subsequent changes in the market value of assets under management for that period but may reflect changes due to client withdrawals 
conversely  advisory fees billed in arrears will reflect changes in the market value of assets under management for that period 
in addition  over affiliate alternative investment and equity products  representing approximately billion of assets under management as of december   also bill on the basis of absolute or relative investment performance performance fees 
these products  which are primarily in the institutional distribution channel  are often structured to have returns that are not directly correlated to changes in broader equity indices and  if earned  the performance fee component is typically billed less frequently than an asset based fee 
although performance fees inherently depend on investment results and will vary from period to period  we anticipate performance fees to be a recurring component of our revenue 
we also anticipate that  within any calendar year  the majority of performance fees will typically be realized in the fourth quarter 
for certain of our affiliates  generally where we own a minority interest  we are required to use the equity method of accounting 
consistent with this method  we have not consolidated the operating results of these firms including their revenue in our consolidated statements of income 
our share of these firms profits net of intangible amortization is reported in income from equity method investments  and is therefore reflected in our net income and ebitda 
as a consequence  increases or decreases in these firms assets under management which totaled billion as of december  will not affect reported revenue in the same manner as changes in assets under management at our other affiliates 
our recent investments in valueact and bluemountain are both accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
our net income reflects the revenue of our consolidated affiliates and our share of income from affiliates which we account for under the equity method  reduced by our expenses  including the operating expenses of our consolidated affiliates  and the profits allocated to managers of our consolidated affiliates ie  minority interest 
as discussed above  for consolidated affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  the operating expenses of the affiliate as well as its managers minority interest generally increase or decrease as the affiliate s revenue increases or decreases because of the direct relationship established in many of our agreements between the affiliate s revenue and its operating allocation and owners allocation 
at our consolidated profit based affiliates  expenses may or may not correspond to increases or decreases in the affiliates revenues 
our level of profitability will depend on a variety of factors  including those affecting the global financial markets generally and the equity markets particularly  which could potentially result in considerable increases or decreases in the assets under management at our affiliates  the level of affiliate revenue  which is dependent on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain or increase assets under management by maintaining their existing investment advisory relationships and fee structures  marketing their services successfully to new clients and obtaining favorable investment results  our receipt of owners allocation from affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  which depends on the ability of our existing and future affiliates to maintain certain levels of operating profit margins  the increases or decreases in the revenue and expenses of affiliates that operate on a profit based model  the availability and cost of the capital with which we finance our existing and new investments  our success in making new investments and the terms upon which such transactions are completed  the level of intangible assets and the associated amortization expense resulting from our investments  the level of our expenses  including compensation for our employees  and the level of taxation to which we are subject 
results of operations the following tables present our affiliates reported assets under management by operating segment which are also referred to as distribution channels in this annual report on form k

in  we completed a new affiliate investment in chicago equity partners 
in  we completed new investments in valueact and bluemountain 
we transferred our interests in certain affiliated investment management firms in each of the periods presented 
additionally  during  we reclassified billion and billion of existing assets under management to the mutual fund and institutional distribution channels  respectively  from the high net worth distribution channel 
these changes were not material to our financial position or results of operations 
the operating segment analysis presented in the following table is based on average assets under management 
for the mutual fund distribution channel  average assets under management generally represent an average of the daily net assets under management 
for the institutional and high net worth distribution channels  average assets under management represents an average of the assets at the beginning and end of each calendar quarter during the applicable period 
we believe that this analysis more closely correlates to the billing cycle of each distribution channel and  as such  provides a more meaningful relationship to revenue

average assets under management includes assets managed by affiliated investment management firms that we do not consolidate for financial reporting purposes of billion  billion and billion for  and  respectively 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the basis of presentation of the financial results of our three operating segments 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are required to use the equity method of accounting for certain investments and as such do not consolidate their revenue for financial reporting purposes 
our share of profits from these investments is reported in income from equity method investments and is therefore reflected in net income and ebitda 
the definition of ebitda and our reasons for using ebitda are presented in note on page our use of ebitda  including a reconciliation to cash flow from operations  is discussed in greater detail in liquidity and capital resources 
revenue our revenue is generally determined by the level of our assets under management  the portion of our assets across our products and three operating segments  which realize different fee rates  and the recognition of any performance fees 
our revenue increased million or in from  primarily as a result of a increase in average assets under management 
the increase in average assets under management resulted principally from positive investment performance in and  net client cash flows in and  to a lesser extent  our investment in a new affiliate 
the increase in revenue was proportionately less than the growth in assets under management primarily as a result of our equity method investments  as we do not consolidate the revenue or expenses of these affiliates

the increase in revenue was proportionately less than the increase in assets under management primarily as a result of our equity method investments  as we do not consolidate the revenue or expenses of these affiliates  and increases in assets under management that realize a comparatively lower fee rate 
operating expenses the following table summarizes our consolidated operating expenses change change in millions compensation and related expenses selling  general and administrative amortization of intangible assets depreciation and other amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses the substantial portion of our operating expenses is incurred by our affiliates  the majority of which is incurred by affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements 
for affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  an affiliate s operating allocation percentage generally determines its operating expenses 
accordingly  our compensation expense is generally impacted by increases or decreases in each affiliate s revenue and the corresponding increases or decreases in their respective operating allocations 
during  approximately million  or about of our consolidated compensation expense  was attributable to our affiliate managers 
the percentage of revenue allocated to operating expenses varies from one affiliate to another and may vary within an affiliate depending on the source or amount of revenue 
as a result  changes in our aggregate revenue may not impact our consolidated operating expenses to the same degree 
compensation and related expenses increased in and in these increases were primarily a result of the relationship between revenue and operating expenses at our affiliates with revenue sharing arrangements  which experienced aggregate increases in revenue and accordingly  reported higher compensation expense 
the increases were also related to increases in aggregate affiliate expenses from our new investments million in and million in 
in  the increase in compensation was proportionately greater than the increase in revenue because of an increase in revenue at affiliates with higher operating allocations 
unrelated to the changes in revenue  the increase in was also attributable to a million increase in share based compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in and in  principally as a result of the growth in assets under management at our affiliates in the mutual fund distribution channel 
selling  general and administrative expenses also increased in as a result of million of expenses related to our global distribution initiatives 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in aggregate affiliate expenses from the transfer of our interests in certain affiliates during and amortization of intangible assets increased in and in  principally from an increase in definite lived intangible assets resulting from our investments in new and existing affiliates during and depreciation and other amortization increased in and in these increases were principally attributable to spending on depreciable assets in recent periods 
the increase in was also attributable to our investments in new affiliates 
other operating expenses decreased in principally as a result of benefits realized upon the transfer of affiliate interests during as well as a million recovery of affiliate expenses that previously reduced our share of owners allocation 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in aggregate affiliate expenses from our investment in chicago equity partners 
other operating expenses increased in principally as a result of a million increase in operating expenses from our new investments in and expenses related to other affiliate transactions 
other income statement data the following table summarizes non operating income and expense data change change in millions income from equity method investments investment and other income investment income from affiliate investments in partnerships minority interest in affiliate investments in partnerships minority interest interest expense income tax expense income from equity method investments consists of our share of income from affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting  net of any related intangible amortization 
income from equity method investments increased in and in principally as a result of increases in assets under management and revenue attributable to affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting  including investments in our new affiliates 
investment and other income primarily consists of earnings on cash and cash equivalent balances and earnings that affiliates realize on investments in marketable securities 
investment and other income increased in and in the increase in resulted principally from an increase in affiliate investment earnings of million  and earnings of million on investments held by new affiliates 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  investment income from affiliate investments in partnerships and minority interest in affiliate investments in partnerships relate to the consolidation of certain investment partnerships in which our affiliates serve as the general partner 
for and  the income from affiliate investments in partnerships was million and million  respectively  which was principally attributable to investors who are unrelated to us 
minority interest increased in and in  principally as a result of the previously discussed increases in revenue 
in  the increase was proportionately greater than the increase in revenue because certain affiliates reported expenses that were less than their operating allocation  resulting in higher profits attributable to our affiliate management partners 
in  these affiliates reported expenses that were equal to their operating allocation 
interest expense increased in  principally from borrowings under our senior credit facility million in  the october issuance of million of junior convertible trust preferred securities million in and the april issuance of million of junior convertible trust preferred securities million in 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense from the repayment of our senior notes due the increase in was principally attributable to the million junior convertible trust preferred securities million in and increases in borrowings under our senior credit facility million in 
income taxes increased in and principally as a result of the increases in net income before taxes of and  respectively 
the increase in was partially offset by a million reduction in income taxes from a decrease in canadian federal income tax rates  which reduction did not recur in net income the following table summarizes net income for the past three years change change in millions net income net income increased in and in  principally as a result of increases in revenue and income from equity method investments  partially offset by increases in reported operating  interest  minority interest and tax expenses  as described above 
supplemental performance measure as supplemental information  we provide a non gaap performance measure that we refer to as cash net income 
this measure is provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  net income 
cash net income is defined as net income plus amortization and deferred taxes related to intangible assets plus affiliate depreciation 
we consider cash net income an important measure of our financial performance  as we believe it best represents operating performance before non cash expenses relating to our acquisition of interests in our affiliates 
cash net income is used by our management and board of directors as a principal performance benchmark  including as a measure for aligning executive compensation with stockholder value 
since our acquired assets do not generally depreciate or require replacement by us  and since they generate deferred tax expenses that are unlikely to reverse  we add back these non cash expenses to net income to measure operating performance 
we add back amortization attributable to acquired client relationships because this expense does not correspond to the changes in value of these assets  which do not diminish predictably over time 
the portion of deferred taxes generally attributable to intangible assets including goodwill that we no longer amortize but which continues to generate tax deductions is added back  because these accruals would be used only in the event of a future sale of an affiliate or an impairment charge  which we consider unlikely 
we add back the portion of consolidated depreciation expense incurred by our affiliates because under our affiliates operating agreements we are generally not required to replenish these depreciating assets 
conversely  we do not add back the deferred taxes relating to our floating rate senior convertible securities or other depreciation expenses 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net income to cash net income in millions net income intangible amortization intangible amortization equity method investments intangible related deferred taxes affiliate depreciation cash net income as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we are required to use the equity method of accounting for our investments in aqr  beutel  deans knight  valueact and bluemountain and  as such  do not consolidate their revenue or expenses including intangible amortization expenses in our income statement 
our share of these investments amortization is reported in income from equity method investments 
cash net income increased in and in  primarily as a result of the previously described factors affecting net income 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes certain key financial data relating to our liquidity and capital resources december  in millions balance sheet data cash and cash equivalents senior debt zero coupon convertible notes floating rate convertible securities mandatory convertible securities junior convertible trust preferred securities cash flow data operating cash flows investing cash flows financing cash flows ebitda the definition of ebitda is presented in note on page we view our ratio of debt to ebitda our leverage ratio as an important gauge of our ability to service debt  make new investments and access capital 
consistent with industry practice  we do not consider our mandatory convertible securities or our junior convertible trust preferred securities as debt for the purpose of determining our leverage ratio 
we also view our leverage on a net debt basis by deducting our cash and cash equivalents from our debt balance 
the leverage covenant of our senior credit facility is generally consistent with our treatment of our mandatory convertible securities and our junior convertible trust preferred securities and our net debt approach 
as of december   our leverage ratio was supplemental liquidity measure as supplemental information  we provide information regarding our ebitda  a non gaap liquidity measure 
this measure is provided in addition to  but not as a substitute for  cash flow from operations 
ebitda represents earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda  as calculated by us  may not be consistent with computations of ebitda by other companies 
as a measure of liquidity  we believe that ebitda is useful as an indicator of our ability to service debt  make new investments and meet working capital requirements 
we further believe that many investors use this information when analyzing the financial position of companies in the investment management industry 
the following table provides a reconciliation of cash flow from operations to ebitda in millions cash flow from operations interest expense  net of non cash items current tax provision income from equity method investments  net of distributions changes in assets and liabilities and other adjustments ebitda non cash items represent amortization of issuance costs and interest accretion  and million in  and  respectively 
distributions from equity method investments were  and million for  and  respectively 
other adjustments include stock option expenses  tax benefits from stock options and other adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash flow from operating activities 
the definition of ebitda is presented in note on page in  we met our cash requirements primarily through cash generated by operating activities  the issuance of convertible securities and borrowings of senior debt 
our principal uses of cash were to repurchase shares of our common stock  make investments in new and existing affiliates  repay senior debt and make distributions to affiliate managers 
we expect that our principal uses of cash for the foreseeable future will be for investments in new and existing affiliates  distributions to affiliate managers  payment of principal and interest on outstanding debt  the repurchase of debt securities  the repurchase of shares of our common stock and for working capital purposes 
senior credit facility on november   we entered into an amended and restated senior credit facility the facility 
the facility allows us to borrow an aggregate of million 
the facility is comprised of a million revolving credit facility the revolver and a million term loan the term loan 
we pay interest on these obligations at specified rates based either on the eurodollar rate or the prime rate as in effect from time to time that vary depending on our credit rating 
the term loan requires principal payments to be made at specified dates until maturity 
subject to the agreement of lenders to provide additional commitments  we have the option to increase the facility by up to an additional million 
the facility will mature in february  and contains financial covenants with respect to leverage and interest coverage 
the facility also contains customary affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on indebtedness  liens  cash dividends and fundamental corporate changes 
borrowings under the facility are collateralized by pledges of the substantial majority of our capital stock or other equity interests owned by us 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our facility 
zero coupon senior convertible notes in  we issued million principal amount at maturity of zero coupon senior convertible notes due zero coupon convertible notes  with each note issued at of such principal amount and accreting at a rate of per year 
as of december   million principal amount at maturity remain outstanding 
each security is convertible into shares of our common stock at a current base conversion price of upon the occurrence of certain events  including the following i if the closing price of a share of our common stock is more than a specified price over certain periods initially and increasing incrementally at the end of each calendar quarter to in april  ii if the credit rating assigned by standard poor s to the securities is below bb  or iii if we call the securities for redemption 
the holders may require us to repurchase the securities at their accreted value in may and if the holders exercise this option in the future  we may elect to repurchase the securities with cash  shares of our common stock or some combination thereof 
we have the option to redeem the securities for cash at their accreted value 
under the terms of the indenture governing the zero coupon convertible notes  a holder may convert such security into common stock by following the conversion procedures in the indenture  subject to changes in the price of our common stock  the zero coupon convertible notes may not be convertible in certain future periods 
in  we amended the zero coupon convertible notes 
under the terms of this amendment  we will pay interest through may  at a rate of per year on the principal amount at maturity of the notes in addition to the accrual of the original issue discount 
floating rate senior convertible securities in  we issued million of floating rate senior convertible securities due floating rate convertible securities bearing interest at a rate equal to month libor minus  payable in cash quarterly 
in the first quarter of  we called the outstanding floating rate convertible securities for redemption at their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
in lieu of redemption  substantially all of the holders elected to convert their securities 
pursuant to these conversions and other privately negotiated exchanges  we will issue approximately million shares of common stock and all of our floating rate convertible securities will be cancelled and retired 
the floating rate senior convertible securities are considered contingent payment debt instruments under federal income tax regulations 
these regulations required us to deduct interest in an amount greater than our reported interest expense  and resulted in annual deferred taxes of approximately million 
because the trading price of our common stock exceeded at the time of the conversions described above  million of deferred tax liabilities attributable to these securities will be reclassified to stockholders equity in the first quarter of mandatory convertible securities in  we issued million of mandatory convertible securities prides  each unit consisting of i a senior note due february with a principal amount of  per note  with interest payable quarterly at the annual rate of  and ii a forward equity purchase contract pursuant to which the holder agreed to purchase shares of our common stock in february the holders obligations under the forward equity purchase contracts were collateralized by the pledge to us of the senior notes 
in the first quarter of  we repurchased the outstanding senior notes component of our prides 
the repurchase proceeds were used by the original holders to fulfill their obligations under the related forward equity purchase contracts 
pursuant to the settlement of the forward equity purchase contracts and other privately negotiated exchanges  we have issued approximately million shares of common stock 
all of our prides have been cancelled and retired 
junior convertible trust preferred securities in  we issued million of junior subordinated convertible debentures due to a wholly owned trust simultaneous with the issuance  by the trust  of million of convertible trust preferred securities to investors 
the junior subordinated convertible debentures and convertible trust preferred securities together  the junior convertible trust preferred securities have substantially the same terms 
the junior convertible trust preferred securities bear interest at per annum  payable quarterly in cash 
each security is convertible  at any time  into shares of our common stock  which represents a conversion price of per share or a premium to the then prevailing share price of 
upon conversion  investors will receive cash or shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and common stock at our election 
the junior convertible trust preferred securities may not be redeemed by us prior to april  on or after april   they may be redeemed if the closing price of our common stock exceeds per share for a specified period of time 
the trust s only assets are the junior convertible subordinated debentures 
to the extent that the trust has available funds  we are obligated to ensure that holders of the junior convertible trust preferred securities receive all payments due from the trust

the trust s only assets are the junior convertible subordinated debentures 
to the extent that the trust has available funds  we are obligated to ensure that holders of the junior convertible trust preferred securities receive all payments due from the trust 
the and junior convertible trust preferred securities are considered contingent payment debt instruments under the federal income tax regulations 
we are required to deduct interest in an amount greater than our reported interest expense 
in  these deductions will generate deferred taxes of approximately million 
call spread option agreements in  we entered into a series of contracts that provided the option  but not the obligation  to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock at a weighted average price of per share at specified times 
upon exercise  we could elect to receive the intrinsic value of a contract in cash or common stock 
during  we exercised  options with a total intrinsic value of million 
we elected to receive approximately  shares of common stock and used the remaining proceeds million to enter into another series of contracts that provide the option  but not the obligation  to repurchase up to  shares of its common stock at a weighted average price of per share 
these options may be exercised or will expire during the first quarter of forward purchase contract in october  we entered into a prepaid forward purchase contract  pursuant to which we purchased  shares of common stock for approximately million 
we have the option to settle the forward purchase contract on or before october  purchases of affiliate equity many of our affiliate operating agreements provide our affiliate managers the conditional right to require us to purchase their retained equity interests at certain intervals 
these agreements also provide us a conditional right to require affiliate managers to sell their retained equity interests to us upon their death  permanent incapacity or termination of employment and provide affiliate managers a conditional right to require us to purchase such retained equity interests upon the occurrence of specified events 
these purchases may occur in varying amounts over a period of approximately years or longer  and the actual timing and amounts of such purchases or the actual occurrence of such purchases generally cannot be predicted with any certainty 
these purchases are generally calculated based upon a multiple of the affiliate s cash flow distributions at the time the right is exercised  which is intended to represent fair value 
as one measure of the potential magnitude of such purchases  in the event that a triggering event and resulting purchase occurred with respect to all such retained equity interests as of december   the aggregate amount of these payments would have totaled approximately  million 
in the event that all such transactions were consummated  we would own the cash flow distributions attributable to the additional equity interests purchased from our affiliate managers 
as of december   this amount would represent approximately million on an annualized basis 
we may pay for these purchases in cash  shares of our common stock or other forms of consideration 
affiliate management partners are also permitted to sell their equity interests to other individuals or entities in certain cases  subject to our approval or other restrictions 
these potential purchases  combined with our other cash needs  may require more cash than is available from operations  and therefore  we may need to raise capital by making borrowings under our facility  by selling shares of our common stock or other equity or debt securities  or to otherwise refinance a portion of these purchases 
operating cash flow cash flow from operations generally represents net income plus non cash charges for amortization  deferred taxes  equity based compensation and depreciation  as well as increases and decreases in our consolidated working capital 
the increase in cash flow from operations in as compared to resulted principally from increased net income of million and increased minority interest of million  partially offset by a million increase in payments of liabilities 
the increase in cash flow from operations for the year ended as compared to resulted principally from increased net income of million and increased net distributions from our equity method investments of million  partially offset by a decrease in minority interest of million 
in accordance with eitf  we consolidated and million of client assets held in partnerships controlled by our affiliates as of december  and  respectively 
sales of client assets generated and million of operating cash flow in and  respectively 
investing cash flow changes in net cash flow used in investing activities result primarily from our investments in new and existing affiliates 
net cash flow used to make investments was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these investments were funded with borrowings under our senior credit facility and existing cash 
the increase in net cash flows used in investing activities in was partially offset by decreased purchases by our affiliates in investment securities 
we may make payments in connection with our future investments 
we are also contingently liable  upon achievement of specified financial targets  to make additional purchase payments of up to million through the specified financial targets for certain agreements are measured beginning december   and we expect we will make payments of up to million in financing cash flow net cash flows from financing activities increased million in as compared to  primarily as a result of our million issuance of junior convertible trust preferred securities and a net increase in borrowings under our revolver of million  partially offset by million of repurchases of our common stock 
the decrease in cash flows used in financing activities in from was primarily as a result of million of repurchases of our common stock  a use of cash that was financed by our million issuance of junior convertible trust preferred securities and a net increase of borrowings under our facility of million 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r  beginning in  certain tax benefits associated with stock options have been reported as financing cash flows in the amount of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
as more fully discussed in liquidity and capital resources  in the first quarter of we retired million of our prides and will retire million of floating rate convertible securities principally through the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due contractual obligations total thereafter in millions senior debt senior convertible securities mandatory convertible securities junior convertible trust preferred securities  purchases of affiliate equity  leases other liabilities total    the timing of debt payments assumes that outstanding debt is settled for cash or common stock at the applicable maturity dates 
the amounts include the cash payment of fixed interest 
in the first quarter of  we will issue approximately million shares of our common stock in connection with conversions and privately negotiated exchanges of our floating rate convertible securities 
following consummation of these transactions  all of our floating rate convertible securities will be cancelled and retired and no further obligations will remain with respect thereto 
as more fully discussed on page  consistent with industry practice  we do not consider our mandatory convertible securities or our junior convertible trust preferred securities as debt for the purpose of determining our leverage ratio 
in the first quarter of  we issued approximately million shares of common stock in connection with privately negotiated exchanges of our mandatory convertible securities and the settlement of the forward equity purchase contracts by holders of these securities 
all of our mandatory convertible securities have been cancelled and retired and no further obligations remain with respect thereto 
purchases of affiliate equity reflect our estimates of conditional purchases of additional equity in our affiliates and assume that all conditions to such purchases are met and that such purchases will all be effected on the date that they are exercisable 
as described previously  these purchases may occur in varying amounts over the next years or longer  and the actual timing and amounts of such purchases or the actual occurrence of such purchases generally cannot be predicted with any certainty 
additionally  in many instances we have the discretion to settle these purchases with our common stock and in all cases can consent to the transfer of these interests to other individuals or entities 
as one measure of the potential magnitude of such purchases  assuming that all such purchases had been effected as of december   the aggregate purchase amount would have totaled approximately  million 
assuming the closing of such additional purchases  we would own the prospective cash flow distributions associated with all additional equity so purchased  estimated to be approximately million on an annualized basis as of december  other liabilities reflect amounts payable to affiliate managers related to our purchase of additional affiliate equity interests 
this table does not include liabilities for uncertain tax positions million as of december  as we cannot predict when such liabilities will be paid 
market risk our revenue is derived primarily from fees which are based on the market values of assets under management 
such values are affected by changes in financial markets  and accordingly declines in the financial markets will negatively impact our revenue and net income 
the broader financial markets are affected  in part  by changing interest rates 
we cannot predict the effects that interest rates or changes in interest rates may have on either the broader financial markets or our affiliates assets under management and associated fees 
we pay a variable rate of interest on our senior credit facility million outstanding as of december  and  until february  have paid a variable rate of interest on our floating rate senior convertible securities 
we have fixed rates of interest on our zero coupon senior convertible notes and on both of our junior convertible trust preferred securities 
we have also paid fixed rates of interest on the senior notes component of our prides 
from time to time  we seek to manage our exposure to changing interest rates by entering into interest rate hedging contracts 
for example  through february  we were a party to interest rate hedging contracts with a million notional amount  which fixed the interest rate on a portion of our floating rate senior convertible securities to a weighted average interest rate of approximately for the period from february to february as of december   the unrealized gain on these contracts as of december  was million 
we estimate that a basis point change in interest rates would result in a net annual change to interest expense related to our variable rate borrowings of approximately million 
while a change in market interest rates would not affect the interest expense incurred on our fixed rate securities  such a change may affect the fair value of these securities 
we estimate that a basis point change in interest rates would result in a net change in the value of our fixed rate securities of approximately million 
we estimate that a basis point change in interest rates would result in a net change in the unrealized value of our current hedging contracts of approximately million 
there can be no assurance that our hedging contracts will meet their overall objective of reducing our interest expense or that we will be successful in obtaining hedging contracts in the future on our existing or any new indebtedness 
we operate primarily in the united states  and accordingly most of our consolidated revenue and associated expenses are denominated in us dollars 
we also provide services and earn revenue outside of the united states  therefore  the portion of our revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies may be impacted by movements in currency exchange rates 
the valuations of our foreign affiliates are impacted by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  which could be recorded as a component of stockholders equity 
to illustrate the effect of possible changes in currency exchange rates  as of december   we estimate that a change in the canadian dollar to us dollar exchange rate would result in approximately a million change to stockholders equity and a million change to income before income taxes 
during  changes in currency exchange rates increased stockholders equity by million 
recent accounting developments in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements fas 
fas establishes a framework for measuring fair value applicable to other accounting standards that use fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which deferred the effective date of fas for one year for nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we will be subject to certain of the provisions of fas in the first quarter of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements  but will require certain additional disclosures 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas 
fas permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
we will adopt fas in the first quarter of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  business combinations fas r 
fas r will change the accounting for business combinations in a number of respects  including the way entities account for business combinations achieved in stages by requiring the identifiable assets and liabilities to be measured at their full fair values on the acquisition date 
in addition  fas r will change the treatment of contingent consideration  contingencies  acquisition costs  and restructuring costs 
fas r will be applied prospectively to any business combination completed after december  the impact of this standard will depend upon the nature  terms and size of business combinations completed after the effective date 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
fas 
fas will change the accounting and reporting for minority or noncontrolling interests 
upon adoption  these interests will be classified as a separate component within stockholders equity and transactions between controlling interest and minority interest holders will be accounted for within stockholders equity 
we will adopt fas in the first quarter of and are currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates and judgments the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies described below to be our critical accounting estimates and judgments 
these policies are affected significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
valuation in allocating the purchase price of our investments and testing our assets for impairment  we make estimates and assumptions to determine the value of our acquired client relationships  operating segments  and equity method investments 
we also assess the value of minority interests held by our affiliate managers in establishing the terms for their transfer 
in these valuations  we make assumptions of the growth rates and useful lives of existing and prospective client accounts 
additionally  we make assumptions of  among other factors  projected future earnings and cash flow  valuation multiples  tax benefits and discount rates 
in certain instances  we engage third party consultants to perform independent evaluations 
the impact of many of these assumptions is material to our financial condition and operating performance and  at times  is subjective 
if we used different assumptions  the carrying value of our equity method investments  our intangible assets and the related amortization could be stated differently and our impairment conclusions could be modified 
additionally  the use of different assumptions to value our minority interests could change the amount of compensation expense  if any  we report upon their transfer 
intangible assets at december   the carrying amounts of our intangible asset balances are as follows in millions definite lived acquired client relationships indefinite lived acquired client relationships goodwill  these amounts exclude million of definite lived acquired client relationships  and million of goodwill that are reported within equity investments in affiliates 
we amortize our definite lived acquired client relationships over their expected useful lives 
we reassess these lives each quarter based on historical and projected attrition rates and other events and circumstances that may influence the expected future economic benefit we will derive from the relationships 
significant judgment is required to estimate the period that these assets will contribute to our cash flows and the pattern over which these assets will be consumed 
a change in the remaining useful life of any of these assets could have a significant impact on the amount of our amortization expense 
for example  if we reduced the weighted average remaining life of our definite lived acquired client relationships by one year  our amortization expense would increase by approximately million per year 
we assess each of our definite lived acquired client relationship for impairment at least annually by comparing their carrying value to their projected undiscounted cash flows 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our most recent annual impairment test  and no impairments were identified 
we do not amortize our indefinite lived acquired client relationships because we expect these contracts will contribute to our cash flows indefinitely 
each quarter  we assess whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate these relationships might have a definite life 
we test the carrying amount of each of our indefinite lived acquired client relationships at least annually  or at such time that we conclude the assets no longer have an indefinite life by comparing the carrying amount of each asset to its fair value 
we derive the fair value of each of our indefinite lived acquired client relationships primarily based on discounted cash flow analysis 
our valuation analysis reflects assumptions of the growth of the assets  discount rates and other factors 
changes in the estimates used in these valuations could materially affect the impairment conclusion 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our most recent annual impairment test and no impairments were identified 
we test the carrying amount of the goodwill in each of our three operating segments at least annually by comparing their carrying amount to an estimate of fair value 
we establish the fair value of each of our operating segments primarily based on price earnings multiples 
changes in the estimates used in this test could materially affect our impairment conclusion 
in the third quarter of  we performed our most recent annual impairment test and no impairments were identified 
equity method investments for certain of our affiliates  where we own a minority interest and have the ability to participate in decision making  we apply the equity method of accounting 
accordingly  we evaluate these investments for impairment by assessing whether the fair value of the investment has declined below its carrying value for a period considered to be other than temporary 
additionally  we would consider the magnitude of any decline in market value and the expected holding period of the investment 
if we determine that a decline in market value below our carrying value is other than temporary  an impairment charge would be recognized in the consolidated statements of income to write down the carrying value of the investment to its fair value 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed our evaluation of investments accounted for under the equity method and no impairments were identified 
income taxes our overall tax position requires analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities 
tax regulations often require items of income and expense to be included in our tax returns in different amounts and in different periods than are reflected in the financial statements 
additionally  we must assess whether to recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position  and  if so  the appropriate amount of the benefit 
in our assessment of whether to recognize the benefit of an uncertain tax position  we consider the probability that a tax authority would sustain the tax position in an examination 
for tax positions meeting a more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the benefit expected to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
for tax positions not meeting this threshold  no benefit is recognized 
deferred taxes are established to reflect the differences in timing between the inclusion of items of income and expense in the financial statements and their reporting on our tax returns 
our deferred tax liabilities are generated primarily from tax deductible intangible assets and from our convertible securities 
as more fully described below  we generally believe that our intangible related deferred taxes are unlikely to reverse  and that our deferred tax liabilities for convertible securities may not reverse 
as such  we currently believe the economic benefit we realize from these sources will be permanent 
most of our intangible assets are tax deductible because we generally structure our affiliate investments as cash transactions that are taxable to the sellers 
we record deferred taxes because a substantial majority of our intangible assets do not amortize for financial statement purposes  but do amortize for tax purposes  thereby creating tax deductions that reduce our current cash taxes 
these liabilities will reverse only in the event of a sale of an affiliate or an impairment charge  events we consider unlikely to occur 
under current accounting rules  we are required to accrue the estimated cost of such a reversal as a deferred tax liability 
as of december   our estimate of the tax liability associated with such a sale or impairment charge was approximately million 
during  our convertible securities will generate deferred taxes of approximately million because our interest deductions for tax purposes are greater than our reported interest expense 
we believe that some or all of these deferred tax liabilities will be reclassified to equity as the securities are likely to convert to common stock when our stock price exceeds specified levels 
in addition  we also regularly assess our deferred tax assets  which consist primarily of state tax loss carryforwards  in order to determine the need for valuation allowances 
in our assessment we make assumptions about future taxable income that may be generated to utilize these assets  which have limited lives 
if we determine that we are unlikely to realize the benefit of a deferred tax asset  we would establish a valuation allowance that would increase our tax expense in the period of such determination 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance for all state tax loss carryforwards 
changes in our tax position could have a material impact on our earnings 
for example  a increase to our statutory tax rate attributable to our deferred tax liabilities would result in an increase of approximately million in our tax expense in the period of such determination 
share based compensation we have share based compensation plans covering senior management  employees and directors 
prior to  we accounted for share based compensation using the intrinsic value method described in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations 
accordingly  prior to  no compensation expense was recognized from share based compensation plans as the exercise price of all stock options granted equaled the market price of the underlying stock on the grant date of the award 
in  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fas r which requires a company to recognize share based compensation  based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date 
as a result  compensation is recognized in the financial statements for all share based payments granted after the date of adoption  and for all awards that are unvested after that date 
under fas r  we estimate the fair value of stock option awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model requires us to make assumptions about the volatility of our common stock and the expected life of our stock options based on past experience and anticipated future exercise behavior 
as an example  we considered both the historical volatility of our common stock and the implied volatility from traded options in determining expected volatility 
our options typically vest and become fully exercisable over three to five years of continued employment and do not include performance based or market based vesting conditions 
for grants that are subject to graded vesting over a service period  we recognize expense net of expected forfeitures on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
as of december   we had million in remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option grants  which will be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately four years assuming no forfeitures 
revenue recognition the majority of our consolidated revenue represents advisory fees asset based and performance based 
our affiliates recognize asset based advisory fees quarterly as they render services to their clients 
in addition to generating asset based fees  over affiliate products  representing approximately billion of assets under management  also bill on the basis of absolute investment performance performance fees 
these products  which are primarily in the institutional distribution channel  are generally structured to have returns that are not directly correlated to changes in broader equity indices and  if earned  the performance fee component is typically billed less frequently than the asset based fee 
our affiliates recognize performance fees when they are earned ie  when they become billable to customers based on the contractual terms of agreements and when collection is reasonably assured 
although performance fees inherently depend on investment results and will vary from period to period  we anticipate performance fees to be a recurring component of our revenue 
economic and market conditions global asset management industry the asset management industry has been a key driver of growth in financial services over the last decade 
according to the most recent available data  assets under management across all distribution channels total approximately trillion globally  of which trillion is managed in the united states 
we believe long term prospects for overall industry growth which have compounded at an annual rate of globally over the past four years remain strong 
we expect that this growth will be driven by market related increases in assets under management  broad demographic trends and wealth creation related to growth in gross domestic product  and will be experienced in varying degrees across each of the principal distribution channels for our affiliates products 
us asset management industry in the mutual fund distribution channel  according to a industry report  more than million individuals in almost million households in the united states are invested in mutual funds 
in  net cash flows to equity mutual funds totaled over billion  and aggregate mutual fund assets totaled trillion at the end of we anticipate that inflows to mutual funds will continue and that aggregate mutual fund assets  particularly those in equity mutual funds  will continue to increase in line with long term market growth 
assets in the institutional distribution channel in the united states are primarily in retirement plans  including both defined benefit and defined contribution plans  endowments and foundations  and totaled approximately trillion as of december  although the majority of institutional assets are in equities estimated to be in  allocations to alternative investments have continued to increase 
according to a recent study of institutional investors  allocations of institutional assets to hedge funds a core component of alternative investments have grown from of assets in to in  and are expected to increase to by we anticipate that the combination of an aging work force and long term market growth should contribute to the ongoing strength of this distribution channel 
the high net worth distribution channel is comprised broadly of high net worth and affluent individuals  family trusts and managed accounts 
within this channel  high net worth families and individuals those having at least million in investable assets in the united states had aggregate assets of trillion at the end of  industry experts expect assets in this segment of the channel to grow to trillion by the end of we believe that affluent individuals those having between  and million in investable assets represent an important source of asset growth within the high net worth channel  as the number of such individuals and the amount of investable assets increases  and the popularity of separately managed account investment products for affluent individuals continues to grow 
according to a recent industry report  assets in separately managed accounts totaled approximately trillion at the end of a nearly increase over year end 
international operations in connection with our international initiatives  we have offices in sydney  australia  london  england  and toronto  canada 
in addition  we have international operations through affiliates who provide some or a significant part of their investment management services to non us clients 
in the future  we may open additional offices  or invest in other investment management firms which conduct a significant part of their operations outside of the united states 
there are certain risks inherent in doing business internationally  such as changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer payment cycles  difficulties in collecting investment advisory fees receivable  different and in some cases  less stringent  regulatory and accounting regimes  political instability  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  expatriation controls  expropriation risks and potential adverse tax consequences 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our affiliated investment management firms that have international operations or on other investment management firms in which we may invest in the future and  consequently  on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation or changing prices have had a material impact on our results of operations
