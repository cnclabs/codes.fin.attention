item description of business life partners general 
life partners holdings  inc we or life partners is a financial services company and the parent company of life partners  inc lpi 
lpi is the oldest and one of the most active companies in the united states engaged in the secondary market for life insurance known generally as life settlements 
these financial transactions involve the purchase of life insurance policies at a discount to their face value for investment purposes 
the secondary market for life insurance policies 
lpi was incorporated in and has conducted business under the registered service mark life partners since our operating revenues are derived from fees for facilitating life settlement transactions 
life settlement transactions involve the sale of an existing life insurance policy to another party 
by selling the policy  the policyholder receives an immediate cash payment to use as he or she wishes 
the purchaser takes an ownership interest in the policy at a discount to its face value and receives the death benefit under the policy when the insured dies 
we are a financial services company  providing purchasing services for life settlements to our client base 
we do this by matching life settlors with purchasers 
we facilitate these transactions by identifying  examining  and purchasing the policies as agent for the purchasers 
in order to meet market demand and maximize our value to our clients  we have made significant investment in proprietary software and processes that enable us to facilitate a higher volume of transactions while maintaining our quality controls 
since our inception  we have facilitated over  purchaser transactions involving over  policies totaling over billion in face value 
we believe our experience  infrastructure and intellectual capital gives us a unique market position and will enable us to maintain sustainable growth within the life settlement market 
we match life settlors with purchasers 
we act as agent for settlement purchasers  for whom we identify and qualify policies 
we locate potential life settlors through a network of brokers  insurance  financial and estate planning professionals  through personal referrals and through internet and print media advertising 
brokers are typically compensated based on a percentage of the face value of the policy sold  which is paid upon the closing of a settlement 
estate planning professionals and financial planners typically operate on a fee for service basis  which is paid directly by their client 
we have long term relationships with most of the country s life settlement brokers and believe that these brokers adhere to applicable regulatory requirements when conducting their business 
in the fiscal year ended february   broker referrals accounted for of the total face value of policies transacted  compared to in fiscal policies presented from four brokers constituted of the total face value of all completed transactions presented by brokers during fiscal this compares to a concentration of of the total face value of all completed transactions from only two brokers in fiscal we believe this reduction in concentration as well as the addition of a number of new brokers indicates a reduction in concentration of market share among brokers 
we categorize our purchasers of life settlements as institutional or retail 
institutional purchasers are typically investment funds designed to acquire and hold life settlements 
these funds are often affiliated with large investment firms 
we have acted as the funds purchasing agent 
we may sponsor funds ourselves 
institutional purchasers are a growing part of our purchaser base reflecting the increasing acceptance of life settlements within the financial community 
most of our earlier purchasers were high net worth individuals  which we refer to as retail purchasers 
our retail purchasers generally come to us through a network of financial planners  whom we call licensees 
we develop this network through referrals and have long standing relationships with most of the financial planners 
although these financial planners can be compensated through fee based consultations paid by the purchaser  we compensate most of the financial planners based on the amount invested 
the compensation of financial planners is paid in cash generally upon the closing date of the transaction 
to purchase a life settlement  a prospective retail purchaser typically submits a purchaser application containing personal information such as the purchaser s name and address as well as affirmative representations establishing the purchaser as financially sophisticated 
a purchaser will also submit an agency agreement and special power of attorney  which appoints us as a limited agent of the purchaser to act on his or her behalf in purchasing a life settlement 
unless specifically waived by a purchaser  the agency agreement limits our authority to policies issued by an insurance carrier having an am best rating of b or better and to policies beyond their contestable period generally two years or older 
while in the past most insureds have had a life expectancy of months or less  we have expanded this market to include insureds with life expectancies of up to years or more depending on the purchasing parameters of each client 
as we identify and qualify policies fitting generally within the purchasing parameters of our clients  we distribute insurance and current medical status information on these policies with the insured s name and other identifying information redacted throughout our financial planner network 
we also make available to each financial planner standard disclosures discussing the nature and risks of making a life settlement purchase 
purchasers can then  in consultation with their financial planner or other professionals  select one or more policies  specify the portion of the policy or policies to be purchased and submit a reservation form either electronically or by fax 
to diversify their positions  retail purchasers generally buy fractional interests in one or more policies and not an entire policy  while institutional purchasers tend to purchase entire policies 
at the same time  purchasers mail or wire the acquisition price to the escrow agent and mail or fax a policy funding agreement to us 
the policy funding agreement identifies the policy or policies to be purchased  the acquisition price  the administrative services provided  and the escrow arrangements for receipt and disbursement of funds 
in essence  we act upon the instructions of the purchasers as their purchasing agent 
for the protection of the seller s ownership interest and the purchaser s monetary interest  all transactions are closed through an independent escrow agent 
the escrow agent will close a purchase when it receives from purchasers executed policy funding agreements and the acquisition price for a policy  verifies that the policy is in full force and effect and that no security interest has attached to the policy  and receives a transfer of policy ownership form acknowledged by the insurance company 
the escrow agent then pays the seller the offer price net of fees and costs 
we send confirmation of the transaction to the purchaser as well as a copy of the assignment documents 
after closing the transaction  we generally hold title to the policy as nominee for the purchaser 
responsibility for policy premium costs passes to the purchaser  who typically funds the premium costs through deposits with the escrow agent 
we strictly maintain the confidentiality of a life settlor s personal information in accordance with regulations promulgated by the texas department of insurance 
a purchaser will receive evidence of the transfer of ownership of the policy which identifies the insured  but will not receive contact information for the insured  which is available only to licensed life settlement companies like life partners 
we monitor the insured s health status and notify the escrow agent upon the insured s death 
we also notify purchasers in instances in which the premium escrow account has been exhausted so that the purchaser can replenish the account to keep the policy from lapsing 
we pioneered the foregoing transaction design and  since our formation  we have participated in the purchase of life settlement transactions totaling over billion in face value 
the life settlement market and competition 
life settlements provide a secondary market for existing life insurance policies that the owner no longer needs or wants and that insure a person whose life expectancy can be reasonably estimated 
over the past few years  the market for life settlements has grown substantially from both the demand and the supply sides of the transaction with an increase in the average face amount of policies presented for sale 
the larger amount of capital required to meet the higher acquisition costs of the average life settlement has led us to develop relationships with institutional purchasers in addition to expanding our base of retail clients and increasing the minimum investment amount 
we have devoted substantial marketing and client development resources to attracting both individual and institutional purchasers domestically and abroad  both directly and through their advisors 
the number of retail purchasers and the amount of their average investment have increased substantially providing us with a significant market advantage by enabling us to reach the diversification goals of our clients as well as giving us greater flexibility in purchasing policies 
we have also experienced success in attracting institutional clients and believe that we shall continue to attract institutional clients as we devote more time and resources into cultivating relationships with them 
one disincentive for domestic institutional investment had been the accounting treatment applied to the purchase of life insurance policies  which generally required that settlements be recorded at the cash surrender values of such policies instead of their purchase prices 
this treatment often resulted in substantial write downs for financial reporting purposes 
however  a change by the financial accounting standards board in the preferred method of accounting for life settlement contracts held for investment significantly changes the prior accounting treatment 
fasb staff position no 
accounting for life settlement contracts by third party investors fsp ftb states that an investor may elect to account for its investments in life settlement contracts based on the initial investment at the purchase price plus all initial direct costs 
continuing costs policy premiums and direct external costs  if any to keep the policy in force are capitalized 
fsp ftb replaces fasb technical bulletin  which essentially required that a purchaser record the excess of the purchase price over the cash surrender value as expense when purchasing policies 
we believe the adoption of this more favorable accounting treatment has spurred institutional investment  especially in the domestic market 
this accounting change has also had a positive effect on policies that we own  and we expect to increase the amount of policies that we purchase for our own investment 
we believe that the total face value of life settlement transactions completed during was about billion in face amount  which gives us a market share of approximately six percent  which is double our market share of approximately three percent last year 
this estimate is only an approximation  since precise market data is not available publicly and thus our competition is difficult to quantify 
we are the only publicly held company operating exclusively in this market 
some competitors file publicly available transaction activity with state insurance commissions 
not every company may report its transactions  however  and the accuracy of the information relies on the veracity of the filings made by each company 
in  conning research consulting  inc in its report entitled life settlement market increasing capital and investor demand estimated the face value of policies purchased in to be approximately billion 
conning had estimated the market to be from billion to billion 
our estimate of market activity is based in part on the conning report data as well as on reported transactions and known transaction volumes with allowance for unreported data and multiple reports of the same transaction 
while the overall life settlement market has grown in size and the number of market participants appears to have grown  we believe the market has become more fractured among market participants 
in earlier years  the market appeared to be dominated by one competitor  which had up to of the market 
due to regulatory problems  this competitor s position declined to the benefit of us and other competitors 
we believe that our four largest industry competitors currently have about of the market  but that none of them have more than 
the remaining of the market is divided among approximately other market participants 
unlike some of our competitors  which may have more restrictive purchasing parameters or a single provider of investment capital  we have developed markets for all types of life expectancies in order to accommodate the investment goals of our clients as well as the individual circumstances of the policies presented to us 
we believe this diversified capital business model makes us more competitive in the market and provides us with greater flexibility 
we also believe that this model provides a stronger platform for our sustainable growth as a company 
markets are segmented by length of life expectancy and policy face value 
the amount of competition in these markets varies according to the demand for such policies 
we believe the life settlement market in general will continue to increase substantially during the next year due to a number of factors 
first  market demand from purchasers remains strong for these transactions 
the competition for policies has increased  indicating that there is an increased awareness among the financial markets in general of the value of life settlements as an investment vehicle 
continued general economic uncertainty has led many purchasers to seek alternative investment strategies that diversify their portfolios and avoid economically sensitive investments 
life settlements provide diversification and produce returns that are not correlated to stock and bond market fluctuations or increasing commodity prices 
we believe that interest from both retail and institutional purchasers will continue to grow steadily throughout the next fiscal year 
a second contributing factor to the increase in the life settlement market is the greater supply of higher face value policies 
we believe there is a growing awareness of the secondary market for insurance policies among potential sellers  especially for those with higher face value policies 
this growing awareness has resulted in an expansion of the supply of eligible policies  especially policies with higher face values 
we believe much of our increased business is due to the greater supply of higher face value policies  and we believe this trend will continue 
we expect to increase our market share by growing our client base and utilizing our substantial intellectual capital and infrastructure to provide superior value to both policyholders and our clients 
among our core competencies is the ability to process and close transactions quickly and more efficiently than our competitors 
we believe our ability to deploy our assets into the market in this manner will enable us to continue to increase our market share 
although a life settlement transaction places no burden on an insurance company other than to honor its contract  life settlements are disfavored by insurance companies because they adversely affect their profitability by keeping policies in force that would otherwise have lapsed 
according to a december article in the new york times  insurance companies in reduced their financial exposure by trillion when million policyholders stopped paying premiums  citing data from the insurance information institute 
thus  the windfall profits earned by life insurance companies from policies that lapse are readily apparent 
data from the american council of life insurers shows that the voluntary termination rates for individual policies has dropped steadily from in to in because the decline in the lapse rate coincides with the increasing number of reported life settlement transactions  we believe this indicates that more policyholders are choosing to sell their policies in life settlement transactions rather than voluntarily terminating these policies 
we also believe this corroborates predictions that the life settlement market will continue to grow in size as these transactions become more familiar to policyholders 
access to capital  the insurance industry s addition of pre death cash benefits  law enforcement pressure on companies operating illegally  and increasing government regulation have contributed to a stabilization in the number and sophistication of life settlement companies  both those purchasing for their own accounts and those  like us  who act as agents for our clients 
we estimate the number of life settlement companies actively purchasing for their own account or as agents for purchasers has grown to approximately and the number of brokers to be approximately with the majority of policies being presented by fewer than five brokers 
while we believe we are one of the larger life settlement companies based on face value of policies settled  competition within the life settlement market is active among the few companies in this sector and we will continue to experience competition for qualified policies to purchase 
this competition will have an effect on the prices we pay for policies  the amount of brokerage and referral fees we pay  and the prices we set for the acquisition of policies 
we believe the overall market for life settlements will increase as more seniors become aware of their option to liquidate an unwanted policy through a life settlement 
in light of our experience in the market and our estimates concerning competition and supply and demand for policies  we believe our total business volume for life settlements will be approximately million in face value for fiscal  which is a increase over our total business volume of million in fiscal this estimate is projected  in part  on the total face value of settlements we have already experienced during this fiscal year as well as the increase in total business volume between fiscal and fiscal duhigg  charles  late in life  finding a bonanza in life insurance  new york times  december  the following table shows the number of life settlement contracts we have transacted  the aggregate face values and purchase prices of those contracts  and the revenues we derived  for our last three fiscal years number of settlements face value of policies average revenue per settlement total net revenues derived the revenues derived are exclusive of brokerage and referral fees 
industry regulation and taxation general 
when the life settlement market was first established  it was sparsely regulated 
due in part to abuses within the industry  which were well publicized  the federal government and various states moved to regulate the market in the mid s 
these regulations generally took two forms 
one sought to apply consumer protection type regulations to the market 
this application was designed to protect policyholders and purchasers 
another sought to apply securities regulations to the market  which was designed to protect purchasers 
various states have also used their insurance regulations to attack instances of insurance fraud within the industry 
consumer protection licensing 
the consumer protection type regulations arose largely from the draft of a model law and regulations promulgated by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
at least states have now adopted some version of this model law or another form of regulation governing life settlement companies in some way 
these laws generally require the licensing of providers and brokers  require the filing and approval of settlement agreements and disclosure statements  describe the content of disclosures that must be made to insureds and sellers  describe various periodic reporting requirements for settlement companies and prohibit certain business practices deemed to be abusive 
licensing 
many states require the licensing of life settlement brokers and providers  mandate disclosures to sellers or purchasers or both  require periodic reporting requirements  and set forth prohibited business practices 
we are licensed as a viatical and life settlement company by the texas department of insurance 
under the texas requirements  we must file our transaction documents with the state for approval  make certain disclosures to insureds and sellers  offer a day right of rescission to the seller  file certain annual reports with the state  and abstain from unfair business practices 
because all of our transactions are completed in texas  the department of insurance has jurisdiction to investigate complaints from any insured or seller  irrespective of the state in which that insured or seller lives 
consequently  we believe texas has exclusive regulatory authority and offers protection to all insureds or policyholders including those living in states that have no licensing requirement 
other states may assert regulatory jurisdiction  however  and to moderate the risk of adverse legal outcomes  we have begun licensing in certain states that are important to our business model and where exemptions from licensing requirements might be questionable 
we currently also hold a life settlement license in the following states maryland  north carolina  oklahoma  pennsylvania and tennessee 
in addition  we also have license applications pending in new jersey  ohio connecticut and virginia 
many important states have clearly identified exemptions from insurance licensing requirements  which permit our doing business without significant regulatory effects

jsp tdinum companyname life partners  inc systypecode pa securities regulations 
some states and the securities and exchange commission have attempted to treat life settlements as securities under federal or state securities laws 
we have structured our settlements to reduce the risk that they would be treated as securities under state or federal law  and  to date  no state or federal regulatory body or private litigant has successfully asserted that our settlements are securities 
we have faced such claims  however  most recently from state securities regulators in utah and colorado 
see item legal proceedings below 
these proceedings reflect the somewhat unsettled legal foundations of the life settlement industry 
we have vigorously contested these proceedings not so much because of the financial impact of avoiding these particular states  which would not have a material adverse effect on our business  but to protect our business model from the more widespread encroachment of regulatory treatments that we believe are unfair or improper 
we believe that a combination of consumer protection type laws and existing insurance regulations provide an appropriate framework for regulation of the industry 
as a practical matter  the widespread application of securities laws would burden us and other life settlement companies in marketing settlements with little or no benefit to purchasers 
each of our purchasers has represented themselves to be financially sophisticated  high net worth individuals or institutions  which have little need for the protections afforded by the securities laws 
at this point  due to the manner in which we structure our settlements and the availability  in some instances  of exceptions and exemptions under securities laws  such laws have not limited our business model to a significant extent 
but we cannot give assurance that our business would not be materially and adversely impacted by securities based regulation 
insurance regulation 
as a life settlement company  we facilitate the transfer of ownership in life insurance policies  but do not participate in the issuance of policies 
as such  we are not required to be licensed as an insurance company or insurance broker 
we do deal  however  with insurance companies and professionals in our business and are indirectly affected by the regulations covering them 
the insurance industry is highly regulated  and these regulations affect us in numerous ways 
we must understand the regulations as they apply to policy terms and provisions and the entitlement to  and collectibility of  policy benefits 
we rely upon the protections against fraudulent conduct that these regulations offer and we rely upon the licensing of companies and individuals with whom we do business 
employees as of february   we had direct employees  none of whom are represented by a labor union  as well as almost  licensees who act as independent contractors and refer clients to us for the purchase of life settlements 
we continuously review benefits and other matters of interest to our employees and consider our employee relations to be satisfactory

risk factors in addition to other information in this annual report on form k and in the documents we are incorporating by reference  the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business 
such factors significantly affect or could significantly affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that have been made pursuant to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of the risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we depend on growth in the life settlement market growth of the life settlement market and our expansion within the market may be affected by a variety of factors  including the inability to locate sufficient numbers of life settlors  the inability to convince potential sellers of the benefits of life settlements  the inability to attract sufficient qualified purchasers  competition from other life settlement companies  the occurrence of illegal or abusive business practices resulting in negative publicity about the market  and the adoption of overly burdensome governmental regulation 
in addition  the life settlement market may evolve in ways we have not anticipated and we may be unable to respond in a timely or cost effective manner 
if the life settlement market fails to grow as quickly as or in the directions we have anticipated  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected as it relates to our large scale growth 
our success depends on maintaining relationships within our referral networks we rely primarily upon brokers to refer potential sellers of policies to us and upon financial professionals  known as licensees  to refer retail purchasers to us 
these relationships are essential to our operations and we must maintain these relationships to be successful 
we do not have fixed contractual arrangements with the brokers or financial planners  and they are free to do business with our competitors 
in addition  the pool of brokers and referring financial planners is relatively small  which can increase our reliance on our existing relationships and impair attempts to reduce brokerage fees 
during fiscal  four brokers accounted for of the total face amount of policies we purchased 
our network of licensees is much broader  but no less important 
our ability to build and maintain relationships with our licensees will depend upon our closing rates  the value we bring to our retail clients and the level of compensation we pay to the referring professional 
the compensation paid to the referring professional will affect the offer price to the seller and the compensation we receive 
we must balance these interests successfully to build our referring network and attain greater profitability 
our purchasers depend on our ability to predict life expectancies and set appropriate prices  if our investment returns are not competitive  we may lose purchasers a purchaser s investment return from a life settlement depends on three factors the difference between the policy face amount and purchaser s cost basis consisting of the acquisition cost and premiums paid to maintain the policy  the length of the holding period  and the demise of the insured 
we price settlements based on the policy face amount  the anticipated life expectancy of an insured and policy maintenance costs 
life expectancies are generally estimated from standard medical and actuarial data based on the historical experiences of similarly situated persons 
the data is necessarily based on averages involving mortality and morbidity statistics 
the outcome of a single settlement may vary significantly from the statistical average 
it is impossible to predict any one insured s life expectancy exactly 
to mitigate the risk that an insured will outlive his or her predicted life expectancy  we price life settlements to yield competitive returns even if this life expectancy prediction is exceeded 
in addition  life settlement purchasers must be able to bear a non liquid investment for an indeterminate period 
if we underestimate the average life expectancies and price our transactions too high  our purchasers will not realize the returns they seek  demand may fall  and purchasers may invest their funds elsewhere 
in addition  amounts escrowed for premiums may be insufficient to keep the policy in force and it is the responsibility of the purchasers to pay these additional premiums 
if we overestimate the average life expectancies  the settlement prices we offer will fall below market levels  supply will decrease  and sellers may engage in business with our competitors or pursue other alternatives 
our ability to accurately predict life expectancies and price accordingly is affected by a number of factors  including the accuracy of our life expectancy estimations  which must sufficiently account for factors including an insured s age  medical condition  life habits such as smoking  and geographic location  our ability to anticipate and adjust for trends  such as advances in medical treatments  that affect life expectancy data  and our ability to balance competing interests when pricing settlements  such as the amounts paid to life settlors  the acquisition costs paid by purchasers  and the compensation paid to ourselves and our referral networks 
to foster the integrity of our pricing systems  we use both in house and outside experts  including medical doctors and published actuarial data 
we cannot assure you that  despite our experience in settlement pricing  we will not err by underestimating or overestimating average life expectancies or miscalculating reserve amounts for future premiums 
if we do so  we could lose purchasers or policy sellers  and those losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
government regulation could negatively impact our business we are licensed and regulated by the texas department of insurance as a viatical and life settlement company and hold licenses as a life settlement provider in other states as well 
state laws requiring the licensing of life settlement providers govern many aspects of our conduct  operations  advertising and disclosures 
the laws may vary from state to state  however  and our activities and those of brokers with whom we do business can be affected by changes in these laws or different interpretations of these laws 
in addition  some states and the securities and exchange commission treat life settlements as securities under state and federal securities laws 
because of legal precedent relating to our settlements and the possible availability of exceptions or exemptions under the securities laws  we do not believe that the application of securities laws will have a material adverse effect on our operations  but cannot assure you that securities regulators or private individuals will not attempt to apply the securities laws to our settlements or that such attempts would not have a material adverse effect on our business 
further  changes in laws or governmental regulation could affect our brokers or clients  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are operating in evolving markets that may be volatile we are operating in the life settlement market  which is a relatively new market within the financial services sector 
although it has grown exponentially in the past few years  how and to what extent it will continue to develop is uncertain 
because we are the only substantial publicly reporting company in this industry  measuring the market is difficult 
in  conning research consulting  inc estimated the life settlement market to be approximately billion in face value in based on our market experience and industry analysis  we believe this estimate is reasonable 
as more insureds become aware of life settlements as a financial planning option  we expect the size of the market to grow substantially 
while we have demonstrated our ability to originate  underwrite and place life settlements with our retail purchasers  any dramatic growth will depend heavily upon the entry of institutional purchasers and the increase in presentations of policies with face values in excess of million 
whether we can maintain markets for such policies will depend on our ability to attract more institutional and accredited investors and convince these purchasers that we can originate sufficient numbers of qualified policies for purchase and that our policy analysis and pricing practices are sound 
until we attract a sufficient number of institutional clients to provide for consistent and predictable demand in addition to the demand from our retail clients  our financial performance during any period may be materially affected by the entry or departure of one or more of our institutional clients from the market 
while we are among the most experienced and largest companies within these markets  our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by those attempting to operate in evolving markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in addressing the risks we face 
the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of future operations 
our chairman and chief executive officer beneficially owns of our common stock and  as a result  can exercise significant influence over our company mr 
brian d 
pardo  our chairman and chief executive officer  is defined under sec regulations as the beneficial owner of approximately of our common stock  largely as the result of exercising voting power by proxy over shares held by the pardo family trust 
he will be able to control most matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
his voting control affects indirectly the process for nominating directors  since theoretically he could nominate and elect directors without board involvement 
this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of life partners  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of common stock

this building was built in we occupy approximately  square feet of this building and have leased  square feet to an unaffiliated entity through july item legal proceedings during the fiscal year ended february   we incurred settlement expenses of  for the resolution of litigation or potential litigation 
a significant portion of this amount was related to litigation involving an alleged breach of contract which we settled to avoid the costs of litigation 
most other settlements involved purchaser claims and relatively minor settlement amounts 
in some instances  we have repurchased interests in policies to settle claims 
in these cases  only the excess if any of the settlement payment over the investment value of the repurchased policy interest is charged to settlement expense 
the balance is recorded on our balance sheet as an asset under investments in policies and the cash expenditure is recorded on our cash flow statement under purchase of policies for investment purposes and capitalized premiums 
for these types of settlements during fiscal  we recorded  of settlement expense and  for purchase of policies for investment purposes

we expect the resolution of this legal action and the costs of compliance will not exceed on november   we served a declaratory judgment action seeking a judicial ruling that the commissioner of the utah division of securities applied the utah securities act in an unconstitutional manner when he ordered an administrative show cause hearing to determine whether life partners and an independent financial planner violated the utah securities act in connection with certain life settlements transacted through our subsidiary  life partners  inc the declaratory judgment action is styled life partners  inc and life partners holdings  inc v

there are no pending motions and no discovery has been initiated  but we expect a trial date in october unless the matter is disposed of prior to that date

on june   a putative class action case entitled earl parchia et al 
v 
life partners  inc  cause no 
was filed against us in the th district court of mclennan county  texas 
although this action purports to represent a class of persons similarly situated  the court has not certified this case as a class action 
this action alleges breach of contract in connection with advising purchasers of premiums that come due on policies in which the escrow for premiums has been exhausted 
the case also alleges that we breached our contract with purchasers by selecting life insurance policies insuring the lives of individuals who were not actually terminally ill 
although we have filed a partial motion for summary judgment and discovery has been authorized  there has been no significant action in this matter since february  we believe there are numerous and substantial legal and factual issues that will prevent this matter from being certified as a class action and that will not support the claims made in this case 
we intend to vigorously defend this action  but we cannot predict or guarantee the outcome of the action 
on april   the state of texas initiated a suit against lpi for alleged violations of the texas deceptive trade practices act dtpa 
the suit stems from a contract lpi used with purchasers which had an ambiguous provision which made it unclear who was responsible for paying premiums to keep life insurance policies purchased in force 
lpi s contention was that the purchasers of the policy interests were responsible to pay premiums  as they were the owners of the policies 
the state of texas alleged that this was not the case and that lpi had violated the dtpa by requesting premiums from purchasers 
the case was initially filed in travis county  but was transferred to mclennan county 
on may   the trial court ruled for lpi on summary judgment  holding that the contract was ambiguous  and thus lpi did not violate the dtpa by interpreting the contract to mean the purchasers were responsible to pay premiums 
on june   the trial court entered a take nothing judgment against the state because the state lacked standing to bring a dtpa case over an ambiguous provision in a contract 
the state appealed this ruling to the th circuit court of appeals contending that venue was improper in mclennan county and that the trial court erred in holding the language of the contract was ambiguous 
the th circuit court of appeals originally ruled that the transfer of venue was improper  but later withdrew that opinion and ruled that the transfer of venue to mclennan county was proper  but that the trial court erred in holding that the language of the contract was ambiguous 
both the state and lpi have appealed issues to the supreme court of texas 
lpi appeals the decision of the appellate court on the basis that the question of ambiguity of language was not properly before the court and the court was not in a position to rule on the question of ambiguity of the contract language 
the state has appealed the decision of the appellate court that venue was proper in mclennan county and seeks to have venue returned to travis county 
separate petitions on these issues have been filed before the texas supreme court  but the texas supreme court has not ruled whether or not it will hear either or both of the petitions 
on september   we were served in a civil action by maxim group  llc in a case styled maxim group  llc v 
life partner sic holdings  inc  case number civ in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
plaintiff is an investment banking firm 
firm it claims that we entered into an investment banking contract with it in under which we agreed to issue a warrant for  shares of our common stock to plaintiff exercisable at any time during a five year period commencing on the date of the contract at an exercise price of per share 
we contend the warrant was consideration for plaintiff s services  that plaintiff never performed  and that we owe nothing 
we have filed a motion for summary judgment to dismiss this case  which is pending 
we intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter 
we are subject to other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business 
when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated  we reserve for such losses 
except as discussed above i management has not concluded that it is probable that a loss has been incurred in any of our pending litigation  ii management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of any pending litigation  and iii accordingly  management has not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes  if any 
it is possible that our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position could be materially affected in a particular fiscal quarter or fiscal year by an unfavorable outcome or settlement of any pending litigation 
nevertheless  although litigation is subject to uncertainty  management believes and we have been so advised by counsel handling the respective cases  that we have a number of valid claims and defenses in all pending litigation to which we are a party  as well as valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against us 
all such cases are  and will continue to be  vigorously defended and all valid counterclaims pursued 
however  we may enter into settlement discussions in particular cases if we believe it is in the best interests of our shareholders to do so

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations special note certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the reform act 
see special note regarding forward looking statements for additional factors relating to such statements 
we provide the following discussion to assist in understanding our financial position as of february   and results of operations for the years ended february   february   and february  as you read this discussion  refer to our consolidated statements of income and our consolidated balance sheet 
we analyze and explain the differences between periods in the material line items of these statements 
critical accounting estimates  assumptions and policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to guide our preparation  we follow accounting policies  some of which represent critical accounting policies as defined by the sec 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
certain accounting estimates involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that may have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent liabilities  and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period which management considers to be critical accounting estimates 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience  management s experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors that are believed to be reasonable 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results may differ materially from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 
areas affected by our estimates and assumptions are identified below 
we recognize income at the time a settlement closes and the purchaser has obligated itself to make the purchase 
we defer per viatical settlement and per life settlement to cover minor monitoring services provided subsequent to the settlement date 
we amortize this deferred cost over the anticipated life expectancy of the insureds 
we sometimes advance loans to facilitate a life settlement transaction 
these amounts are included in accounts receivable trade  and are collected as the life settlement transactions close 
all amounts are considered collectible  as we are repaid the advance loan before any of the other parties involved in the transaction receive funds 
for life insurance policies purchased for our own account in fiscal year and before  we followed financial standards board technical bulletin accounting for purchases of life insurance ftb  which required that we reduce our investment in the policies to the cash surrender value of such policies with any differences between cost and cash surrender value being charged to expense 
on march   fasb staff position no 
ftb accounting for life settlement contracts by third party investors fsp ftb was issued  which amends ftb the fasb staff position states that an investor may elect to account for its investments in life settlement contracts using either the investment method or the fair value method 
the election shall be made on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable 
under the investment method  an investor shall recognize the initial investment at the purchase price plus all initial direct costs 
continuing costs policy premiums and direct external costs  if any to keep the policy in force shall be capitalized 
under the fair value method  an investor shall recognize the initial investment at the purchase price 
in subsequent periods  the investor shall re measure the investment at fair value in its entirety at each reporting period and shall recognize change in fair value earnings or other performance indicators for entities that do not report earnings in the period in which the changes occur 
fsp ftb is required to be applied to fiscal years beginning after june  we elected to adopt fsp ftb as of march  the beginning of fiscal 
we expect to value our investments in life settlement contracts using the investment method 
as of february   our investments in life settlements held for our own account were valued at  this change in accounting principle resulted in an increase in the value of life settlements which we hold for our own account of  we establish litigation and policy analysis loss reserves based on our best estimates as to the ultimate outcome of contingent liabilities 
this reserve analysis is necessary to properly match current expenses to currently recognized revenues and to recognize that there is a certain amount of liability associated with litigation and policy losses 
through this reserve  we recognize the estimated cost to settle pending litigation as an expense 
these estimates are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted to management s best estimate of the anticipated liability on a case by case basis 
a high degree of judgment is required in determining these estimated reserve amounts since the outcomes are affected by numerous factors  many of which are beyond our control 
as a result  there is a risk that the estimates of future litigation and policy analysis loss costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 
any difference between estimates and actual final outcomes should not have a material impact on our financial statements 
we have not experienced any material changes between estimates and actual results in the current or prior periods 
we must make estimates of the collectability of accounts and notes receivable and premium advances 
the accounts associated with these areas are critical to recognizing the correct amount of revenue in the proper period 
because of the uncertainty about when policy advances will be collected  we follow the practice of reserving all premium advances at the time such advances are made 
when premium advances are repaid  the repayments are netted against premium expense 
we have not experienced any material changes in our estimates of collectability versus actual results in the current or prior periods 
we review the carrying value of the property and equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in cases where undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of assets 
the factors considered by management in performing this assessment includes current operating results  trends and prospects  the manner in which the property is used  and the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
based on this assessment  there was no impairment at february  we must evaluate the useful lives of our property and equipment to assure that an adequate amount of depreciation is being charged to operations 
useful lives are based generally on specific knowledge of an asset s life in combination with the internal revenue service rules and guidelines for depreciable lives for specific types of assets 
we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include a tax provision or reduce our tax benefit in the statements of income 
we use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we cannot predict what future laws and regulations might be passed that could have a material effect on our results of operations 
we assess the impact of significant changes in laws and regulations on a regular basis and update the assumptions and estimates used to prepare our financial statements when we deem it necessary 
we have not made any material changes to our critical accounting estimates or assumptions or the judgments affecting the application of those estimates or assumptions 
we discuss our significant accounting policies  including those policies that are not critical  in note of our consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements on march   fasb staff position no 
accounting for life settlement contracts by third party investors fsp ftb was issued 
see critical accounting estimates  assumptions and policies above 
other recent accounting pronouncements have been issued including fasb statements no 
r     and  fin and sab for a discussion of these pronouncements  refer to footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
life partners we are the world s oldest and only publicly traded company operating exclusively in the life settlement industry 
our revenues are primarily derived from fees associated with facilitating life settlement transactions 
comparison of years ended february  and february  and we had net income of  for the year ended february  fiscal  as compared to net income of  for the year ended february  fiscal and  for the year ended february  fiscal 
the increase in net income in fiscal is attributable primarily to a increase in revenues and a increase in revenues net of brokerage and licensee fees 
the large increase in revenues  net of brokerage fees  resulted in an increase in income from operations of 
the increase in net income in fiscal was attributable to an almost increase in income from operations  and  to a lesser extent  to increases in interest income and in realized gains on investments 
fiscal operating income of  was aided by gains on sales of policies held for investment of  legal costs in fiscal were   in fiscal and  in fiscal and  after payroll  comprised the largest single general and administrative expense 
the costs were attributable primarily to our prosecution of lawsuits against the states of virginia and utah and in defending ourselves in the arbitration against our former investment bankers 
see item legal proceedings 
revenues revenues increased by  or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase was due primarily to a increase in our total business volume as measured by the face value of all policy settlements transacted through us and a increase in the average revenue per settlement from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the number of settlements we transacted in fiscal decreased by from last year continuing a trend toward fewer transactions  but with larger face amounts 
revenues in fiscal increased by  or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal this increase was also a result of the increase in policy face amounts and in average revenue per settlement 
during the periods  demand for our services remained strong and the number of policies presented to us and meeting our purchasing qualifications grew 
growth in demand was especially strong for policies with higher face values among both institutional and retail clients  and we anticipate this demand trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
most of our competitors have adopted a single or preferred client business model  which relies on a relatively narrow purchaser base 
in contrast  we employ a broad based  multi client business model and our purchaser base is much broader 
while a single purchaser may account for a substantial share of revenues during a particular quarterly period  we do not intend to become reliant upon any single purchaser and expect that no single purchaser will account for a substantial share of revenues during the long term 
with our multi client business model  we believe we can serve the demand for all our current and future clients 
we believe this business model will permit us to achieve sustainable growth for the foreseeable future  without the risks associated with a single or limited number of clients 
we believe the increasing demand for our services results from several factors  one of which is an investment trend toward diversifying investment portfolios and avoiding economically sensitive investments 
returns on life settlements are linked to the lives of the insureds 
as such  settlements function independently from  and are not correlated to  traditional equity and debt markets and commodity investments 
we benefit from the investment community searching for returns higher than what is currently available in the traditional marketplace 
demand for our services emanates from both domestic and international purchasers  and the ratio of domestic clients to international clients was relatively unchanged from last year 
in fiscal  approximately of our business was from domestic purchasers while approximately was from foreign purchasers 
in fiscal  this ratio was from domestic business and from foreign business and in fiscal  the ratio was from domestic business and from foreign business 
we do not anticipate significant changes in the ratio between domestic and foreign business 
another contributing factor has been the greater supply of higher face value policies 
we believe there is a growing awareness of the secondary market for insurance policies among potential sellers  especially for those with higher face value policies 
this growing awareness has resulted in an expansion of the supply of eligible policies  especially policies with higher face values 
we believe much of our increased business is due to the greater supply of higher face value policies  and we believe this trend will continue 
increased demand for our services was also aided by the institution of legal proceedings against the industry s largest life settlement provider 
in october  the attorney general for the state of new york filed a civil lawsuit against our principal competitor claiming it violated fraud and antitrust laws by making secret payments to brokers that stifled bidding and that were unknown to policy sellers 
in may  the state of florida filed a show cause order against the same competitor alleging similar unfair business practices 
while we cannot assess the merits of the allegations in these proceedings  our total business volume increased after the filing of the new york proceeding  and we believe we have sufficient empirical data to classify this increase as a trend that continued into fiscal in addition to any direct effect on our operating results  we believe these proceedings had a profoundly positive effect on the life settlement market in general  promoting fair dealing in the market and underscoring the fiduciary duty owed by brokers to sellers 
a cleaner  more transparent market will have lasting benefits for the industry generally and us particularly 
brokerage and referral fees brokerage and referral fees increased or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal brokerage and referral fees increased or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal brokerage and referral fees constituted of revenues in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  broker referrals accounted for of the total face value of policies transacted  while this percentage for fiscal was and for fiscal was 
policies presented from four brokers constituted of the total face value of all completed transactions presented by brokers during fiscal this compares to a concentration of of the total face value of all completed transactions from only two brokers in fiscal and in fiscal brokerage and referral fees generally increase or decrease with revenues  face values of policies transacted and the volume of transactions  although the exact ratio may vary according to a number of factors 
brokers may adjust their fees with the individual policyholders whom they represent 
in some instances  several brokers may compete for representation of the same seller  which will result in lower broker fees 
referral fees also vary depending on factors such as varying contractual obligations  market demand for a particular kind of policy or life expectancy category  individual agreements between clients and their referring financial planners 
no broker fees are paid when a viator or life settlor is not represented by a broker and presents a policy to us directly 
some states are moving to license life settlement brokerage activity  which may result in the capping of fees or the disclosure of fees  either of which would tend to lower the fees 
the new york attorney general s suit discussed above may further encourage the disclosure or regulation of brokerage compensation 
brokerage fees associated with the purchase of policies for our own investment are not included in this line item  but are included under the line item entitled policy acquisition expense 
operating expense general and administrative expenses increased by or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  although such expense as a percentage of revenues was lower in fiscal executive bonuses increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal these payments are a direct result of the increased company profitability  which is linked to executive compensation plans 
general and administrative expenses increased by or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal also included in fiscal general and administrative expenses are substantial legal expenses of  primarily associated with the prosecution of legal actions against the state of virginia and the state of utah and in defending ourselves in an arbitration action filed by an investment banking group 
this compares favorably with  for non recurring legal expenses in fiscal legal expenses were  in fiscal  with essentially the same cases as fiscal see item legal proceedings 
in unrelated legal actions  we experienced non recurring settlement expenses of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal we made advances on policy premiums primarily to maintain certain older viatical settlement transactions 
during fiscal  and  we made premium advances of   and  respectively  and were reimbursed   and  respectively 
the settlements  most of which were made before  allegedly lacked sufficient disclosure about the purchaser s obligation to pay premiums in order to maintain an acquired policy 
while we have steadfastly denied any legal liability or contractual obligation to do so  we have advanced premiums as an accommodation to some purchasers 
reimbursements for these premiums will come either from the purchasers or from the distribution of such purchaser s proceeds paid when the insured dies 
premium advances have been recorded as an expense at the time they are made with collections being treated as a reduction in this expense 
we are unable to estimate the amount of any future advances we may elect to make or the amount of reimbursements we are likely to receive 
because of our inability to estimate these amounts  we do not accrue amounts for future advances or reimbursements 
interest income and expense interest and other income grew from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase corresponds to higher investment account balances in those years 
interest expense varied from  in fiscal to  in fiscal and  in fiscal our interest expense relates primarily to the long term debt financing on our property 
income taxes income tax expense increased by  or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to a increase in income before taxes 
income tax expense increased by  or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to a increase in income before taxes 
liquidity and capital resources operating activities net cash flows provided by operating activities during fiscal increased by or  to  compared with net cash flows provided by operating activities of  for fiscal and  in fiscal this increase in cash flows from operating activities was attributable primarily to a or  increase in net income from  in fiscal to  in fiscal  and a or  increase in net income in fiscal vs 
fiscal the increase was helped by an increase in accounts payable of  compared to an increase of  in fiscal the increase in operating activities cash flow was diminished by i an increase in accounts receivable of  compared to an increase of  in fiscal  and ii a decrease in net income tax payable of  versus an increase in fiscal of  in fiscal  we expensed costs of  in connection with the formation of a limited partnership arrangement with a large us based investment firm 
when the limited partnership did not make any settlement purchases  we terminated the partnership without penalty according to the terms of the limited partnership agreement 
when we terminated the arrangement  we were required to recognize those capitalized costs as an expense 
of these expensed costs   were funds advanced to an investment banker  which we recovered in an arbitration action after the close of fiscal the recovery resulted in a reduction to our impairment of investment in limited partnership by that amount 
the increase in our accounts receivable stems largely from the increased amount of revenue attributable to policies for which a closing was imminent  but which had not been released from escrow by the end of the period 
the increase in our accounts payable was largely the result of the increased brokerage and referral fees associated with transactions that had not been released from escrow by the end of the period 
investing and financing activities we used cash of  in investing activities in fiscal vs 
 in fiscal and  in fiscal we purchased  in income funds in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal we invested  in property and equipment in fiscal versus  in fiscal and  in fiscal in fiscal  this was primarily due to the purchase of the land and building adjacent to our corporate headquarters and the company plane  which was also sold in fiscal we issued notes receivable totaling  for cash advanced to a company in fiscal we purchased policies for investment purposes in fiscal for  vs 
 in fiscal and  in in fiscal  we received proceeds from the sale of policies of  we used  in financing activities in fiscal vs 
 in fiscal and a source of  in fiscal we paid down  on our operating line of credit and loans in fiscal compared with payments of  in fiscal and  in fiscal we received proceeds from loans of  in fiscal and  in fiscal we used cash to pay dividends of  in fiscal  which increased the prior dividend level 
we paid dividends of  in fiscal and  in fiscal we purchased shares on the open market treasury shares for  in fiscal working capital and capital availability as of february   we had working capital of  our cash during fiscal increased by  compared with an increase of  in fiscal and  in fiscal to facilitate the purchase of policies for our own account and for short term cash flow management and operating capital requirements  we maintain a credit line 
the credit line is secured by our cash and securities on deposit 
as of february   the line of credit carried an interest rate at new york prime and had a borrowing base of million 
the balance outstanding at february   consisted of unpaid interest and was we believe future income from operating activities will generate sufficient profits and cash flows to meet our anticipated working capital needs 
in addition  we continue to explore the formation of life settlement investment funds  whether sponsored externally or internally and other types of financing opportunities  which will provide more capital for us to purchase more policies for our own investment 
our financial strategy is to increase cash flows generated from operations by increasing revenues while controlling brokerage and general and administrative expenses 
we believe that domestic and international demand for life settlements  especially from institutional purchasers  will continue to grow during the next year as the prospects for economic conditions remain uncertain  as the popularity of non correlated assets continues to grow  and as we gain competitive advantage in a growing market 
in addition to our traditional retail base  we have expanded our services to accommodate institutional purchasers 
we have acted as a fund advisor for three institutional funds and anticipate expanding these services in combination with our current life settlement provider services 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any off balance sheet arrangements or transactions
