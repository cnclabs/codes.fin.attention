item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors including those set forth under the heading risk factors elsewhere herein 
general we are a diversified biotechnology business  through the development of proprietary technologies  products and services in the areas of drug development  genetic analysis  molecular diagnostics  nanotechnology research  defense and homeland security markets  as well as other potential markets where our products and services could be utilized 
the technologies we have developed include a platform technology to rapidly produce customizable  in situ synthesized  oligonucleotide arrays for use in identifying and determining the roles of genes  gene mutations and proteins 
this technology has a wide range of potential applications in the areas of genomics  proteomics  biosensors  drug discovery  drug development  diagnostics  combinatorial chemistry  material sciences and nanotechnology 
we have also developed the capabilities of producing arrays that utilize bacterial artificial chromosomes on our arrays  also enabling genetic analysis 
other technologies include proprietary molecular synthesis and screening methods for the discovery of potential new drugs 
we currently recognize revenues from selling these products and services and providing research and development services for organizations including the us department of defense and other strategic partners 
cmdx  our wholly owned subsidiary located in irvine  california  is exploring opportunities for our arrays in the field of molecular diagnostics 
this subsidiary has historically focused on product development and has begun generating modest revenues 
prior relationship with acacia research corporation we were originally incorporated in october as a california corporation and later reincorporated as a delaware corporation in september on december   we merged with and became a wholly owned subsidiary of acacia 
on the same date  acacia entered into a recapitalization transaction whereby acacia created two classes of registered common stock ie  ar combimatrix stock and ar acacia technologies stock and divided its existing acacia common stock into shares of the two new classes of common stock 
the ar combimatrix stock was intended to reflect separately the performance of the combimatrix corporation and its subsidiaries  referred to as the combimatrix group  whereas the ar acacia technologies stock was intended to reflect separately the performance of acacia s technology business  referred to as acacia technologies group 
in december  we filed a registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission or sec to register our common stock in order to affect a split off of our company from acacia by redeeming shares of existing ar combimatrix common stock with our common stock 
the form s was declared effective by the sec on june  and on august  the redemption date  each one share of our common stock was issued in exchange for every ten shares ar combimatrix common issued and outstanding on august  the redemption ratio 
since the redemption date  we are no longer a subsidiary or an affiliate of acacia  and the holders of ar combimatrix became the shareholders of our company 
our common stock currently trades on the nasdaq global market under the symbol cbmx 
liquidity at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
as a result  we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalent balances  anticipated cash flows from operations and other sources of funding from the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through september of in order for our company to continue as a going concern beyond this point and ultimately to achieve profitability  we will be required to obtain capital from external sources  increase revenues and reduce operating costs 
however  there can be no assurance that such capital will be available at times and at terms acceptable to us  or that higher levels of product and service revenues will be achieved 
the issuance of additional equity securities will also cause dilution to our shareholders 
if external financing sources of financing are not available or are inadequate to fund our operations  we will be required to reduce operating costs including research projects and personnel  which could jeopardize the future strategic initiatives and business plans of our company 
as of december   our available for sale investments included million of certain auction market securities  million of which failed to settle at auction in february and march of the inability to liquidate the remainder of these securities at par value in the near future could materially jeopardize our ability to execute our business strategies 
see the liquidity and capital resources section below as well as notes and to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these matters 
basis of presentation of financial statements the consolidated financial statements included in this report are consistent with the combimatrix group historical financial statements included in acacia s regulatory filings and include the assets  liabilities  operating results and cash flows of combimatrix corporation using acacia s historical bases in the assets and liabilities and the historical results of operations of combimatrix corporation 
the consolidated financial statements also include allocations of certain acacia corporate expenses  including governance  legal  accounting  insurance services  treasury and other acacia corporate and infrastructure costs 
the expense allocations have been determined on bases that we determined with acacia to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided or the benefit received by us and are discussed in more detail below 
overview of recent business activities during  our operating activities were driven by the execution of a new government contract with the dod totaling million to be recognized through our diagnostics subsidiary  cmdx  launched several new diagnostic services using its constitutional genetic array test  or cgat  during year  including its hemescan test for myelodysplastic syndromes and acute lymphoblastic leukemia  as well as launching its new atscan test for the detection of autism spectrum disorder 
in may of  acacia completed a registered direct offering of its ar combimatrix common stock with proceeds of million allocated to us 
as discussed elsewhere  our split off from acacia research corporation was completed in august of and our common stock began trading on nasdaq under the symbol  cbmx 
historically  we have relied primarily upon investing and financing activities to fund operating activities 
our net proceeds from investing and financing activities in were consistent with prior years and at december  our cash and cash equivalent balances  including anticipated cash flows from future operations and other existing sources of credit are not considered to be sufficient to meet our operating capital requirements beyond september of we will continue to seek additional sources of capital including the issuance of debt and or equity securities 
during  our operating activities were driven by the execution of two new government contracts with the dod totaling million to be recognized through as well as the execution of several new distribution agreements for our customarray products  both nationally and internationally 
we launched our first k  high density array and array synthesizer in may of and made available new versions of our influenza a and mirna product offerings 
our diagnostics subsidiary  cmdx  received clia certification over its diagnostics laboratory and subsequently launched its first molecular diagnostic service using its cgat platform  during the second quarter of we also received notice from the fda  that cmdx does not require regulation covered by recent fda guidelines covering certain of its diagnostic assays 
during  our activities included the formation of a wholly owned subsidiary  cmdx and the launch of its molecular diagnostics business for the purpose of exploiting the opportunities in the molecular diagnostics market for our technology 
we executed several distribution agreements for our customarray platform and related products with distributors in the united states  asia and australia 
we also expanded our product offerings by launching a desktop version of our dna array synthesizer as well as new customarray catalog arrays  including an influenza hn array  sectored arrays and micro rna products 
in the area of bio defense  we continued progress on our million contract with the dod  which was completed in december of as a result of these activities  our research and development efforts were focused primarily on completing our bio defense contract  launching our molecular diagnostics business as well as continuing development of new products and services based on our core array technology as well as making improvements to existing customarray products launched during and earlier 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing these financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates and make changes accordingly 
we believe that  of the significant accounting policies discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments revenue recognition  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and  allocated corporate overhead costs from acacia 
we discuss below the critical accounting assumptions  judgments and estimates associated with these policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for further information on our critical accounting policies  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
revenue recognition as described below  significant management judgments must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenue recognized or deferred for any period if management made different judgments 
in general  we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab no 
 when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii all obligations have been performed pursuant to the terms of the agreement  iii amounts are fixed or determinable and iv collectibility of amounts is reasonably assured 
revenue from the sale of products and services  including shipping and handling fees but excluding statutory sales taxes collected from customers as applicable  are recognized when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
we sell our products and services directly to customers and also through distributors  and our right to collection is not dependent upon installation or a subsequent sale of our products to end users 
our agreements do not provide for credits  returns or exchanges with our customers or distributors 
our distribution agreements include fixed pricing arrangements for our products and after customer acceptance  there is no written or implied right to return or exchange the products 
revenues from government grants and contracts are recognized in accordance with accounting research bulletin arb no 
 government contracts  and related pronouncements  such as statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
accordingly  revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting  using the cost to cost approach to measure completeness at each reporting period 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  contract revenues and expenses are recognized in the period that work is performed based on the percentage of actual incurred costs to the total contract costs 
actual contract costs include direct charges for labor and materials and indirect charges for labor  overhead and certain general and administrative charges 
contract change orders and claims are included when they can be reliably estimated and are considered probable 
for contracts that extend over a one year period  revisions in contract cost estimates  if they occur  have the effect of adjusting current period earnings applicable to performance in prior periods 
should current contract estimates indicate an overall future loss to be incurred  a provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
significant estimates  judgments and assumptions are required primarily in connection with our accounting for multiple element arrangements with strategic partners and licensees 
we account for revenues under multiple element arrangements in accordance with sab no 
and emerging issues task force consensus  or eitf  issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and related pronouncements 
arrangements with multiple elements or deliverables must be segmented into individual units of accounting based on the separate deliverables only if there is objective and verifiable evidence of fair value to allocate the consideration received to the deliverables 
accordingly  revenues from multiple element arrangements involving license fees  up front payments and milestone payments  which are received and or billable in connection with other rights and services that represent our continuing obligations are deferred until all of the multiple elements have been delivered or until objective and verifiable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements has been established 
upon establishing objective and verifiable evidence of the fair value of the elements in multiple element arrangements  the fair value is allocated to each element of the arrangement  such as license fees or research and development projects  based on the relative fair values of the elements 
we determine the fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements based on objective and verifiable evidence of fair value  which is determined for each element based on the prices charged when the similar elements are sold separately to third parties 
if objective and verifiable evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but objective and verifiable evidence of fair value does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the revenues from delivered elements are not recognized until the fair value of the undelivered element or elements have been determined 
significant contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements  when to recognize revenue for each element  and the period over which revenue should be recognized 
changes in the allocation of the sales price between delivered to undelivered elements might impact the timing of revenue recognition  but would not change the total revenue recognized on the contract 
deferred revenues arise from payments received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process 
deferred revenues expected to be recognized within the next twelve months are classified within current liabilities 
deferred revenues will be recognized as revenue in future periods when the applicable revenue recognition criteria as described above are met 
stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas no 
r sets forth the accounting requirements for share based compensation payments to employees and non employee directors and requires all share based payments to be recognized as expense in the statement of operations 
in march  the sec published staff accounting bulletin no 
 which requires stock based compensation to be classified in the same expense line items as cash compensation ie  marketing  general and administrative and research and development expenses 
the compensation cost for all stock based awards is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award determined using a black scholes option pricing model  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires significant estimates and judgments  including estimating the market price volatility of our classes of common stock and employee stock option exercise behavior 
sfas no 
r also requires stock based compensation expense to be recorded only for those awards expected to vest using an estimated pre vesting forfeiture rate 
as such  sfas no 
r requires us to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant and reflect the impact of estimated pre vesting option forfeitures on compensation expense recognized 
estimates of pre vesting forfeitures must be periodically revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we consider several factors in connection with our estimate of pre vesting forfeitures including types of awards  employee class  and historical pre vesting forfeiture data 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as cumulative adjustments in the period the estimates are revised 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves the estimating of our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  amortization of intangibles and asset depreciation for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our valuation allowance 
after consideration of our deferred tax liabilities  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets of million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward  before they expire 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we have considered our estimates of future taxable income  the period over which our deferred tax assets may be recoverable  our history of losses and our assessment of the probability of continuing losses in the foreseeable future 
in our estimate  any positive indicators  including forecasts of potential future profitability of our businesses  are outweighed by the uncertainties surrounding our estimates and judgments of potential future taxable income 
if actual results differ from these estimates or if we adjust these estimates because we believe we would be able to realize these deferred tax assets in the future  then an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
any changes in the valuation allowance could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill goodwill is evaluated for impairment using a fair value approach at the reporting unit level annually  or earlier if an event occurs or circumstances changes that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
a reporting unit can be an operating segment or a business if discrete financial information is prepared and reviewed by management 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we had recognized goodwill in the amount of million   and  at our three reporting units combimatrix corporation and two wholly owned subsidiaries  advanced materials sciences and combimatrix kk  respectively 
under the impairment test  if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  goodwill impairment is recognized to the extent that the reporting unit s carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill 
as discussed below  we recognized an impairment for all of the goodwill associated with advanced materials sciences and combimatrix kk during the fourth quarter of and as a result  we only have one reporting unit for purposes of measuring goodwill impairment as of and for the year ended december  and the fair value of the combimatrix corporation reporting unit is determined using existing market prices for our common stock ar combimatrix stock prior to the redemption date 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant adverse changes in legal factors or in the business climate  including adverse regulatory actions or assessments  and significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period 
we calculate estimated future undiscounted cash flows  before interest and taxes  resulting from the use of the asset and our estimated value of the asset at disposal and compare it to our carrying value of the asset in determining whether impairment potentially exists 
if a potential impairment exists  a calculation is performed to determine the fair value of the long lived asset 
this calculation is based on a valuation model and discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
third party appraised values may also be used in determining whether impairment potentially exists 
as described above  in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  estimates of market values and projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are used to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in future periods  future goodwill impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings 
in applying these accounting practices  we recognized a charge from goodwill impairment of approximately  during the fourth quarter of this amount represents the full amount of goodwill recognized by our company as a result of our acquisitions of both advanced materials sciences and combimatrix kk in july allocation of corporate overhead costs from acacia prior to the redemption date  acacia allocated the cost of corporate general and administrative services and facilities between its subsidiaries and reporting groups generally based upon utilization 
for example  direct salaries  payroll taxes and fringe benefits were allocated to the groups based on the percentage of actual time incurred by specific employees to total annual time available and direct costs including  postage  insurance  legal fees  accounting and tax and other were allocated to the groups based on specific identification of costs incurred on behalf of each group 
other direct costs  including direct depreciation expense  computer costs  general office supplies and rent were allocated to the groups based on the ratio of direct salaries to total salaries 
indirect costs  including indirect salaries and benefits  investor relations  rent  general office supplies and indirect depreciation were allocated to the groups based on the ratio of direct salaries for each group to total direct salaries 
except as otherwise determined by management  the allocated costs of providing such services and facilities include  without limitation  all costs and expenses of personnel employed in connection with such services and facilities  including  without limitation  all direct costs of such personnel  such as payroll  payroll taxes and fringe benefit costs calculated at the appropriate annual composite rate and all overhead costs and expenses directly related to such personnel and the services or facilities provided by them 
the corporate general and administrative services and facilities allocated by acacia included  without limitation  legal services  accounting services tax and financial  insurance and related deductibles if applicable  employee benefit plans and administration  investor relations  shareholder services and expenses relating to acacia s board of directors 
corporate expenses totaling   and  and for the years ended december   and  respectively  were allocated to us by acacia 
since the redemption date  acacia is no longer allocating corporate overhead costs to us 
management estimates and judgments are required with respect to the allocations of overhead costs of acacia to us 
had different assumptions and allocation methodologies been used different accounting treatment for such costs may have been required 
also  these allocations are not necessarily indicative of the actual costs we would have incurred had we been a separate  stand alone entity  nor are they necessarily indicative of the actual costs we will incur in the future for similar corporate general and administrative costs as a separate  stand alone entity 
results of operations revenues and cost of revenues in thousands for the years ended december  government contracts    cost of government contracts    products    cost of products   services collaboration agreements  government contracts and cost of government contract revenues 
the changes in government contract revenues reflect the ongoing performance of our electrochemical detection  microfluidics and influenza genotyping contracts with the dod for the years presented 
changes in the number of contracts underway coupled with changes in the underlying contract activity contributes to the overall increase or decrease in government contracts revenue from year to year 
the changes in contract activity also contribute to the change in government contract costs for the years presented 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed description of the amounts  completion rates and estimated costs to complete of our government contracts that are ongoing as well as prior contracts that were completed during the years presented 
products and cost of products 
product revenues and costs of products relate to domestic and international sales of our dna microarray products 
product revenues include the sale of customarray k  xk and k dna expression arrays  dna microarray synthesizers  electrasense microarray readers and related hardware 
the decrease in product revenues in compared to was due primarily to fewer dna synthesizer instruments sold in compared to as we expand our business focus from exclusively selling array based research and development products to providing array based diagnostic services  we have reduced internal sales staff  marketing and production efforts during regarding sales of customarray products and instead are relying more on our product distribution and manufacturing agreements with various third party distributors for sales generation of our suite of customarray products into the research and development markets 
as a result  customarray product revenues will likely be volatile in future periods depending on the sales efforts of our distributors 
during  products sales included the sale of dna synthesizer instruments and customarray k dna expression arrays and related hardware compared to significantly lower instrument and k dna expression array sales during the overall increase in product revenues during was due primarily to the increased product offerings  which included k and xk arrays  dna synthesizer and electrochemical detection reader instruments and related hardware  as compared to only the and k expression arrays and dna synthesizer instruments in the comparable period 
services 
services revenues include amortization of one year equipment maintenance and service contracts executed with certain customers of our dna synthesizers for all periods presented as well as diagnostics services provided by cmdx  which began providing molecular diagnostics services in diagnostic service revenues from cmdx were  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and have increased due to the increased number of diagnostic test offerings as well as increased sales and marketing efforts at cmdx during compared to collaboration agreements 
during the third quarter of  we entered into a manufacturing agreement and completed our obligations under our collaboration agreement with furuno electric co 
furuno 
as a result  we began amortizing a million upfront payment previously received under the collaboration agreement with furuno over the economic life of the manufacturing agreement  which is estimated to be four years 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed all obligations under our collaboration and supply agreement with toppan printing ltd 
toppan and as a result  we recognized all previously deferred payments from toppan as collaboration agreement revenue totaling million in operating expenses in thousands for the years ended december  research and development expenses    research and development expenses 
the decrease in internal research and development expenses in compared to was due primarily to the impact of cost reduction efforts in the area of full time staff and ongoing research and development projects for the customarray platform  while continuing to develop microarray based diagnostics services at cmdx 
the increase in internal research and development expenses in as compared to was due primarily to costs incurred in connection with the development of higher density array products  as well as an increase in expenses incurred by our subsidiary  cmdx  which was formed and began research and development activities in the area of diagnostic applications during the second quarter of in addition  research and development expenses include million  million and in  and  respectively  of non cash stock compensation expense 
the increase in stock compensation included in research and development expenses during compared to was due primarily to a one time charge of  incurred during the third quarter of from unvested ar combimatrix stock options that became fully vested on the redemption date as a result of the split off of combimatrix from acacia 
the increase of stock compensation expense in compared to was due to our adoption of sfas no 
r effective january   as described under critical accounting policies above 
future research and development expenses will continue to be incurred in connection with our ongoing internal research and development efforts in the areas of genomics  diagnostics  drug discovery and development 
we expect our research and development expenses to continue to fluctuate and such expenses could increase in future periods as additional internal research and development agreements are undertaken and or as new research and development collaborations are executed with strategic partners 
for the years ended december  marketing  general and administrative expenses   patent amortization and royalties    legal settlement gains equity in loss of investees   goodwill impairment marketing  general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in marketing  general and administrative expenses in compared to was due primarily to a decrease in facilities related costs from executing the february  lease amendment with our landlord that significantly reduced our office space and lease rates at our mukilteo  washington location  reduction in sales and marketing staff and expenses and overall reductions in general and administrative staff  which included one time bonuses and severance related costs in the first quarter of that were not incurred in in addition  marketing  general and administrative expenses include non cash stock compensation charges credits  which were million  million and  in  and  respectively 
despite the inclusion of a one time charge of  incurred during the third quarter of from unvested ar combimatrix stock options that became fully vested on the redemption date as a result of the split off of combimatrix from acacia  marketing  general and administrative related stock compensation expense decreased in compared to due to certain employee terminations in marketing  general and administrative staff as well as existing option awards becoming fully vested during  thus resulting in overall lower stock based compensation expense in the increase in stock compensation expense in as compared to was due primarily to our adoption of sfas no 
r effective january   as described under critical accounting policies above 
excluding the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r  the increase of marketing  general and administrative expenses in compared to was due primarily to the impact of a full year of general and administrative expenses incurred by cmdx in  which commenced operations in the second quarter of  as well as increased legal and accounting expenses primarily related to the planned combimatrix split off transaction which we began to incur during included in marketing  general and administrative expenses are allocated corporate overhead charges from acacia of   and  and for  and  respectively 
refer to critical accounting policies above for a description of the management allocation policies implemented 
a summary of the primary components of the changes in marketing  general and administrative expenses for the periods presented is as follows in thousands for the years ended december  vs 
vs 
decrease in marketing and sales expense decrease in g a expenses at cbmx k 
k decrease increase in g a expenses at cmdx  decrease in administrative salaries and benefits decrease in facilities lease and related costs  increase in legal  accounting and other professional fees decrease increase in non cash stock compensation expense decrease increase in allocated overhead costs from acacia increase decrease in other g a expenses patent amortization and royalties 
patent amortization of million for the years presented relates to the amortization of our patents recognized from step acquisitions of combimatrix corporation by acacia in and  which are being amortized over a weighted average useful life of approximately years 
royalties expense of   and  for years ended december   and  respectively  relate to our september settlement agreement with nanogen  inc  and are equal to of payments made to us from sales of certain products to customers that were developed by us based on the patents that had been in dispute in the litigation with nanogen  inc prior to settlement 
the change in royalties expense for the years presented is due to the corresponding change in product revenue payments from customers 
legal settlement gains 
in connection with the september settlement agreement between combimatrix corporation  dr 
donald montgomery and nanogen  we recognized a long term liability that reflects the fair value of ar combimatrix common stock potentially issuable to nanogen in accordance with certain anti dilution provisions of the settlement agreement 
periodic charges and the related liability were estimated based on the number of shares issuable and or potentially issuable and the ar combimatrix stock price at the end of the respective reporting period 
the legal settlement gain reflected in was the result of valuing this liability to market during and does not represent cash payments to nanogen 
the anti dilution provisions of the settlement agreement expired in september and as a result  there were no legal settlement gains or since equity in loss of investees 
as december   and  we owned  and  respectively  of leuchemix inc or leuchemix  a private drug development firm  which is developing several compounds for the treatment of leukemia and other cancers 
our equity in the losses of leuchemix increased during compared to due primarily to our increased ownership in leuchemix as well as increased expenses incurred by leuchemix 
as of october  we completed our contractual commitment to increase our ownership in leuchemix 
goodwill impairment 
we recognized a charge for goodwill impairment of approximately  during the fourth quarter of  related to our advanced materials sciences and combimatrix kk reporting units 
these reporting units were tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of in connection with our annual forecasting process 
due to the lack of third party research and development funding for advanced materials sciences and declining array product sales at combimatrix kk  operating profits and cash flows were lower than expected during the preceding three quarters 
based on these trends  the operating forecasts for were revised downward  resulting in the goodwill impairment charge 
other non operating items warrant gains 
prior to the redemption date and in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and related interpretations  the outstanding ar combimatrix stock purchase warrants were classified as long term liabilities due to certain redemption provisions associated with the underlying ar combimatrix stock 
changes in the fair value of the stock purchase warrant liabilities are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
on the redemption date  all outstanding warrants to purchase ar combimatrix common stock became exercisable in combimatrix common stock  which is not subject to the redemption provisions that required liability classification of the warrants prior to the redemption date 
in accordance with eitf and related guidance  the fair value of the warrants as of the close of trading on august  the last day that the warrants were exercisable in ar combimatrix common stock of million was classified to additional paid in capital 
we do not expect to incur additional warrant gains or charges in the future for our existing common stock purchase warrants 
however  the issuance of warrants in future equity financings  should they occur  may be required to be classified as long term liabilities subject to fair value adjustments 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact in the current or prior periods 
liquidity and capital resources at december   cash  cash equivalents and available for sale short term investments totaled million  compared to million at december  working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  working capital decreased in primarily due to the reduction in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments 
the change in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december   and was comprised of the following in thousands for the years ended december  net cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities   financing activities    effect of exchange rate on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents   operating activities 
the decrease in net cash outflows from operations in compared to was due primarily to a decrease in cash operating expenses totaling million in compared to million in this decrease was due primarily to decreased research and development and general and administrative costs incurred as a result of the cost reduction efforts discussed above  as well as the net impact of the timing of the receipt of payments from customers and payments to vendors 
partially offsetting this decrease in cash operating expenses was a decrease in cash receipts from customers  which totaled million in compared to million in the primary reason for the decrease in cash receipts from customers was due to decreased cash receipts from customarray customers  which totaled million in compared to million in although product revenues were higher in as compared to  they include approximately  of previously deferred revenues that were recognized during but for which no cash was collected from the customer 
cash collections from our government contract billings were million in both and the increase in net cash outflows from operations in compared to was due primarily to an increase in cash operating expenses totaling million in compared to million in this increase was due primarily to increased research and development and general and administrative costs incurred as discussed above  as well as the net impact of the timing of the receipt of payments from customers and payments to vendors 
the increase in cash outflows from operating expenses was partially offset by an increase in cash receipts from customers  which totaled million in compared to million in the primary reason for the increase was due to increased sales and related cash receipts from customarray customers totaling million in compared to million in this increase was partially offset by decreased cash collections from our government contract billings  which were million in compared to million in investing activities 
the change in net cash flows from investing activities for all years presented was due primarily to our ongoing short term cash management activities and changes in short term investments in connection with certain financing activities discussed below 
fixed asset purchases were   and million in  and  respectively 
investments made in the preferred stock of leuchemix were  million and million in  and  respectively 
financing activities 
the change in net cash inflows from financing activities allocated to us from acacia for all periods presented was due to the completion of equity financings discussed below from the sale of ar combimatrix common stock  which raised net proceeds of approximately million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
the net cash provided by financing activities recognized in was partially offset by approximately  of commitment fees incurred 
the following discussion of specific financing transactions have been adjusted for the redemption ratio for comparability purposes 
during  our financing activities were comprised of one financing event  which occurred on may   whereby acacia executed a registered direct offering with certain directors of combimatrix corporation and other unaffiliated investors raising gross proceeds of million through the issuance of  units 
each unit consisted of one share of ar combimatrix common stock and a five year common stock warrant  for a total of  shares and warrants to purchase  shares of ar combimatrix common stock issued to investors 
each warrant entitled the holder to purchase a share of ar combimatrix stock at a price of per share 
the net proceeds from the may registered direct offering were attributed to us by acacia 
during  our financing activities were comprised primarily of financings with two separate financing institutions 
first  on june   acacia entered into a standby equity distribution agreement the seda with cornell capital partners  lp cornell  providing up to million of equity financing from cornell through the sale of up to  shares of ar combimatrix common stock through june during  we had received million in net proceeds in equity financings through the sale of  shares of ar combimatrix stock under the seda  which was subsequently cancelled in december of second  on december   acacia completed a registered direct offering with oppenheimer co  inc oppenheimer as the placement agent  raising gross proceeds of million through the issuance of  units 
each unit consisted of one share of ar combimatrix common stock and five year common stock warrants  for a total of  shares and warrants to purchase  shares of ar combimatrix common stock issued to investors 
net proceeds raised from the oppenheimer private equity financing of million were attributed to us by acacia 
during  our financing activities were comprised primarily of two financing events 
first  in july of  acacia sold  shares of ar combimatrix stock in a registered direct offering  generating net proceeds of approximately million  which were attributed to us 
second  in september of  acacia sold  shares of ar combimatrix stock and  ar combimatrix stock purchase warrants in a registered direct offering  generating net proceeds of approximately million  which were also attributed to us by acacia 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent balances  anticipated cash flows from operations and external sources of funding from the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through september of in order for us to continue to meet our cash requirements beyond this point  we will be required to obtain capital from external sources 
however  there can be no assurances that we will be able to secure additional sources of financing at times and at terms acceptable to management 
the issuance of additional equity securities will also cause dilution to our shareholders 
if external financing sources of financing are not available or are inadequate to fund our operations  management will be required to reduce our operating costs including research projects and personnel  which could jeopardize our future strategic initiatives and business plans 
for example  reductions in research and development activities and or personnel at our mukilteo  washington facility could result in the inability to invest the resources necessary to continue to develop next generation products and improve existing product lines in order to remain competitive in the marketplace  resulting in reduced revenues and cash flows from the sales of our customarray products and services 
also  reductions in operating costs at our diagnostics subsidiary in irvine  california  cmdx  should they occur  could jeopardize our ability to launch  market and sell additional products and services necessary to grow and sustain our operations and eventually achieve profitability 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  the anticipation that we will be required to obtain additional financing in the foreseeable future raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern beyond september of in addition to seeking capital from outside sources  our plans in regard to these matters include continued focus on operating cost reductions as were obtained during also  we are focusing our sales and product development efforts on our core diagnostic array platform as well as our funded research and development projects for the dod 
we maintain our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale investments in corporate notes and bonds  us government securities  auction market securities and money market funds that we believe minimize market risk and preserve principal 
as of december   our available for sale investments included million in auction market securities 
subsequent to year end  million of our auction market securities were sold at par value 
in late february and early march of  our remaining million of auction rate securities failed to settle at auction and are currently illiquid 
liquidity of these investments is subject to either a successful auction process  redemption of the investment  or a sale of the security in a secondary market 
as of december   the carrying value of these investments was equal to the fair value based on successful auctions preceding and subsequent to year end 
all of our remaining auction market securities carry at least an a credit rating and continue to earn interest at the contractual maximum rate 
the inability to liquidate the remainder of these securities in the near future could materially jeopardize our ability to execute our business strategies 
also  we cannot predict whether future auctions related these securities will be successful 
in connection with preparing our interim financial statements during  we will consider whether any future lack of liquidity in these securities has resulted in an impairment of our remaining auction market securities subsequent to december  we may also encounter unforeseen difficulties that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated 
any efforts to seek additional funding could be made through equity  debt or other external financing  and there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
our long term capital requirements will be substantial and the adequacy of available funds will depend upon many factors  including the costs of commercialization activities  including sales and marketing  manufacturing and capital equipment  our continued progress in research and development programs  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending any patents claims  should they arise  our ability to license technology  competing technological developments  the creation and formation of strategic partnerships  the costs associated with leasing and improving our irvine  california facility  and other factors that may not be within our control 
pursuant to the tax allocation agreement executed between us and acacia  we have agreed not to take certain actions for two years following the split off  unless we obtain an irs ruling or an opinion of counsel to the effect that these actions will not affect the tax free nature of the split off 
these actions include certain issuances of our stock  a liquidation or merger of our company  and dispositions of assets outside the ordinary course of our business 
if any of these transactions were to occur  the split off could be deemed to be a taxable distribution to acacia 
in particular  we have agreed to indemnify acacia for any tax resulting from an acquisition by one or more persons of a or greater interest in our company 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into off balance sheet financing arrangements  other than operating leases 
we have no significant commitments for capital expenditures in other than as set forth below  we have no committed funding or long term debt other than an insignificant amount of payments under certain capital leases for laboratory equipment 
our material known future cash commitments are as follows as of december  in thousands payments due by period and thereafter operating leases minimum royalty payments total recent accounting pronouncements refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term debt securities issued by the us treasury and by us corporations as well as auction market securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive without significantly increasing risk 
to minimize risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash  cash equivalents and available for sale short term investments in a variety of investment grade securities and with a variety of issuers  including corporate notes  commercial paper  government securities  auction market securities and money market funds 
we are exposed to liquidity and credit risk associated with our auction market securities 
in the event of a failed auction  we would not have access to these funds until a future auction is successful 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an impairment charge 
included within our investment portfolio at march   are auction market securities valued at million
