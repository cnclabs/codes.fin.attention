item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we typically experience lower gross and operating margins during winter months due to lower demand for our services and more difficult operating conditions 
additionally  our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter  a change in the demand for our services caused by severe weather conditions  increases in construction and design costs  the timing and volume of work under contract  regional or general economic conditions  the budgetary spending patterns of customers  the termination of existing agreements  losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance  a change in the mix of our customers  contracts and business  payment risk associated with the financial condition of our customers  changes in bonding and lien requirements applicable to existing and new agreements  costs we incur to support growth internally or through acquisitions or otherwise  
table of contents the timing and integration of acquisitions  and the timing and magnitude of acquisition integration costs and potential goodwill impairments 
accordingly  our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that you can expect for any other quarter or for the entire year 
we incurred substantial transaction and merger related costs in connection with the merger and we may not realize all of the anticipated synergies and other benefits from acquiring infrasource 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of non recurring transaction and merger related costs associated with completing the merger with infrasource  combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies 
these fees and costs may be significant 
additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of quanta and infrasource 
although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs  as well as the realization of other efficiencies  related to the integration of the two businesses will offset the incremental transaction and merger related costs over time  this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term  or at all 
the success of the merger will depend  in part  on our ability to realize the synergies and other benefits from acquiring infrasource 
to realize these synergies and benefits  however  we must successfully integrate the operations and personnel of infrasource into our business 
we have made substantial progress toward the integration of the two companies  but if this integration is unsuccessful  the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all  may take longer or cost more to realize than expected 
because we and infrasource have previously operated as independent companies  it is possible that integration will result in the future loss of valuable employees  the disruption of our business or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures  practices  policies and compensation arrangements 
the size of the merger may also make integration difficult  expensive and disruptive  adversely affecting our revenues and earnings 
as a result of the merger with infrasource  we are subject to additional risks 
as a result of the merger  our results of operations could be adversely affected by any issues attributable to infrasource s operations that arose prior to the closing of the merger  including issues with respect to infrasource projects that may decrease our profitability or result in litigation 
furthermore  to the extent that infrasource had or is perceived by customers to have had operational challenges  such as on time performance  safety issues or workforce issues  those challenges may raise concerns by our customers  which may limit or impede our future ability to obtain additional work from those customers 
quanta and infrasource also had some customer overlap prior to the merger 
if any of these customers in common decrease their amount of business with us to reduce their reliance on a single company  such decrease in business could adversely impact our sales and profitability 
infrasource  certain of its officers and directors and various other parties  including david r 
helwig  the former chief executive officer of infrasource  who became a director of quanta after completion of the merger  are defendants in a lawsuit seeking unspecified damages filed in the state district court in harris county  texas 
the plaintiffs allege that the defendants violated their fiduciary duties and committed constructive fraud by failing to maximize shareholder value in connection with certain acquisitions by infrasource incorporated that closed in and and the acquisition of infrasource incorporated by infrasource in and committed other acts of misconduct following the filing of the petition 
the parties agreed to settle this lawsuit in january and agreed to a dismissal of all material claims  although the dismissal has not yet been ordered by the court 
an economic downturn may lead to less demand for our services 
because the vast majority of our revenue is derived from a few industries  a downturn in any of those industries would adversely affect our results of operations 
the telecommunications and utility markets experienced substantial change during and as evidenced by an increased number of bankruptcies in the telecommunications market  continued devaluation of many of our customers debt and equity securities and pricing pressures resulting from challenges faced by major industry participants 
these factors contributed 
table of contents to the delay and cancellation of projects and reduction of capital spending  which impacted our operations and our ability to grow at historical levels 
a number of other factors  including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve or a prolonged economic recession  could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future or pay for past services 
additionally  our gas distribution installation business is driven in part by the housing construction market  and continued declines in new housing construction could cause reductions in our gas distribution installation business 
consolidation  competition or capital constraints in the electric power  gas  telecommunications or cable television industries may also result in reduced spending by  or the loss of  one or more of our customers 
project delays or cancellations may result in additional costs to us  reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated damages 
in certain circumstances  we guarantee project completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels 
failure to meet any of those schedules or performance requirements could result in additional costs or penalties  including liquidated damages  and such amounts could exceed expected project profit 
many projects involve challenging engineering  procurement and construction phases that may occur over extended time periods  sometimes up to two years 
we may encounter difficulties in engineering  delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party  equipment and material delivery  schedule changes  weather related delays and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  that impact our ability to complete the project in accordance with the original delivery schedule 
for example  the recent increase in demand for transmission services has strained production resources  creating significant lead times for obtaining large transformers  transmission towers and poles 
as a result  electric transmission project revenues could be significantly reduced or delayed due to the difficulty we or our customers may experience in obtaining required materials 
in addition  we occasionally contract with third party subcontractors to assist us with the completion of contracts 
any delay by suppliers or by subcontractors in the completion of their portion of the project  or any failure by a subcontractor to satisfactorily complete its portion of the project may result in delays in the overall progress of the project or may cause us to incur additional costs  or both 
we also may encounter project delays due to local opposition  which may include injunctive actions as well as public protests  to the siting of transmission lines or other facilities 
delays and additional costs may be substantial and  in some cases  we may be required to compensate the customer for such delays 
we may not be able to recover all of such costs 
in extreme cases  the above mentioned factors could cause project cancellations  and we may not be able to replace such projects with similar projects or at all 
such delays or cancellations may impact our reputation or relationships with customers  adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts 
project contracts may require customers or other parties to provide design  engineering information  equipment or materials to be used on a project 
in some cases  the project schedule or the design  engineering information  equipment or materials may be deficient or delivered later than required by the project schedule 
our customers may change various elements of the project after its commencement 
under these circumstances  we generally negotiate with the customer with respect to the amount of additional time required and the compensation to be paid to us 
we are subject to the risk that we may be unable to obtain  through negotiation  arbitration  litigation or otherwise  adequate amounts to compensate us for the additional work or expenses incurred by us due to customer requested change orders or failure by the customer to timely deliver items  such as engineering drawings or materials  required to be provided by the customer 
a failure to obtain adequate compensation for these matters could require us to record a reduction to amounts of revenue and gross profit recognized in prior periods under the percentage of completion accounting method 
any such adjustments could be substantial 
our dependence upon fixed price contracts could adversely affect our business 
we currently generate  and expect to continue to generate  a portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts 
we must estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for fixed price contracts 
the actual cost of labor and materials  however  may vary from the costs we originally estimated 
these variations  
table of contents along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts  may cause actual revenue and gross profits for a project to differ from those we originally estimated and could result in reduced profitability or losses on projects 
depending upon the size of a particular project  variations from the estimated contract costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
our use of percentage of completion accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits 
as discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item hereof  a significant portion of our revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting  utilizing the cost to cost method 
this method is used because management considers expended costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
this accounting method is generally accepted for fixed price contracts 
the percentage of completion accounting practice we use results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability 
contract losses are recognized in full when determined  and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability 
further  a substantial portion of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives 
penalties are recorded when known or finalized  which generally occurs during the latter stages of the contract 
in addition  we record cost recovery claims when we believe recovery is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
actual collection of claims could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings 
in certain circumstances  it is possible that such adjustments could be significant 
we may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth 
our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by  among other factors  our ability to expand the range of services we offer to customers to address their evolving network needs  attract new customers  increase the number of projects performed for existing customers  hire and retain qualified employees  and expand geographically  including internationally 
in addition  our customers may delay or reduce the number or size of projects available to us due to their inability to obtain capital or pay for services provided 
many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control  and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth 
if we are unsuccessful  we may not be able to achieve internal growth  expand our operations or grow our business 
our industry is highly competitive 
our industry is served by numerous small  owner operated private companies  a few public companies and several large regional companies 
in addition  relatively few barriers prevent entry into some of our industries 
as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become one of our competitors 
competition in the industry depends on a number of factors  including price 
certain of our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures and  therefore  may be able to provide their services at lower rates than we are able to provide 
in addition  some of our competitors have significant resources including financial  technical and marketing resources 
we cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise  experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services 
similarly  we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or 
table of contents enhance our competitive position within our industry or maintain our customer base at current levels 
we also may face competition from the in house service organizations of our existing or prospective customers 
electric power  gas  telecommunications and cable television service providers usually employ personnel who perform some of the same types of services we do 
we cannot be certain that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource services in the future 
the energy policy act of may fail to result in increased spending on the electric power transmission infrastructure 
implementation of the energy act is still subject to considerable fiscal and regulatory uncertainty 
regulations implementing the components of the energy act that may affect demand for our services have only recently been finalized and in some cases remain subject to challenge before the department of energy and in the federal courts 
accordingly  the effect of these regulations  once finally implemented  is uncertain 
as a result  the legislation may not result in increased spending on the electric power transmission infrastructure 
continued uncertainty regarding the implementation of the energy act may result in slower growth in demand for our services 
our business is labor intensive  and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees 
our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will be limited by our ability to employ  train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy 
for instance  we may experience shortages of qualified journeyman linemen 
in addition  we cannot be certain that our labor expenses will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel 
labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues 
our business growth could outpace the capability of our corporate management infrastructure 
we cannot be certain that our infrastructure will be adequate to support our operations as they expand 
future growth also could impose significant additional responsibilities on members of our senior management  including the need to recruit and integrate new senior level managers and executives 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit and retain such additional managers and executives 
to the extent that we are unable to manage our growth effectively  or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified management  we may not be able to expand our operations or execute our business plan 
factors beyond our control may affect our ability to successfully execute our acquisition strategy  which may have an adverse impact on our growth strategy 
our business strategy includes expanding our presence in the industries we serve through strategic acquisitions of companies that complement or enhance our business 
we expect to face competition for acquisition opportunities  and some of our competitors may have access to financing on more favorable terms than us or have greater financial resources 
this competition may limit our acquisition opportunities and our ability to grow through acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions and make them less accretive or possibly non accretive to us 
acquisitions that we may pursue may also involve significant cash expenditures  debt incurrence or the issuance of securities 
any acquisition may ultimately have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be unsuccessful at integrating companies that either we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future 
as a part of our business strategy  we have acquired  and seek to acquire in the future  companies that complement or enhance our business 
however  we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully integrate each of these companies with our existing operations without substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial problems 
if we do not implement proper overall business controls  our decentralized 
table of contents operating strategy could result in inconsistent operating and financial practices at the companies we acquire and our overall profitability could be adversely affected 
integrating our acquired companies involves a number of special risks which could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including failure of acquired companies to achieve the results we expect  diversion of our management s attention from operational and other matters  difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies  inability to retain key personnel of acquired companies  risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities  and potential disruptions of our business 
if one of our acquired companies suffers customer dissatisfaction or performance problems  the reputation of our entire company could suffer 
our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of goodwill impairments 
when we acquire a business  we record an asset called goodwill equal to the excess amount we pay for the business  including liabilities assumed  over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of the business we acquire 
for example  in connection with the merger  we recorded approximately million in goodwill and million of intangible assets based on the application of purchase accounting 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized  but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  and intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other non amortized intangible assets for impairment 
sfas no 
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions when allocating goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of reporting unit net assets and liabilities  including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected cash flows  investment rates  cost of capital and growth rates  which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
fair value is determined using a combination of the discounted cash flow  market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches 
absent any impairment indicators  we perform our impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter 
as part of our annual test for goodwill impairment  goodwill in the amount of million was written off as a non cash operating expense associated with a decrease in the expected future demand for the services of one of our businesses  which has historically served the cable television industry 
any future impairments  including impairments of the goodwill or intangible assets recorded in connection with the merger  would negatively impact our results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recognized 
our financial results are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  several estimates and assumptions are used by management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date of the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events  cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies 
in some cases  these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment 
estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventory  useful lives of property and equipment  fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill and long lived asset impairments  self insured claims liabilities  forfeiture estimates relating to stock based compensation  revenue recognition under percentage of completion accounting and provision for income taxes 
actual results for all 
table of contents estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
during the ordinary course of our business  we may become subject to lawsuits or indemnity claims  which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we have in the past been  and may in the future be  named as a defendant in lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings during the ordinary course of our business 
these actions may seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  workers compensation  employment discrimination  breach of contract  property damage  punitive damages  civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief 
in addition  we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts with them  and  in some instances  we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for actions by our customers or other third parties 
because our services in certain instances may be integral to the operation and performance of our customers infrastructure  we may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the systems that we work on  even if our services are not the cause of such failures  and we could be subject to civil and criminal liabilities to the extent that our services contributed to any property damage  personal injury or system failure 
the outcome of any of these lawsuits  claims or legal proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of management s attention to the business 
payments of significant amounts  even if reserved  could adversely affect our reputation  liquidity and results of operations 
we are self insured against potential liabilities 
although we maintain insurance policies with respect to employer s liability  general liability  automobile and workers compensation claims  those policies are subject to deductibles ranging from million to million per occurrence depending on the insurance policy 
we are primarily self insured for all claims that do not exceed the amount of the applicable deductible 
additionally  we are subject to an annual cumulative aggregate liability of up to million on workers compensation claims in excess of million per occurrence 
we also have an employee health care benefits plan for employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements  which was subject to a deductible of  per claimant per year until december  the deductible for employee health care benefits was increased to  per claimant per year effective january  effective upon the merger  infrasource became insured under quanta s property and casualty insurance program 
previously  infrasource was insured for workers compensation  general liability and employer s liability  each subject to a deductible of million per occurrence 
infrasource was also insured for auto liability  subject to a deductible of million per occurrence 
infrasource continued to operate its own health plan for employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements through december   which was subject to a deductible of  per claimant per year 
losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported  with assistance from third party actuaries 
however  insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
the accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends and management believes such accruals to be adequate 
if we were to experience insurance claims or costs significantly above our estimates  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in a given period 
our casualty insurance carrier for prior periods is experiencing financial distress  which may require us to make payments for losses that otherwise would be insured 
our casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods from august  to february  is experiencing financial distress  but is currently paying valid claims 
in the event that this insurer s financial situation deteriorates  we may be required to pay certain obligations that otherwise would have been paid by 
table of contents this insurer 
we estimate that the total future claim amount that this insurer is currently obligated to pay on our behalf for the above mentioned policy periods is approximately million  however  our estimate of the potential range of these future claim amounts is between million and million 
the actual amounts ultimately paid by us related to these claims  if any  may vary materially from the above range and could be impacted by further claims development and the extent to which the insurer can not honor its obligations 
in any event  we do not expect any failure by this insurer to honor its obligations to us to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition  however  the impact could be material to our results of operations or cash flow in a given period 
we may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impact relating to occupational health and safety matters 
our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace 
while we have invested  and will continue to invest  substantial resources in our occupational health and safety programs  our industry involves a high degree of operational risk and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability exposure 
although we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions  we have suffered fatalities in the past and may suffer additional fatalities in the future 
claims for damages to persons  including claims for bodily injury or loss of life  could result in substantial costs and liabilities 
in addition  if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time  our customers could cancel our contracts and not award us future business 
our profitability and financial operations may be negatively affected by changes in  or interpretations of  existing state or federal telecommunications regulations or new regulations that could adversely affect our dark fiber leasing business 
in connection with the merger  we acquired infrasource s dark fiber leasing business 
many of the dark fiber customers benefit from the universal service e rate program  which was established by congress in the telecommunications act and is administered by the universal service administrative company the usac under the oversight of the federal communications commission fcc 
under the e rate program  schools  libraries and certain health care facilities may receive subsidies for certain approved telecommunications services  internet access and internal connections 
from time to time  bills have been introduced in congress that would eliminate or curtail the e rate program 
passage of such actions by the fcc or usac to further limit e rate subsidies could decrease the demand for telecommunications infrastructure service by certain customers 
the telecommunications services we provide through our dark fiber leasing business are subject to regulation by the fcc  to the extent that they are interstate telecommunications services  and by state regulatory agencies  when wholly within a particular state 
to remain eligible to provide services under the e rate program  we must maintain telecommunications authorizations in every state where we operate 
changes in federal or state regulations could reduce the profitability of our dark fiber leasing business 
we could be subject to fines if the fcc or a state regulatory agency were to determine that any of our activities or positions are not in compliance with certain regulations 
if the profitability of our dark fiber leasing business were to decline  or if this business were to become subject to fines  our profitability and results of operations could also be adversely affected 
our dark fiber leasing business is capital intensive and requires a substantial investment before returns can be realized 
our dark fiber leasing business requires substantial amounts of capital investment to build out new fiber networks 
in  our proposed capital expenditures for our dark fiber leasing business is approximately million  with another million estimated to be expended in although we do not commit capital to new networks until we have a committed lease arrangement in place with at least one customer  we may not be able to recoup our initial investment in the network if that customer defaults on its commitment 
even if the customer does not default or we add additional customers to the network  we still may not realize a return on the capital investment for an extended period of time 
additionally  new or developing technologies 
table of contents could negatively impact our dark fiber leasing business 
if any of the above events occur  it could result in an impairment of our dark fiber network 
many of our contracts may be canceled on short notice or may not be renewed upon completion or expiration  and we may be unsuccessful in replacing our contracts in such events 
we could experience a decrease in our revenue  net income and liquidity if any of the following occur our customers cancel a significant number of contracts or contracts having significant value  we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re bid  we complete a significant number of non recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects  or we fail to reduce operating and overhead expenses consistent with any decrease in our revenue 
many of our customers may cancel our contracts on short notice  typically days  even if we are not in default under the contract 
certain of our customers assign work to us on a project by project basis under master service agreements 
under these agreements  our customers often have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us 
our operations could decline significantly if the anticipated volume of work is not assigned to us 
many of our contracts  including our master service agreements  are opened to public bid at the expiration of their terms 
there can be no assurance that we will be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that come up for re bid 
backlog may not be realized or may not result in profits 
backlog is difficult to determine with certainty 
customers often have no obligation under our contracts to assign or release work to us  and many contracts may be terminated on short notice 
reductions in backlog due to cancellation by a customer or for other reasons could significantly reduce the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts included in backlog 
in the event of a project cancellation  we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog 
the backlog we obtain in connection with any companies we acquire  including infrasource  may not be as large as we believed or may not result in the revenue or profits we expected 
in addition  projects may remain in backlog for extended periods of time 
consequently  we cannot assure you as to our customers requirements or that our estimates are accurate 
we extend credit to customers for purchases of our services  and in the past we have had  and in the future we may have  difficulty collecting receivables from major customers that have filed bankruptcy or are otherwise experiencing financial difficulties 
we grant credit  generally without collateral  to our customers  which include electric power and gas companies  telecommunications and cable television system operators  governmental entities  general contractors  and builders  owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the united states 
consequently  we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the united states 
in the past  our customers in the telecommunications business have experienced significant financial difficulties and in several instances have filed for bankruptcy 
a number of our utility customers have also experienced business challenges in the past 
if additional major customers file for bankruptcy or continue to experience financial difficulties  or if anticipated recoveries relating to receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations fail to materialize  we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current allowances provided 
in addition  material changes in any of our customer s revenues or cash flows could affect our ability to collect amounts due from them 

table of contents a portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds 
we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects if we are not able to obtain the necessary surety bonds 
current or future market conditions  including losses incurred in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate bankruptcies  as well as changes in our surety s assessment of our operating and financial risk  could cause our surety providers to decline to issue or renew  or substantially reduce the amount of  bonds for our work and could increase our bonding costs 
these actions could be taken on short notice 
if our surety providers were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding  our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other sureties  finding more business that does not require bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance  such as letters of credit or cash 
we may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner  on acceptable terms  or at all  which could affect our ability to bid for or work on future projects requiring financial assurances 
we have also granted security interests in various of our assets to collateralize our obligations to the surety 
furthermore  under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue or continue bonds on a project by project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds 
if we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or any other reasons  we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects that would require bonding 
the departure of key personnel could disrupt our business 
we depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and on senior management of our operating units  including the businesses we acquire 
although we have entered into employment agreements with terms of one to three years with most of our executive officers and certain other key employees  we cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees  could negatively impact our ability to manage our business 
we do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees 
our unionized workforce could adversely affect our operations and our ability to complete future acquisitions 
as of december   approximately of our hourly employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
although the majority of these agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages  we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future 
strikes or work stoppages would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease our revenue 
additionally  these agreements may require us to participate with other companies in multi employer pension plans 
to the extent those plans are underfunded  the employee retirement income security act of  as amended by the multi employer pension plan amendments act of  may subject us to substantial liabilities under those plans if we withdraw from them or they are terminated 
furthermore  the pension protection act of added new funding rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after for multi employer plans that are classified as endangered  seriously endangered  or critical status 
for a plan in critical status  additional required contributions and benefit reductions apply  however  we are not currently aware of any multi employer plan to which any of our subsidiaries contributes being in critical status 
our ability to complete future acquisitions could be adversely affected because of our union status for a variety of reasons 
for instance  our union agreements may be incompatible with the union agreements of a business we want to acquire and some businesses may not want to become affiliated with a union based company 
additionally  we may increase our exposure to withdrawal liabilities for underfunded multi employer pension plans to which an acquired company contributes 
we may not be successful in continuing to meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of has introduced many requirements applicable to us regarding corporate governance and financial reporting  including the requirements for management to report on our internal 
table of contents controls over financial reporting and for our independent registered public accounting firm to express an opinion over the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
during  we continued actions to ensure our ability to comply with these requirements 
as of december   our internal control over financial reporting was effective  however  there can be no assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in future years 
in accordance with sec guidance  our assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include infrasource  which will be included in future assessments 
failure to maintain effective internal controls or the identification of significant internal control deficiencies in infrasource or other acquisitions made during or in the future could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock and our other publicly traded securities  the reduced ability to obtain financing  the loss of customers  penalties and additional expenditures to meet the requirements 
our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  including those dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products  pcbs  fuel storage and air quality 
we perform work in many different types of underground environments 
if the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate  or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps  our underground work could strike objects in the soil  some of which may contain pollutants 
these objects may also rupture  resulting in the discharge of pollutants 
in such circumstances  we may be liable for fines and damages  and we may be unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties providing the incorrect information 
in addition  we perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies 
due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies  it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture  resulting in the release of subsurface materials 
these subsurface materials may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law  potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines 
we also own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment 
some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks which are above or below ground 
if these tanks were to leak  we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks  or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
in certain instances  we have obtained indemnification or covenants from third parties including predecessors or lessors for such cleanup and other obligations and liabilities that we believe are adequate to cover such obligations and liabilities 
however  such third party indemnities or covenants may not cover all of our costs  and such unanticipated obligations or liabilities  or future obligations and liabilities  may have a material adverse effect on our business operations or financial condition 
further  we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities relating to any acquired business 
risks associated with operating in international markets could restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business and prospects 
while only a small percentage of our revenue is currently derived from international markets  we hope to continue to expand the volume of services that we provide internationally 
we presently conduct our international sales efforts in canada  mexico and selected countries overseas  but expect that the number of countries that we operate in could expand significantly over the next few years 
economic conditions  including those resulting from wars  civil unrest  acts of terrorism and other conflicts  may adversely affect the global economy  our customers and their ability to pay for our services 
in addition  there are numerous risks inherent in conducting our business internationally  including  but not limited to  potential instability in international markets  changes in regulatory requirements applicable to international operations  currency fluctuations in foreign countries  political  economic and social conditions in foreign countries and complex us and foreign laws and treaties  including tax laws and the us foreign corrupt practices act 
these risks 
table of contents could restrict our ability to provide services to international customers and could adversely affect our ability to operate our business profitably 
opportunities within the government arena could lead to increased governmental regulation applicable to us and unrecoverable start up costs 
most government contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding process 
as we pursue increased opportunities in the government arena  management s focus associated with the start up and bidding process may be diverted away from other opportunities 
if we were to be successful in being awarded government contracts  a significant amount of costs could be required before any revenues were realized from these contracts 
in addition  as a government contractor  we would be subject to a number of procurement rules and other public sector liabilities  any deemed violation of which could lead to fines or penalties or a loss of business 
government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors 
government agencies may review a contractor s performance under its contracts  cost structure  and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
if government agencies determine through these audits or reviews that costs were improperly allocated to specific contracts  they will not reimburse the contractor for those costs or may require the contractor to refund previously reimbursed costs 
if government agencies determine that we engaged in improper activity  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties 
in addition  if the government were to even allege improper activity  we also could experience serious harm to our reputation 
many government contracts must be appropriated each year 
if appropriations are not made in subsequent years we would not realize all of the potential revenues from any awarded contracts 
the industries we serve are subject to rapid technological and structural changes that could reduce the demand for the services we provide 
the electric power  gas  telecommunications and cable television industries are undergoing rapid change as a result of technological advances that could  in certain cases  reduce the demand for our services  impair the value of our dark fiber network or otherwise negatively impact our business 
new or developing technologies could displace the wireline systems used for voice  video and data transmissions  and improvements in existing technology may allow telecommunications and cable television companies to significantly improve their networks without physically upgrading them 
we may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth and operations 
if we cannot secure additional financing in the future on acceptable terms  we may be unable to support our growth strategy or future operations 
we cannot readily predict the ability of certain customers to pay for past services or the timing  size and success of our acquisition efforts 
using cash for acquisitions limits our financial flexibility and makes us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings 
our existing debt agreements contain significant restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility  including our ability to incur additional debt or conduct equity financings  and if we seek more debt we may have to agree to additional covenants that limit our operational and financial flexibility 
when we seek additional debt or equity financings  we cannot be certain that additional debt or equity will be available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all 
furthermore  our credit facility has commitments from several banks 
with the current turbulent credit markets resulting from  among other factors  losses from the sub prime mortgage crisis  banks may become more restrictive in their lending practices or unable to fund their commitments  which may limit our access to the capital needed to fund our growth and operations 
our convertible subordinated notes are presently convertible or may be convertible in the future  which  if converted  may result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders  lower prevailing market prices for our common stock or cause a significant cash outlay 
as a result of our common stock satisfying the market price condition of our convertible subordinated notes  our convertible subordinated notes due notes were convertible at the option of the holder during each quarter of and  and our convertible subordinated notes due notes were convertible at the option of the holders during the third quarter of during 
table of contents  in aggregate principal amount of the notes were settled in cash upon conversion by the holders 
the remaining notes are presently convertible at the option of each holder  and the conversion period will expire on march   but may continue or resume in future periods upon the satisfaction of the market price condition or other conditions 
the notes are not presently convertible  but may resume convertibility in future periods upon satisfaction of the market price condition or other conditions 
at any time on or after october   we may redeem for cash some or all of the notes at the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
the holders of the notes that are called for redemption will have the right to convert all or some of their notes 
we have the right to deliver shares of our common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock upon a conversion of the notes 
the number of shares issuable upon conversion will be determined based on a conversion rate of approximately per share for the notes and approximately for the notes 
in the event that all notes were converted for common stock  we would issue an aggregate of million shares of our common stock 
in the event that all notes were converted for common stock  we would issue an aggregate of million shares of our common stock 
the conversion of some or all of our or notes into our common stock could cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issued upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the possibility that the notes may be converted may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock 
if we elect to satisfy the conversion obligation in cash  the amount of cash payable upon conversion of the notes will be determined by the product of i the number of shares issuable for the principal amount of the converted notes at a conversion rate of approximately per share for the notes and approximately per share for the notes and ii the average closing price of our common stock during a day trading period following the holders unretracted election to convert the notes 
to the extent we decide to pay cash to settle any conversions and the average closing price of our common stock during this period exceeds per share for the notes or for the notes  we would have to pay cash in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted  which would result in the recording of a loss on extinguishment of debt 
on october   the holders of the notes may elect repayment  which would require us to pay  in cash  the aggregate principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  of the notes held by the holders who elect repayment 
as a result of the holders repayment right  we reclassified the million aggregate principal amount outstanding of the notes into a current obligation in october currently  our common stock price exceeds the conversion price 
if our common stock price exceeds the conversion price in october  it is not likely that any holder of the notes will elect repayment on october   but it is likely that if we were to redeem the notes on or after october   the holders of the notes subject to redemption would convert their notes 
on the other hand  if our common stock price is below the conversion price  it is more likely that the holders of the notes would elect repayment or would not convert upon a redemption 
we have not yet determined whether we will use cash on hand  issue equity or incur additional debt to fund our cash obligation if we are required to repay or determine to redeem the notes 
we have also not yet determined whether we will settle any conversion obligation with respect to the notes in shares of our common stock  cash or a combination thereof 
certain provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult 
the following provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as currently in effect  as well as our stockholder rights plan and delaware law  could discourage potential proposals to acquire us  delay or 
table of contents prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock and to adopt amendments to our bylaws  our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to act by written consent  we are subject to provisions of delaware law which prohibit us from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such stockholder became classified as an interested stockholder  and we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that could cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors or permitted by the stockholder rights plan
