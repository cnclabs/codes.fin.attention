please see risk factors  above  and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report  and the notes thereto 
we have rounded amounts reported here to the nearest thousand  unless such amounts are more than million  in which event we have rounded such amounts to the nearest hundred thousand 
general we are a defense and security products and services company  engaged in three business areas interactive simulation for military  law enforcement and commercial markets  batteries and charging systems for the military  and high level armoring for military  paramilitary and commercial vehicles 
we operate in three business units we develop  manufacture and market advanced high tech multimedia and interactive digital solutions for use of force and driving training of military  law enforcement  security and other personnel our training and simulation division  we provide aviation armor kits and we utilize sophisticated lightweight materials and advanced engineering processes to armor vehicles our armoring division  and we develop  manufacture and market primary zinc air batteries  rechargeable batteries and battery chargers for defense and security products and other military applications our battery and power systems division 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for bad debts  inventory  contingencies and warranty reserves  impairment of intangible assets and goodwill 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
under different assumptions or conditions  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the recognition of revenue in any accounting period 
material differences in the amount of revenue in any given period may result if these judgments or estimates prove to be incorrect or if management s estimates change on the basis of development of the business or market conditions 
management judgments and estimates have been applied consistently and have been reliable historically 
a portion of our revenue is derived from license agreements that entail the customization of faac s simulators to the customer s specific requirements 
revenues from initial license fees for such arrangements are recognized in accordance with statement of position accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts based on the percentage of completion method over the period from signing of the license through to customer acceptance  as such simulators require significant modification or customization that takes time to complete 
the percentage of completion is measured by monitoring progress using records of actual time incurred to date in the project compared with the total estimated project requirement  which corresponds to the costs related to earned revenues 
estimates of total project requirements are based on prior experience of customization  delivery and acceptance of the same or similar technology and are reviewed and updated regularly by management 
we believe that the use of the percentage of completion method is appropriate as we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs 
in addition  contracts executed include provisions that clearly specify the enforceable rights regarding services to be provided and received by the parties to the contracts  the consideration to be exchanged and the manner and terms of settlement 
in all cases we expect to perform our contractual obligations and our licensees are expected to satisfy their obligations under the contract 
the complexity of the estimation process and the issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and specification and testing requirement changes 
we account for our other revenues from ies simulators in accordance with the provisions of sop  software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants and as amended by sop and sop and related interpretations 
we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software license and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
we assess whether collection is probable at the time of the transaction based on a number of factors  including the customer s past transaction history and credit worthiness 
if we determine that the collection of the fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
stock based compensation we account for stock options and awards issued to employees in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under sfas no 
r  stock based awards to employees are required to be recognized as compensation expense  based on the calculated fair value on the date of grant 
we determine the fair value using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires subjective assumptions  including future stock price volatility and expected term  which affect the calculated values 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding receivables 
in determining the provision  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
we reassess these allowances each accounting period 
historically  our actual losses and credits have been consistent with these provisions 
if actual payment experience with our customers is different than our estimates  adjustments to these allowances may be necessary resulting in additional charges to our statement of operations 
accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax expense provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters may be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income loss in the period in which such determination is made 
we have provided a valuation allowance on the majority of our net deferred tax assets  which includes federal and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes statement  involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a valuation allowance was required  we primarily considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses in certain jurisdictions and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
we provide valuation allowances in respect of deferred tax assets resulting principally from the carryforward of tax losses 
management currently believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax regarding the carryforward of losses and certain accrued expenses will not be realized in the foreseeable future 
we do not provide for us federal income taxes on the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are re invested and  in the opinion of management  will continue to be re invested indefinitely 
on january   we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board interpretation no  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of statement fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return 
we must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
once it is determined that a position meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
fin applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to statement uncertain tax positions require determinations and estimated liabilities to be made based on provisions of the tax law which may be subject to change or varying interpretation 
if our determinations and estimates prove to be inaccurate  the resulting adjustments could be material to its future financial results 
based on the analysis performed  we did not record any unrecognized tax positions as of december  in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and may be subject to audits in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues that may require an extended period of time for resolution 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
inventories our policy for valuation of inventory and commitments to purchase inventory  including the determination of obsolete or excess inventory  requires us to perform a detailed assessment of inventory at each balance sheet date  which includes a review of  among other factors  an estimate of future demand for products within specific time horizons  valuation of existing inventory  as well as product lifecycle and product development plans 
the estimates of future demand that we use in the valuation of inventory are the basis for our revenue forecast  which is also used for our short term manufacturing plans 
inventory reserves are also provided to cover risks arising from slow moving items 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we may be required to record additional inventory write down if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by our management 
for fiscal  no significant changes were made to the underlying assumptions related to estimates of inventory valuation or the methodology applied 
goodwill under financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests based on estimated fair value in accordance with sfas we determine fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis 
this type of analysis requires us to make assumptions and estimates regarding industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as future expectations 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill  we may be required to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
this process is subjective and requires judgment at many points throughout the analysis 
if our estimates or their related assumptions change in subsequent periods or if actual cash flows are below our estimates  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
other intangible assets other intangible assets are amortized to the statement of operations over the period during which benefits are expected to accrue  currently estimated at two to ten years 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires us to make assumptions regarding future business conditions and operating results in order to estimate future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we could be required to record additional impairment charges 
contingencies we are from time to time involved in legal proceedings and other claims 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to establish our self insured liabilities during the past three fiscal years 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for any contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change due to future developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in the settlement strategy in dealing with any contingencies  which may result in higher net loss 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments  we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
warranty reserves upon shipment of products to our customers  we provide for the estimated cost to repair or replace products that may be returned under warranty 
our warranty period is typically twelve months from the date of shipment to the end user customer 
for existing products  the reserve is estimated based on actual historical experience 
for new products  the warranty reserve is based on historical experience of similar products until such time as sufficient historical data has been collected on the new product 
factors that may impact our warranty costs in the future include our reliance on our contract manufacturer to provide quality products and the fact that our products are complex and may contain undetected defects  errors or failures in either the hardware or the software 
functional currency we consider the united states dollar to be the currency of the primary economic environment in which we and our israeli subsidiary efl operate and  therefore  both we and efl have adopted and are using the united states dollar as our functional currency 
transactions and balances originally denominated in us dollars are presented at the original amounts 
gains and losses arising from non dollar transactions and balances are included in net income 
the majority of financial transactions of our israeli subsidiaries mdt and epsilor is in new israel shekels nis and a substantial portion of mdt s and epsilor s costs is incurred in nis 
management believes that the nis is the functional currency of mdt and epsilor 
accordingly  the financial statements of mdt and epsilor have been translated into us dollars 
all balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
statement of operations amounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
recent developments purchase of the minority interest in mdt israel and mdt armor in january  we purchased the minority shareholder s interest in mdt israel and the interest in mdt armor  as well as settling all outstanding disputes regarding severance payments  in exchange for a total of million 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this transaction on our first quarter financial statements 
purchase of realtime technologies  inc in february our faac subsidiary acquired realtime technologies  inc rti  a privately owned corporation headquartered in royal oak  michigan  close to the headquarters of the rest of our training and simulation division  for a total of   in cash and  in stock with a earn out maximum of  based on net profit 
since its founding in  rti has specialized in multi body vehicle dynamics modeling and graphical simulation solutions 
rti offers simulation software applications  consulting services  custom engineering solutions  and software and hardware development 
aoa arbitration in connection with our acquisition of aoa  we had a contingent earnout obligation in an amount equal to the revenues aoa realized from certain specific programs that were identified by us and the seller of aoa seller as appropriate targets for revenue increases 
as of december   we had reduced the million escrow held by the seller by  for a putative claim against such escrow in respect of such earn out obligation 
on march   we filed a demand for arbitration with the american arbitration association against the seller 
in our demand  we sought the return of million  plus interest  held in escrow by the seller in connection with his sale of aoa to us in the seller asserted counterclaims against us in the arbitration  alleging i that he is entitled to keep the million  ii that he is entitled to an additional million in post sale earnouts  and iii that he is entitled to  in compensation plus interest and statutory penalties wrongfully withheld by us when we constructively terminated his employment 
in february  the arbitration panel issued a decision denying the seller s counterclaims i and ii above  granting the seller s counterclaim for  in compensation  awarding us the entire million escrow less the  in compensation with simple interest but without statutory penalties  and awarding us  in attorneys fees 
the time for the seller to move to vacate or modify this award has not yet expired 
executive summary overview of results of operations we incurred significant operating losses for the years ended december  and while we expect to continue to derive revenues from the sale of products that we manufacture and the services that we provide  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability on a consistent basis 
a portion of our operating loss during and arose as a result of non cash charges 
these charges were primarily related to our acquisitions  financings and issuances of restricted shares and options to employees 
to the extent that we continue certain of these activities during  we would expect to continue to incur such non cash charges in the future 
acquisitions in acquisition of subsidiaries  part of the purchase price is allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
amortization of intangible assets related to acquisition of subsidiaries is recorded based on the estimated expected life of the assets 
accordingly  for a period of time following an acquisition  we incur a non cash charge related to amortization of intangible assets in the amount of a fraction based on the useful life of the intangible assets of the amount recorded as intangible assets 
such amortization charges continued during we are required to review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if we determine  through the impairment review process  that intangible asset has been impaired  we must record the impairment charge in our statement of operations 
in the case of goodwill  the assets recorded as goodwill are not amortized  instead  we are required to perform an annual impairment review 
if we determine  through the impairment review process  that goodwill has been impaired  we must record the impairment charge in our statement of operations 
as a result of the application of the above accounting rule  we incurred non cash charges for amortization of intangible assets in and in the amount of million and million  respectively 
financings and issuances of restricted shares  options and warrants the non cash charges that relate to our financings occurred in connection with our issuance of convertible securities with warrants  and in connection with our repricing of certain warrants and grants of new warrants 
when we issue convertible securities  we record a discount for a beneficial conversion feature that is amortized ratably over the life of the debenture 
when a debenture is converted  however  the entire remaining unamortized beneficial conversion feature expense is immediately recognized in the quarter in which the debenture is converted 
similarly  when we issue warrants in connection with convertible securities  we record debt discount for financial expenses that is amortized ratably over the term of the convertible securities  when the convertible securities are converted  the entire remaining unamortized debt discount is immediately recognized in the quarter in which the convertible securities are converted 
during and  we issued restricted shares to certain of our employees 
these shares were issued as stock bonuses  and are restricted for a period of up to three years from the date of issuance 
relevant accounting rules provide that the aggregate amount of the difference between the purchase price of the restricted shares in this case  generally zero and the market price of the shares on the date of grant is taken as a general and administrative expense  amortized over the life of the period of the restriction 
as a result of the application of the above accounting rules  we incurred non cash charges related to stock based compensation in and in the amount of  and  respectively 
as a result of options granted to employees and the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payments  we incurred non cash charges related to stock based compensation in and in the amount of  and  respectively 
as part of the repricings and exercises of warrants described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock 
since the terms of these warrants provided that the warrants were exercisable subject to our obtaining stockholder approval  in accordance with emerging issues task force no  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  the fair value of the warrants was recorded as a liability at the closing date 
such fair value was remeasured at each subsequent cut off date until we obtained stockholder approval 
the fair value of these warrants was remeasured as at june  the date of the stockholder approval using the black scholes pricing model assuming a risk free interest rate of  a volatility factor of  dividend yields of and a contractual life of approximately years 
the change in the fair value of the warrants between the date of the grant and june  in the amount of  has been recorded as finance income 
under the terms of our convertible notes  which have been paid in full  we had the option in respect of scheduled principal repayments to force conversion of the payment amount at a conversion price based upon the weighted average trading price of our common stock during the trading days prior to the conversion  less a discount of 
on april   we and each holder of our convertible notes agreed that we would force immediate conversion of an aggregate of  principal amount of the convertible notes into  shares of our common stock 
the amount converted eliminated our obligation to make the installment payments under the convertible notes on each of march   january   november  and september  aggregating a total of 
in addition  as a result of the conversion an additional  was applied against part of the installment payment due july  after giving effect to the conversion   of principal remained outstanding under the convertible notes 
during the remainder of  we converted  of principal remaining outstanding under our convertible notes by forcing conversion of this principal amount into  shares of or common stock 
during  we converted the remaining  of principal remaining outstanding under our convertible notes by forcing conversion of this principal amount into  shares of our common stock 
additionally  in an effort to improve our cash situation and our shareholders equity  we have periodically induced holders of certain of our warrants to exercise their warrants by lowering the exercise price of the warrants in exchange for immediate exercise of such warrants  and by issuing to such investors new warrants 
under such circumstances  we record a deemed dividend in an amount determined based upon the fair value of the new warrants using the black scholes pricing model 
as and to the extent that we engage in similar warrant repricings and issuances in the future  we would incur similar non cash charges 
during and  the company recorded expenses of  and million  respectively  attributable to amortization related to warrants issued to the holders of convertible debentures and the beneficial conversion feature 
during and  the company also recorded expenses of  and million  respectively  attributable to financial expenses in connection with convertible debenture principle repayment 
additionally  during and  the company recorded expenses of  and  respectively  attributable to amortization of deferred charges related to convertible debentures issuance that were recorded as a general and administrative expense

during  we through our subsidiaries recognized revenues as follows ies and faac recognized revenues from the sale of interactive use of force training systems and from the provision of maintenance services in connection with such systems 
mdt  mdt armor and aoa recognized revenues from payments under vehicle armoring contracts  for service and repair of armored vehicles  and on sale of armoring products 
efb and epsilor recognized revenues from the sale of batteries  chargers and adapters to the military  and under certain development contracts with the us army 
efl recognized revenues from the sale of water activated battery wab lifejacket lights 
revenues for totaled million  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to the following factors increased revenues from our training and simulation division million more in versus 
increased revenues from our battery and power systems division million more in versus 
increased revenues from our armor division million more in versus 
in  revenues were million for the training and simulation division compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to increased sales of military vehicle simulators and use of force simulators  million for the battery and power systems division compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to increased sales of our battery products at epsilor and efb  and million for the armor division compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to increased revenues from mdt and mdt armor  mostly in respect of orders for the david armored vehicle 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues totaled million during  compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to increased sales in all divisions  particularly in the production of the david armored vehicle in our armor division  which accounted for over million of the increase 
total cost of revenues and cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue also increased in the battery and power systems division due to several factors  primarily the production of new products 
cost of revenues for our three divisions during were million for the training and simulation division compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to increased revenues  million for the battery and power systems division compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to increased revenues  and million for the armor division compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to production of the david armored vehicle 
amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets totaled million in  compared to million in  a decrease of  or  due primarily to completion of the amortization of certain intangible assets at our faac and aoa subsidiaries 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses for were million  compared to million during  an increase of  or  due primarily to an increase in expenses at faac for expenses associated with the improvements to our simulator products 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses for were million  compared to million  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to the overall increase in revenues and their associated sales and marketing expenses in our training and simulation division and armor division  partially offset by a reduction in expense in our battery and power systems division 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for were million  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to additional expenses in all three operating divisions  partially offset by a reduction in corporate expenses 
financial expenses  net 
financial expenses totaled approximately  in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the difference was due primarily to decreased interest related to our convertible notes that were issued in september  as a result of payments of principal during  and financial expenses in related to repayment by forced conversion of our convertible notes at an discount to average market price as provided under the terms of the convertible notes that did not occur to the same extent in income taxes 
we and certain of our subsidiaries incurred net operating losses during and  accordingly  no provision for income taxes was for these losses recorded 
with respect to some of our subsidiaries that operated at a net profit during  we were able to offset federal taxes against our accumulated loss carry forward 
we recorded a total of  in tax expenses in  compared to  in tax expenses in  mainly due to state taxes 
we also set up a tax liability for the impact of the deductions taken for good will amounted to  in we also adjusted the accumulated deficit in the amount of  to correct the balances in prior years 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
current accounting standards require us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually  and between annual tests in certain circumstances  when we determine goodwill is impaired  it must be written down  rather than being amortized as previous accounting standards required 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of our reportable units with their carrying value 
fair value is determined using discounted cash flows 
significant estimates used in the methodologies include estimates of future cash flows  future short term and long term growth rates  weighted average cost of capital and estimates of market multiples for the reportable units 
we performed the required annual impairment test of goodwill  based on our management s projections and using expected future discounted operating cash flows 
we did not identify any impairment of goodwill during in the corresponding period of  we identified in aoa an impairment of goodwill in the amount of  net loss 
due to the factors cited above  net loss from operations decreased from million in to million in  an improvement of million  or 
net loss attributable to common stockholders was million in  due to a deemed dividend that was recorded in the amount of  in due to the repricing of existing warrants and the issuance of new warrants 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million in cash   in restricted collateral securities  million in an escrow receivable and  in available for sale marketable securities  as compared to at december   when we had million in cash   in restricted collateral securities  million in an escrow receivable and  in available for sale marketable securities 
we also had million available in unused bank lines of credit  including funds drawn under a million line of credit in favor of our faac subsidiary  which line of credit is secured by our assets and the assets of our other subsidiaries and guaranteed by us and our other subsidiaries 
we used available funds in primarily for sales and marketing  continued research and development expenditures  and other working capital needs 
we increased our investment in fixed assets including the purchase of two buildings in alabama by million during the year ended december  our net fixed assets amounted to million as at year end 
net cash provided by used in operating activities for and was million and million  respectively  an increase of million  due primarily to the reduction of our net loss in  offset in part by an increase in our accounts receivable 
net cash used in investing activities for and was million and  respectively 
this increase was primarily the result of the purchase of fixed assets along with the payment of promissory notes in respect of an arbitration settlement related to the acquisition of faac 
net cash provided by financing activities for and was million and  respectively  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in long term debt 
as of december   we had based on the contractual amount of the debt and not on the accounting valuation of the debt  not taking into consideration trade payables  other accounts payables and accrued severance pay approximately million in bank debt outstanding 
subject to all of the reservations regarding forward looking statements set forth above  we believe that our present cash position  anticipated cash flows from operations and lines of credit should be sufficient to satisfy our current estimated cash requirements through the remainder of the year 
in this connection  we note that from time to time our working capital needs are partially dependent on our subsidiaries lines of credit 
in the event that we are unable to continue to make use of our subsidiaries lines of credit for working capital on economically feasible terms  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
over the long term  we will need to become profitable  at least on a cash flow basis  and maintain that profitability in order to avoid future capital requirements 
additionally  we would need to raise additional capital in order to fund any future acquisitions 
effective corporate tax rate we and certain of our subsidiaries incurred net operating losses during the years ended december  and  and accordingly no provision for income taxes was required 
with respect to some of our us subsidiaries that operated at a net profit during  we were able to offset federal taxes against our net operating loss carryforward  which amounted to approximately million as of december  these subsidiaries are  however  subject to state taxes that cannot be offset against our net operating loss carryforward 
with respect to certain of our israeli subsidiaries that operated at a net profit during  we were unable to offset their taxes against our net operating loss carryforward  and we are therefore exposed to israeli taxes  at a rate of up to in less  in the case of companies that have approved enterprise status as discussed in note b to the notes to financial statements 
we also set up a tax liability for the impact of the deductions taken for goodwill 
as of december   we had a us net operating loss carryforward of approximately million that is available to offset future taxable income under certain circumstances  expiring primarily from through  and foreign net operating and capital loss carryforwards of approximately million  which are available indefinitely to offset future taxable income under certain circumstances 
contractual obligations the following table lists our contractual obligations and commitments as of december   not including trade payables and other accounts payable payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt short term debt promissory note due to purchase of subsidiaries operating lease obligations capital lease obligations severance obligations primarily in short term bank debt 
includes operating lease obligations related to rent 
includes obligations related to special severance pay arrangements in addition to the severance amounts due to certain employees pursuant to israeli severance pay law the amount shown in the table above with payment due during the next years might not be paid in the period stated in the event the employment agreements to which such severance obligations relate are extended
