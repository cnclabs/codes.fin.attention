executive overview net income for of million was nearly equivalent to the net income of million reported in net income per diluted share was  a increase over the reported for  which reflects the favorable impact of the common stock repurchases completed in and early the following were significant factors related to the results of fiscal year compared to fiscal year net interest income decreased  or million  which was primarily a function of the flat yield curve  which drove up deposit and borrowing costs more significantly than income on earning assets  and the addition of a full year of interest cost on the trust preferred securities issued during as a result  the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis was in compared to in the provision for loan and lease losses of  decreased million in from as a result of a million decline in loan balances  a decrease in non performing loans as a percentage of total loans  and a slight decrease in net charge offs in compared to non interest income increased  or million  primarily due to an increase in income from fiduciary services at acadia trust  na  brokerage and insurance commission income at acadia financial consultants and growth in debit card activity 
non interest expenses decreased  or  primarily due to a decline in professional fees  a charge of  related to the steamship navigation et al litigation involving cnb  and  in expenses incurred in as part of the merger of our two banks  all partially offset by normal salary and benefit cost increases and investments in technology in total assets at december  decreased million  or  as loans were down million  or  from  while investments were up million  or  for the same periods 
total liabilities at december  of billion decreased million  or  as deposit balances were down million  or  and the due to broker was down million as it settled in january  both partially offset by an increase in borrowings of million  or  from the same date a year earlier 
shareholders equity increased due to current year earnings and a positive change in other comprehensive income  partially offset by share buybacks and dividends declared 
results of operations comparison of to we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for compared to million and per diluted share in return on average assets was in  compared to in and return on average shareholders equity was in  compared to in net interest income net interest income accounted for of total revenues  and is our largest source of revenue 
net interest income reflects revenues generated through income from earning assets plus loan fees  less interest paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
net interest income was million on a fully taxable equivalent basis in  compared page

our level of net interest income fluctuates over time for three primary reasons interest earned from earning assets and expenses from interest bearing deposits and borrowings fluctuate due to changes in interest rates 
this is referred to as the yield or rate component of net interest income 
net interest income changes due to the amount of earning assets we maintain  as well as the amount of non interest bearing deposits  interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
this is referred to as the volume component of net interest income 
net interest income fluctuates as a result of the change  over time  in the components of earning assets  non interest bearing deposits  interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
this is referred to as the mix component of net interest income 
it is our goal to maximize net interest income by providing competitive products to customers that  within various risk parameters  maximize interest income while minimizing interest expense 
we use several analytical models  including those illustrated by tables on pages and below  to assess and monitor those factors that affect net interest income  to assess our performance in meeting our goals and to determine future strategies 
impact of rates 
overall  during compared to  our net interest income was adversely impacted million due to rate changes  with increased earning asset yields contributing million  while increased funding costs decreased net interest income million 
during the first three quarters of  benchmark interest rates were at levels above those in and remained relatively stable until declines in the fourth quarter of a one half percentage point  followed by two quarter percentage point decreases  in the federal funds discount rate fed funds rate  which culminated at at december  the slope of the curve was relatively flat  thus the spread between short term and long term rates was historically low 
interest income on securities was positively impacted  during as a result of new investments being added to the portfolio at higher yields than maturing investments 
our loan yields were also positively impacted  due to increases in market rates  in addition to the mid year credit and subprime crisis  which has resulted in the gradual return of pricing credit risk into loan rates 
for our interest bearing liabilities  the higher rate environment and flat yield curve during had a negative impact as maturing deposit products and term borrowings re priced upward upon maturity 
as a result of the rate environment and the highly competitive environment in which we compete  we raised the rates paid on certain deposit products  primarily certificates of deposit and money market accounts  as competitors also raised rates paid on such products 
due to the increase in rates paid on deposit products  our interest expense increased million in compared in addition  in  we were negatively impacted  due to increases in short term borrowing rates  which were primarily overnight funds from the federal home loan bank of boston fhlbb and  due to increased rates paid on our brokered certificate of deposits 
impact of volume 
overall  during compared to  our net interest income was negatively impacted million due to volume changes  with average earning asset growth and mix reducing the margin  and the need for increased funding to support the average asset growth decreased net interest income million 
during  average investment volume increases contributed million to net interest income  while average loan balance declines reduced the margin million 
in order to fund the modest average balance sheet growth experienced during  average retail deposits increased million  or  and borrowings increased million  or  partially offset by a million  or  decline in average brokered deposits 
during  the all in cost of brokered certificates of deposit was greater than the borrowing cost for wholesale repurchase agreements or fhlbb advances with similar maturities  thus resulting in the decline in brokered certificate of deposit balances 
information on average balances  yields and rates for the past three years can be found in table on page table on page shows the changes from to in tax equivalent net interest income by category due to changes in rate and volume 
information on interest rate sensitivity can be found in the market risk section below

risk factors and the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements 
non interest income non interest income increased to million for the year ended december   from million in  which was growth of million  or 
due to increases in assets under administration at at  income from fiduciary services increased  or  in compared to brokerage and insurance commission income increased  or  primarily due to increased sales efforts and assets under management 
other service charges and fees increased  or  as both debit card income and atm non customer fee income increased due to growth in transaction volumes 
earnings on bank owned life insurance increased  or  primarily due to increases in rates paid on cash values 
non interest expenses non interest expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million in  a change of  or 
the decrease  primarily in other expenses  was due to a  charge in related to the steamship navigation et al litigation involving cnb   in expenses incurred in as part of the merger of our two banks  a  decline in director fees in as a portion of director fees are indexed to the stock price and the stock price has decreased since december   and a  decline in legal costs due to the completion of the litigation pending in and related legal cost insurance reimbursements received in these decreases were somewhat offset by increased employee compensation costs of  or  due to normal salary and benefit cost increases  furniture  equipment and data processing costs of  or  as a result of increased amortization and depreciation costs associated with technology purchases software and hardware necessary to support our growth and information security initiatives  and net occupancy costs of  or  primarily due to increased utility costs  repairs and maintenance costs on various facilities  and depreciation costs on the renovated spear block rockland branch which was placed into service during the first quarter of comparison of to we reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for compared to million and per diluted share in return on average assets was in  compared to in and return on average shareholders equity was in  compared to in the decrease in return on average assets was primarily a result of an environment of increasing interest rates and a flattening yield curve 
this environment resulted in longer duration earning assets loans and investments booked during to experience less of an increase in yields compared to the increase in funding costs  thus we did not produce the same level of net interest spread yield on earning assets less cost on associated funding liabilities compared to the prior year 
the return on average assets was also negatively affected by the introduction of the recurring interest cost of the trust preferred security issuance 
the increase in the return on average equity was primarily due to the repurchase of  shares of common stock during  most of which were purchased as part of the second quarter dutch auction tender offer

impact of volume 
during  loan volume increases contributed million to net interest income as residential mortgages increased million  or  commercial loan balances increased million  or  and consumer loans including home equities increased million  or 
the significant increase in new residential loans was the result of longer term mortgage rates remaining low due to the relatively flat yield curve 
in order to fund balance sheet growth experienced during  deposits excluding brokered certificates of deposits increased  or million  the majority of which was experienced in higher costing money market and certificates of deposit 
in addition  we use brokered certificates of deposit  which increased million  or  when we determine that the all in cost of the brokered certificates of deposit is comparable to the borrowing cost for fhlbb advances with similar maturities  or to simply diversify our funding mix

furniture  equipment and data processing costs increased  as a result of increased amortization and depreciation costs associated with technology purchases software and hardware necessary to support our growth and information security initiatives 
net occupancy costs increased  primarily due to increased utility costs and repairs and maintenance costs on various facilities 
these increases were somewhat offset by decreased employee compensation costs as we did not pay a general incentive bonus for  and reduced our benefit costs due to a change in health care providers
