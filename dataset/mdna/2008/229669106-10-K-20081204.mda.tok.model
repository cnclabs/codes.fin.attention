item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our two primary businesses are in the defense and transportation industries 
for the year ended september   of sales were derived from defense  while were derived from transportation fare collection systems and other commercial operations 
these are high technology businesses that design  manufacture and integrate complex systems to meet the needs of various federal and regional government agencies in the us and other nations around the world 
the us government remains our largest customer  accounting for approximately of sales in and compared to in our defense segment is focused on three primary lines of business training systems formerly known as readiness systems  mission support services  and communications 
the segment is a diversified supplier of constructive  live and virtual military training systems  services and communication systems and products to the us department of defense  other government agencies and allied nations 
we design instrumented range systems for fighter aircraft  armored vehicles and infantry force on force live training  weapons effects simulations  laser based tactical and communication systems  and precision gunnery solutions 
our services are focused on training mission support  computer simulation training  distributed interactive simulation  development of military training doctrine  force modernization services for nato entrants and field operations and maintenance 
our communications products are aimed at intelligence  surveillance  and search and rescue markets 
cubic transportation systems develops and delivers innovative fare collection systems for public transit authorities worldwide 
we provide hardware  software and multiagency  multimodal transportation integration technologies and services that allow the agencies to efficiently collect fares  manage their operations  reduce shrinkage and make using public transit a more convenient and attractive option for commuters 
consolidated overview sales in fiscal were down slightly from because of the sale of our corrugated box business in the fourth quarter of sales in were million compared to million in  a decrease 
sales in had increased over sales of million 
in transportation systems sales increased over  while defense sales decreased 
in contrast  sales from defense were up and transportations systems sales were down 
see the segment discussions following for further analysis of segment sales 
operating income decreased in fiscal to million from million in operating income in had doubled from million in operating income in the transportation systems segment increased significantly in  more than doubling from the level 
however  operating income from defense was down  more than offsetting the improvement from transportation systems 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of we recorded a restructuring charge of million as the result of a reduction in force in our defense systems subsidiary and corporate headquarters in san diego  california 
this cost cutting measure is intended to streamline operations and enhance competitiveness in the defense related marketplace 
the improvement in had come from both segments with transportation systems increasing significantly from a low level in and defense improving by more than 
see the segment discussions following for further details of segment operating results 
net income decreased in fiscal to million per share from million per share in net income had increased in fiscal from million 
per share in lower net income in resulted primarily from the decrease in defense operating income and the restructuring costs mentioned above  which impacted net income by approximately million after applicable income taxes  or per share 
also included in was a gain of million in the fourth quarter on the sale of our investment in a defense related joint venture that added approximately million to net income  after applicable income taxes  or 
per share 
in we sold our corrugated box business  also in the fourth quarter  for a gain of approximately million  after applicable income taxes  or 
per share 
approximately million  after applicable income taxes  of the net income was from a gain on the sale of real estate that added per share 
reductions in tax contingency reserves accounted for approximately million  million and million  respectively  of the  and net income 
the gross margin from product sales improved in to from in and in improved performance from our transportation systems segment in both and and improvement in defense training systems in contributed to the higher margin from product sales 
the gross margin from service sales was in  compared to in and in higher sales and margins from transportation systems service contracts in europe contributed to the improvement in  while the completion of a high margin transportation service contract in europe resulted in the decrease in compared to selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million  or of sales  in  compared to million  or of sales  in and million  or of sales  in in  sg a increased in the defense segment due to increased bid and proposal efforts and the acquisition of a new subsidiary 
company sponsored research and development r d spending increased to million in from million in and million in the increase came primarily from projects to develop new data link technologies and transportation security related development initiatives 
our r d spending continues to be incurred primarily in connection with customer funded activities 
we do not rely heavily on company sponsored r d  as most of our new product development occurs in conjunction with the performance of work on our contracts 
the amount of contract required development activity in was million  compared to million in and million in  however  these costs are included in cost of sales  rather than r d  as they are directly related to contract performance 
interest and dividend income increased to million in from million in and million in due primarily to higher available cash balances for investment 
other income expense netted to an expense of million in compared to income of million in and million in primarily due to foreign currency exchange losses on advances to our foreign subsidiaries 
interest expense decreased to million in compared to million in and million in because of a reduction in both short and long term borrowings 
our effective tax rate for was of pretax income compared to in and in our effective rate in decreased primarily because more of our income came from foreign tax jurisdictions where we do not incur state tax expenses and tax rates are generally lower 
partially offsetting this benefit was a million provision for us taxes on million in dividends from our uk and new zealand subsidiaries that were paid in compared to a similar provision of million in and million in tax credits were lower in than in and  primarily because the research and experimentation r e credit had expired as of december  subsequent to the end of the year  in october  the us congress reinstated the r e credit retroactive to january   however  the benefit of this credit for the nine months ended september   estimated to be about million  will not be recorded until the first quarter of fiscal the effective rate in  and also benefited from the reversal of tax contingency provisions amounting to million  million and million  respectively 
our effective tax rate could be affected in future years by  among other factors  the mix of business between us and foreign jurisdictions  our ability to take advantage of available tax credits  and audits of our records by taxing authorities 
restructuring activity as mentioned earlier  in the fourth quarter of we reduced our defense segment workforce in san diego by employees 
in addition  corporate office positions were eliminated 
this action was the result of a cost cutting initiative designed to streamline operations  enhance our competitiveness and better position us in the defense related marketplace 
affected employees received severance pay and outplacement assistance  as well as company paid medical coverage for a defined period based on years of service 
the cost of this restructuring was million million after applicable income taxes and is reflected in our results for the fourth quarter 
we estimate this cost cutting action will yield an annual savings of approximately million  before applicable income taxes 
business acquisition in july  we acquired all outstanding capital stock of the privately held omega training group  inc omega 
the purchase was for million in cash which was funded from existing cash reserves 
omega provides training  testing  analysis  logistics and staffing services to us army locations at the us army infantry school at fort benning  fort bliss  fort jackson and fort hood 
founded in  omega now has employees 
we believe this acquisition will enhance our position in the defense services market place and add revenues of approximately million in defense segment years ended september  in millions defense segment sales mission support services training systems communications tactical systems and other defense segment operating income mission support services training systems communications tactical systems and other as depicted in the table above  sales from our defense segment decreased to million in  compared to million in  after having increased in from million in lower sales from training systems and communications resulted in the decrease in  while mission support services sales increased 
sales from mission support services and training systems were both higher in than in  however  communications sales decreased in from the level 
the caption tactical systems and other in the table above includes advanced programs for the development of new defense technologies and the operating results of the joint venture company in which we previously owned a interest 
we sold our interest in the jv to our former partner in august  as we no longer believe the venture has the growth potential we had anticipated at its inception 
operating income in our defense segment decreased to million in from million in  a decrease 
in  operating income had increased from operating income of million 
operating income was sharply lower in from training systems  while the operating loss from communications increased significantly from the small operating loss posted in mission support services operating income increased slightly in over the level 
growth in operating income had come from both training systems and mission support services  while communications had generated an operating loss in compared to operating income in the joint venture company made a small operating profit of million in  prior to its sale  after having incurred operating losses of million and million in and  respectively 
mission support services mission support services sales increased in  after having increased in compared to about half of the sales increase in came from omega  the company we acquired at the end of july we believe the addition of omega enhances our capability and strategic position in the defense services marketplace and are pleased with the results from the business thus far 
we also realized higher sales from our contract with the us marine corps that was expanded as a result of the contract renewal in and from a new contract at the us army quartermaster school 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in activity during at the joint readiness training center jrtc in fort polk  la 
the increase in sales had come from the expansion of existing programs and from new contracts won in sales were higher in compared to by nearly million from the jrtc contract  due to an increase in training exercises conducted by the customer 
in addition  increased activity from the us marine corps contract and higher sales from contracts for modeling the effects of weapons of mass destruction had added to the sales 
operating income from mission support services increased only in  after increasing in the new company  omega  contributed over million to operating profits in the first two months we owned it 
in addition  higher sales from the us marine corps contract also contributed to operating income growth in however  these increases were nearly offset by lower sales and profit margins from the jrtc contract and from other mission support services contracts that had experienced particularly strong performance in higher sales volume and award fees helped to increase profitability in compared to and improved operating income as a percentage of sales to  compared to 
the most significant increases in operating income had come from the us marine corp 
and jrtc contracts mentioned above 
training systems training systems sales decreased in  returning to the level of  after having increased in the decrease in sales came from each of the major product lines  including air combat training  ground combat training  electro optics laser based tactical engagement systems and small arms virtual training systems 
sales were lower by million from the air combat training system contract known as p and from an air combat training system in australia that was completed in the first quarter 
partially offsetting these sales decreases was an increase in sales from the new joint strike fighter jsf development contract and other air combat training contracts 
sales were also lower from a ground combat training system contract in the far east and from small arms training systems 
sales in three of the training systems product lines have been impacted by a transition from the development phase  where revenue is recognized on a cost to cost percentage completion basis  to the production phase  where we recognize revenues from production orders on a units of delivery percentage completion basis  resulting in the recording of sales when the product is delivered and accepted by the customer 
this includes the p air combat training contract  electro optics and small arms training systems 
this transition also resulted in an increase in inventories of million  offset by customer advances of million from these product lines in fiscal most of the increase in sales compared to had come from air combat training systems  while ground combat training and small arms virtual training systems sales grew slightly 
training systems operating income decreased in compared to after having nearly doubled in from lower sales from the p and australian air combat training contracts and small arms virtual training systems contributed to the decrease in operating income 
however  the primary cause of the decrease was cost growth of million on the electro optics contract to develop the next generation laser based tactical engagement system 
this cost growth stemmed from problems encountered in the second quarter during system integration testing and resulted in greater difficulties than we had previously anticipated 
in addition to increased engineering development costs for design changes  these changes also resulted in higher manufacturing costs and rework costs 
we also experienced further cost growth of million in on a contract for the development of a ground combat training system in the middle east 
this compares to cost growth of million in on the same contract 
improved profit margins from a ground combat training system in canada partially offset the impact from this contract 
the increase in operating income compared to had come from higher profit margins on higher sales of air combat training systems and improvements in profitability of ground combat training systems and small arms training systems 
higher profit margins from a ground combat training system in the far east in were offset by cost growth on the ground combat training system in the middle east mentioned above  while operating income from other ground combat training systems improved slightly 
operating income from small arms training systems had improved in due to somewhat higher sales and completion of the development of new weapons simulations systems in  resulting in decreased costs in communications sales from communications decreased in  after having decreased in from the level 
sales decreased in from contracts for the development of data links for unmanned aerial vehicles in the us and u 
k 
and from a contract for the development of a data link for the us navy 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales of personnel locator systems and power amplifiers 
in sales increased from the contract for the supply of data links for unmanned aerial vehicles in the uk  however  this increase was more than offset by decreases in sales from other data link contracts that neared completion in sales of personnel locator systems and power amplifiers also decreased in communications incurred an operating loss of million in compared to an operating loss of million in and operating income of million in the primary cause of the loss in was cost growth of million from a contract to develop new data link technology for unmanned aerial vehicles for a uk customer 
we have encountered significant difficulties in performing this firm fixed price contract due in part to customer caused delay and disruption  directed changes and due to delays caused by two subcontractors 
we have completed discussions with the customer to substantially restructure the contract and believe we have now established a reasonable basis for completion of the contract and resolution of the issues with the most problematic subcontractor 
the contract modification  when signed  will add additional contract value for a portion of the out of scope costs we have incurred and anticipate incurring and remove our responsibility for the subcontractor s performance 
we continue to have performance risks going forward but we anticipate that the contract value added by the modification will be sufficient to cover those risks 
cost growth on two other data link development contracts impacted profitability by million in one of these is a contract with the us navy for which we had inventoried costs of million in that were the subject of a legal proceeding before the us armed services board of contract appeals 
we reached a settlement agreement with this customer whereby we will be paid for million of the million in costs and have expensed the remainder 
as a part of the settlement we provided other concessions to the customer  which also were expensed  in exchange for them dropping all claims against us 
in addition  we started work on several research and development projects for new data link technology during  which added million to the operating loss for the year 
partially offsetting these increased costs was higher operating income on higher sales of power amplifiers and personnel locator systems 
communications had generated an operating loss of million in due primarily to cost growth of million on a contract for the development of new data link technology 
profit margins on other data link contracts were also lower than in  however  this decrease was partially offset by improved profit margins from sales of power amplifiers and personnel locator systems in operating income in had come primarily from the sale of power amplifiers and data links  in addition to the favorable settlement of a long standing dispute with a customer during the year  which added million to operating income 
transportation systems segment years ended september  in millions transportation segment sales transportation segment operating income transportation systems sales increased in after having decreased in sales increased in primarily due to additional work from change orders on the prestige contract and from other contracts in the uk sales were also higher from system installation work on a contract in australia and increased sales of spare parts in north america 
these increases were partially offset by decreased sales from system installation contracts in north america and sweden 
the exchange rate between the british pound and the us dollar had no impact on sales for  when compared to  as the average rate for the year was virtually the same as in as a result of a decrease in the value of the british pound compared to the us dollar in late fiscal and subsequently  we expect that the dollar value of transportation systems sales and operating income from our uk subsidiary will be lower in fiscal than in sales in north america and sweden had decreased in compared to  while sales in australia and the uk had increased 
sales in australia increased due in part to a settlement reached with the customer during that increased the value of the contract 
in the uk sales had been lower in from a service contract that was phased out because old ticket issuing equipment was replaced by modern equipment requiring less maintenance  however  this decrease was more than offset by higher sales from other uk contracts  including the prestige contract 
a major contributor to the increase in uk sales in had been the strength of the british pound against the us dollar  which resulted in the dollar value of sales in the uk increasing million for the year when compared to average exchange rates experienced in operating income in the transportation systems segment more than doubled in when compared to  after having improved significantly in from the low level of higher sales and improved performance from uk contracts  including bonuses earned on the prestige contract for system usage  and profits from increased spares sales in the us contributed to the increase in cost growth on north american contracts that had been a profit drain in recent years was limited to million in  a significant improvement over when cost growth on the same contracts had been million 
partially offsetting the profit improvements in was cost growth of million on a contract in sweden and an investment in new technology of million we made related to a new contract in north america 
these development costs are required for this contract  however  they will benefit future programs as well 
a reduction in legal fees of million in also contributed to the operating income improvement 
as mentioned above relating to sales  currency exchange between the british pound and us dollar had no impact on operating income when compared to in  settlements reached with three customers added million to operating income  however  we also added million to our estimate of costs to complete two of these contracts that year  yielding a net improvement to operating income of million from these contract settlements 
operating income from the prestige contract had increased when compared to  including bonuses earned for system usage and the effect of a higher currency exchange rate 
currency exchange differences had resulted in an improvement in operating income of about million from all uk contracts  when comparing the average exchange rate to the rate 
as mentioned above  cost growth on north american system installation contracts in was million compared to million in  helping to improve operating income 
lower operating income from the uk service contract mentioned above and from spare parts sales in the us partially offset these improvements 
in addition  cost growth from a contract in sweden totaling million in had also impacted operating income 
higher legal fees in further reduced operating income for the year by million when compared to backlog september  in millions total backlog transportation systems defense mission support services training systems communications other total defense total funded backlog transportation systems defense mission support services training systems communications other total defense total in addition to the amounts identified above  the company has been selected as a participant in or  in some cases  the sole contractor for several substantial indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts 
idiq contracts are not included in backlog until an order is received 
in august  transport for london tfl notified our owned subsidiary  transys  that they will be terminating the prestige fare collection system contract as of august in accordance with the early termination provision of the contract 
as a result of this early termination  the last five years of our contracts with transys and the other shareholder were also terminated and  therefore  this portion of the contract value was removed from backlog in the table above as of september  our transportation systems backlog at september  included million million relating to the terminated portion of our contracts with transys and the other shareholder covering the period from august through august in november  tfl awarded cubic directly a new three year contract that includes virtually all of the services currently being performed by transys through its shareholders 
the term of this contract is for the time period from august to august  with a base value of approximately million million  which will be added to our backlog in the quarter ending december  the contract value will be indexed for inflation from august through its completion and additionally includes variable payments that are contingent upon system usage  similar to provisions that were contained in the prestige contract 
aside from the impact of the prestige contract early termination described above  a decrease in the value of the british pound vs 
the us dollar between september  and september   resulted in a decrease in transportation systems backlog of approximately million 
the difference between total backlog and funded backlog represents options under multiyear service contracts 
funding for these contracts comes from annual operating budgets of the us government and the options are normally exercised annually 
options for the purchase of additional systems or equipment are not included in backlog until exercised 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which we adopted on october  the purpose of fin is to clarify and set forth consistent rules for accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this interpretation are required to be reported separately as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
the effect of adopting fin on our financial condition at september  has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
see note for further discussion of the effect of adopting fin in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which we will adopt in the quarter ending december  sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we currently do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which we will adopt in the quarter ending december  this statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings 
we currently do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in december the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which we will adopt in the fiscal year beginning october  this statement applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses 
this statement applies to all business entities  including mutual entities that previously used the pooling of interests method of accounting for some business combinations 
we currently do not expect that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in march the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which we will adopt in the quarter ending march  this statement requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
the statement requires that objectives for using derivative instruments be disclosed in terms of underlying risks and accounting designation 
we currently do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations totaled million in  compared to million in and million in in addition to cash generated by earnings  a decrease in accounts receivable in each of the three years amounting to million  million and million in  and  respectively  contributed to the positive cash flows 
in addition  net customer advances of million  million and million in  and  respectively  added to the positive result 
inventories grew in and  using cash of million and million  respectively  reflecting the transition from development type contracts to production contracts described in the defense segment section above 
positive operating cash flows in came from both segments  with the greater portion coming from transportation systems 
all of the operating cash flows in had come from the transportation systems segment  while defense cash flows were slightly negative for the year 
both the defense and transportation systems segments had generated positive cash flows in  with the larger amount contributed by transportation systems in that year as well 
we have classified certain unbilled accounts receivable balances as noncurrent because we do not expect to receive payment within one year from the balance sheet date 
at september   this balance was million compared to million at september  cash flows used in investing activities in included our acquisition of omega training group  inc  which used cash of million  net of cash acquired 
the remaining balance of the purchase price amounting to million was paid subsequent to september  and was included in other current liabilities at that date 
we made capital expenditures of million in  partially offset by proceeds of million from the sale of our interest in the joint venture mentioned previously 
we liquidated million of short term investments in the first quarter of fiscal  thereby avoiding much of the turmoil in the credit markets that occurred later in the year 
during we had invested a net of million in these financial instruments  received million from the sale of our former corrugated box business and made million in capital expenditures 
investing activities in had included capital expenditures of million  proceeds from the sale of investment real estate of million and the addition of million to short term investments 
financing activities in included scheduled payments on long term borrowings of million and the payment of a dividend to shareholders of million cents per share 
financing activities in had included the repayment of short term borrowings of million and scheduled payments on long term borrowings of million  in addition to the payment of a dividend to shareholders of million cents per share 
financing activities in had included scheduled debt payments of million  repayment of short term borrowings of million and dividends to shareholders of million 
accumulated other comprehensive income decreased million in because of foreign currency translation adjustments of million and an increase in the recorded liability for our pension plans of million  after applicable income taxes 
these adjustments decreased the positive balance in accumulated other comprehensive income from million as of september  to million at september  the pension plan unfunded balance increased from the september  balance of million to million at september  this decrease in the funding position can be attributed to a return on plan assets for the year that was much lower than our assumed rate of return but was partially offset by the effect of an increase in the discount rate we used to calculate the pension liability 
the net deferred tax asset increased to million at september  compared to million at september  the primary reason for the increase is that the effect of recording adjustments to the pension liability through other comprehensive income resulted in a deferred tax asset of million at september  compared to a deferred tax liability of million at september  we expect to generate sufficient taxable income in the future such that the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
our financial condition remains strong with working capital of million and a current ratio of to at september  we expect that cash on hand and our ability to access the debt markets will be adequate to meet our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition to the short term borrowing arrangements we have in the uk and new zealand  we have a committed five year credit facility from a group of financial institutions in the us  aggregating million 
as of september   million of this capacity was used for letters of credit  leaving an additional million available 
our total debt to capital ratio at september  was less than 
in addition  our cash balance totaled million at september  which exceeded our total long term debt by million 
our cash is invested primarily in highly liquid government treasury instruments in the u 
s 
and europe 
the following is a schedule of our contractual obligations outstanding as of september  total less than year years years after years in millions long term debt interest payments operating leases deferred compensation critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  the most critical of which are those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  valuation of goodwill and p ension costs 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
besides the estimates identified above that are considered critical  we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures 
all estimates  whether or not deemed critical  affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and judgments are also based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as c ircumstances change and additional information becomes known  even for estimates and judgments that are not deemed critical 
this discussion of critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments should be read in conjunction with other disclosures included in this discussion  and the notes to the consolidated financial statements related to estimates  contingencies and new accounting standards 
significant accounting policies are identified in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed each of the critical accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition a significant portion of our business is derived from long term development  production and system integration contracts which we account for consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  and the aicpa s statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we consider the nature of these contracts  and the types of products and services provided  when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
generally  we record revenue for long term fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion 
most of our long term fixed price contracts require us to deliver minimal quantities over a long period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in relation to the total value of the contract 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize revenue based on a ratio of the costs incurred to the estimated total costs at completion 
for certain other long term  fixed price production contracts not requiring substantial development effort we use the units of delivery percentage completion method as the basis to measure progress toward completing the contract and recognizing sales 
the units of delivery measure is a modification of the percentage of completion method  which recognizes revenues as deliveries are made to the customer generally using unit sales values in accordance with the contract terms 
we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the life of the contract based on deliveries 
amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items are included in the contract value only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
provisions are made on a current basis to fully recognize any anticipated losses on contracts 
we record sales under cost reimbursement type contracts as we incur the costs 
incentives or penalties and awards applicable to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profits  and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance 
incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs 
sales of products are recorded when a firm sales agreement is in place  delivery has occurred and collectibility of the fixed or determinable sales price is reasonably assured 
sales for fixed price service contracts that do not contain measurable units of work performed are generally recognized on straight line basis over the contractual service period  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned  or obligations fulfilled  in a different manner 
sales for fixed price service contracts that contain measurable units of work performed are recognized when the units of work are completed 
sales and profits on contracts that specify multiple deliverables are allocated to separate units of accounting when there is objective evidence that each accounting unit has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our income tax provisions and in evaluating our tax return positions 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
fin  we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe it is more likely than not a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  if examined  would be challenged and that we may not prevail 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements and are referred to as timing differences 
in addition  some expenses are not deductible on our tax return and are referred to as permanent differences 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the benefit in our income statement 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent deductions we have taken on our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements 
we have not recognized any united states tax expense on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since we intend to reinvest the earnings outside the us for the foreseeable future 
these undistributed earnings totaled approximately million at september  annually we evaluate the capital requirements in our foreign subsidiaries and determine the amount of excess capital  if any  that is available for distribution 
whether or not we actually repatriate the excess capital in the form of a dividend  we would provide for us taxes on the amount determined to be available for distribution 
this evaluation is judgmental in nature and  therefore  the amount of us taxes provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries is affected by these judgments 
based on th is analysis in  we determined that million british pounds million was excess capital in the uk and that million new zealand dollars million was excess capital in new zealand and paid dividends in these amounts to the us parent company 
us taxes provided on these dividends amounted to million in valuation of goodwill we evaluate our recorded goodwill balances for potential impairment annually by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including recorded goodwill 
our annual testing date is june we have not yet had a case where the carrying value exceeded the fair value  however  if it did  impairment would be measured by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value  and any impairment determined would be recorded in the current period 
to date there has been no impairment of our recorded goodwill 
goodwill balances by reporting unit are as follows september  in millions defense systems and products defense services transportation systems total goodwill determining the fair value of a reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and involves the use of estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
we currently perform internal valuation analysis and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparisons with recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows  discount rate reflecting the inherent risk in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate and determination of appropriate market comparables 
for fiscal  the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete three year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the three year discrete forecasts were estimated based on projected growth rates and financial ratios  influenced by an analysis of historical ratios  and by calculating a terminal value at the end of ten years 
the compound annual growth rates for sales ranged from to and for operating profit margins ranged from to for the reporting units  beyond the discrete forecast period 
the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of 
we did not recognize any goodwill impairment as a result of performing this annual test 
changes in estimates and assumptions we make in conducting our goodwill assessment could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period 
however  a decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our reporting units at june  would not have resulted in a goodwill impairment charge 
pension costs the measurement of our pension obligations and costs is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates inflation  salary growth expected return on plan assets retirement rates  mortality rates we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on high quality corporate long term bonds 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience in relation to the inflation assumption 
the expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations  our historical experience  our investment strategy and the views of investment managers and large pension sponsors 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods 
changes in the above assumptions can affect our financial statements  although the relatively small size of our defined benefit pension plans in relation to the size of the company limit the impact any individual assu mption changes can have 
for example  a basis point change in the assumed rate of return on assets would have changed the pension expense recorded in by about million  before applicable income taxes

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we invest in money market instruments and short term marketable debt securities that are tied to floating interest rates being offered at the time the investment is made 
we maintain short term borrowing arrangements in the us  us and new zealand which are also tied to floating interest rates libor and the us prime rate and the us and new zealand base rates 
we also have senior unsecured notes payable to insurance companies that are due in annual installments 
these notes have fixed coupon interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
interest income earned on our short term investments is affected by changes in the general level of us and us interest rates 
these income streams are generally not hedged 
interest expense incurred under the short term borrowing arrangements is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  us and new zealand 
the expense related to these cost streams is usually not hedged since it is either revolving  payable within three months and or immediately callable by the lender at any time 
interest expense incurred under the long term notes payable is not affected by changes in any interest rate because it is fixed 
however  we have in the past  and may in the future  use an interest rate swap to essentially convert this fixed rate into a floating rate for some or all of the long term debt outstanding 
the purpose of a swap would be to tie the interest expense risk related to these borrowings to the interest income risk on our short term investments  thereby mitigating our net interest rate risk 
we believe that we are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk at this point in time 
there was no interest rate swap outstanding at september  foreign currency exchange risk in the ordinary course of business  we enter into firm sale and purchase commitments denominated in many foreign currencies 
we have a policy to hedge those commitments greater than  by using foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary responsible for the commitment  typically the british pound  canadian dollar  singapore dollar  euro  swedish krona  new zealand dollar and australian dollar 
these contracts are designed to be effective hedges regardless of the direction or magnitude of any foreign currency exchange rate change  because they result in an equal and opposite income or cost stream that offsets the change in the value of the underlying commitment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our foreign currency translation and transaction accounting policies 
we also use balance sheet hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
this strategy involves incurring british pound denominated debt see interest rate risk above and having the option of paying off the debt using us dollar or british pound funds 
we do not believe that we are significantly exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk at this point in time 
investments in our foreign subsidiaries in the uk  australia  new zealand  and canada are not hedged because we consider them to be invested indefinitely 
in addition  we generally have control over the timing and amount of earnings repatriation  if any  and expect to use this control to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk
