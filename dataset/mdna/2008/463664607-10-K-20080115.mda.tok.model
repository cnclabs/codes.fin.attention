table of contents part i item business general we are a vision systems company enabled by proprietary technology for three dimensional packaging of electronics and manufacturing of electro optical products 
we design  develop  manufacture and sell vision systems and miniaturized electronic products for defense  security and commercial applications 
we also perform customer funded contract research and development related to these products  mostly for us government customers or prime contractors 
most of our historical business relates to application of our proprietary technologies for stacking either packaged or unpackaged semiconductors into more compact three dimensional forms  which we believe offer volume  power  weight and operational advantages over competing packaging approaches  and which we believe allows us to offer proprietary higher level products with unique operational features 
in december  we completed the initial acquisition the initial acquisition of of the outstanding capital stock of optex systems  inc  a privately held manufacturer of telescopes  periscopes  lenses and other optical systems and instruments whose customers are primarily agencies of and prime contractors to the us government 
in consideration for the initial acquisition  we made an initial cash payment to the sole shareholder of optex  timothy looney  in the amount of million and made an additional cash payment of  to mr 
looney in july upon completion of the audit of optex s financial statements for the year ended december  as additional consideration  we were initially required to pay to mr 
looney cash earnout payments in the aggregate amount up to million based upon the net cash generated from the optex business  after debt service  for the fiscal year ended october  fiscal and the next two subsequent fiscal years 
mr 
looney was not entitled to any earnout payments for fiscal or for the fiscal year ended september  fiscal 
in january  we negotiated an amendment to our earnout agreement with mr 
looney that extended his earnout period to december and reduced the aggregate maximum earnout by  to million in consideration for a secured subordinated term loan providing for advances from an entity owned by mr 
looney to optex of up to million 
this term loan bears interest at per annum and matures on the earlier of february or days after repayment of our senior debt 
as of september   this term loan was fully advanced to optex 
in connection with the initial acquisition  we entered into an agreement with mr 
looney  pursuant to which we agreed to purchase the remaining of the capital stock of optex held by mr 
looney the buyer option  subject to stockholder approval  which approval was received in june on december   we amended certain of our agreements with mr 
looney regarding the buyer option 
in consideration for such amendments  we issued a one year unsecured subordinated promissory note to mr 
looney in the principal amount of  bearing interest at a rate of per annum 
we exercised the buyer option on december  and issued mr 
looney  shares of our common stock as consideration for our purchase of the remaining of the outstanding common stock of optex held by him 
as a result of the initial acquisition and exercise of the buyer option  optex is now our wholly owned subsidiary 
optex s manufactures opto mechanical and electro optical products  which range from simple subassemblies to complex systems and are typically built pursuant to customer supplied designs 
many of its products are sold pursuant to multi year  fixed price contracts  with pre negotiated cost inflation features  that are procured competitively by the military services or by prime contractors to the military services 
optex had product sales of approximately million in calendar year for the three quarters of fiscal subsequent to the initial acquisition  optex had approximately million in product sales 
in fiscal  optex had approximately million of product sales 
in recent years  optex s product sales from sales to prime contractors has increased 
the decline in optex s annualized sales in fiscal reflects working capital limitations and related adverse supply chain effects  however  backlog at optex currently remains strong 
as of september   optex s funded backlog was approximately million  more than a majority of which is anticipated to be filled during fiscal 
table of contents we financed the initial acquisition of optex by a combination of million of senior secured debt from square bank under a term loan and million of senior subordinated secured convertible notes from two private equity funds  which are sometimes referred to in this report collectively as pequot 
in december  both of these obligations were refinanced with two new senior lenders 
these transactions resulted in approximately million of non recurring debt extinguishment expenses  which were largely non cash  and approximately million of future additional interest expense resulting from debt discounts and issuance costs 
in november  we restructured these obligations  as well as a short term million debt obligation to our senior lenders  to extend the maturity date of all of such obligations  including the related interest  to december  in consideration for a restructuring fee of approximately million  which fee is also payable december  except for fiscal years through when we generated significant commercial product sales of wireless infrared transceivers through a subsidiary  and prior to our acquisition of optex  we historically derived a substantial majority of our total revenues from government funded research and development rather than from product sales 
optex has also historically derived most of its revenues from product sales to government agencies or prime contractors 
accordingly  we anticipate that a substantial majority of our total revenues will continue to be derived from government funded sources in the immediately foreseeable future 
prior to the fiscal year ended october  fiscal  with a few exceptions  our government funded research and development contracts were largely early stage in nature and relatively modest in size 
as a result  our revenues from this source were not significantly affected by changes in the us defense budget 
in fiscal  we received several contract awards that we believe may have the potential eventually to lead to government production contracts  which we believe could be both larger and more profitable than government funded research and development contracts 
as a result  our contract research and development revenues improved to a substantial degree in fiscal our contract research and development revenues for fiscal and fiscal did not reach the levels achieved in fiscal primarily due to procurement delays in contracts that were eventually received later than expected 
however  the contribution to our contract research and development revenue from contract awards that we believe have the potential to lead to government production contracts continued at an increased level in fiscal and fiscal from that achieved in years prior to fiscal our current marketing efforts are focused on government programs that we believe have the potential to substantially sustain this focus on opportunities with the possibility of transition to government production contracts 
because of this focus and our acquisition of optex  our future revenues may become more dependent upon us defense budgets  funding approvals and political agendas for the foreseeable future 
we are also attempting to increase our revenues from product sales by introducing new products with commercial applications  in particular  miniaturized cameras and stacked computer memory chips 
we are currently transitioning to a new generation of such products  with a view to increasing our product sales  but we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete development  successfully launch or profitably manufacture and sell any such products on a timely basis  if at all 
we generally use contract manufacturers to produce these products  and all of our other current operations  except those of optex  occur at a single  leased facility in costa mesa  california 
optex manufactures its products at its leased facility in richardson  texas 
we have a history of unprofitable operations due in part to discretionary investments that we have made to commercialize our technologies and to maintain our technical staff and corporate infrastructure at levels that we believed were required for future growth 
these investments have yet to produce profitable operating results 
with respect to our investments in staff and infrastructure  the advanced technical and multi disciplinary content of our proprietary technologies places a premium on a stable and well trained work force 
as a result  we generally maintain the size of our work force even when anticipated government contracts are delayed  a circumstance that has occurred with some frequency in the past and that has resulted in under utilization of our labor force for revenue generation from time to time 
delays in receipt of research and development contracts are unpredictable  but we believe such delays represent a recurring characteristic of our research and development contract business 
we anticipate that the impact on our business of future delays can be mitigated by the achievement of greater contract backlog and are seeking growth in our research and development contract revenue to that end 
we are also seeking to expand the contribution to our total revenues from product sales  which have not historically experienced the same types of delays that can occur in research and development contracts 
we have not yet demonstrated the level of sustained research and development contract revenue or product sales that we believe is required to achieve profitable operations 
our ability to recover our investments through the cost reimbursement features of our government contracts is constrained due to both regulatory and competitive pricing considerations 

table of contents to offset the adverse working capital effect of our net losses  we have historically financed our operations through issuance of various equity instruments 
to finance the acquisition of optex  we also incurred material long term debt  a substantial portion of which is convertible into our common stock 
in the last five fiscal years  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock  an increase of approximately over the approximately million shares of our common stock outstanding at the beginning of that period  and a substantial dilution of stockholder interests 
of these issuances  approximately million shares were as a result of partial conversion of our debt incurred for the acquisition of the initial of optex and approximately million shares were to acquire the remaining of optex 
at september   our fully diluted common stock position was approximately million shares 
at september   we had approximately million of debt  exclusive of debt discounts 
in the past  we maintained separate operating business units  including our subsidiaries that were separately managed  with independent product development  marketing and distribution capabilities 
however  during the fiscal year ended september  fiscal  we reorganized our operations to consolidate our administrative  marketing and engineering resources and to reduce expenses 
in the fiscal year ended october  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  none of our previous historical subsidiaries accounted for more than of our total revenues 
however  optex accounted for approximately of our total revenues in fiscal  even though it contributed to our total revenues for only three fiscal quarters  and accounted for approximately of our total revenues in fiscal optex is expected to continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenues in subsequent reporting periods 
none of our subsidiaries except optex accounted for more than of our total assets at september  or have separate employees or facilities 
we currently report our operating results and financial condition in two operating segments  our research and development business and our product business 
in fiscal  we discontinued the operations of our novalog subsidiary 
we have restated all financial statements and schedules of the company to give effect to this discontinuation and report novalog as a discontinued operation 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
isc was incorporated in california in december and was reincorporated in delaware in january our principal executive offices are located at red hill avenue  building  costa mesa  california our telephone number is and our website is www 
irvine sensors 
com 
the inclusion of our website address in this report does not include or incorporate by reference the information on our web site into this report 
isc subsidiaries we historically sought to commercialize some of our technologies by creating independently managed subsidiaries that could pursue their own financing strategies separately from isc  including novalog  inc novalog  which developed and sold serial infrared communication chips and modules microsensors  inc msi  which developed miniaturized inertial sensors and an application specific integrated circuit asic for readout of sensors  redhawk vision  inc redhawk  which developed and sold proprietary software for extracting still photographs from video sources  and inetworks corporation inetworks  which developed proprietary technology related to internet routing 
all of these historical subsidiaries still exist as separate legal entities  but none of them presently have separate operations due to a reorganization in fiscal we manage and are still seeking licensing relationships and third party strategic partners to further the potential commercial exploitation of some of the technologies developed by our historical subsidiaries 
however  because of the difficulty of securing economic sources of supply for our wireless infrared products  we discontinued operations of our novalog subsidiary in the latter part of fiscal the financial statements included in this report reflect the reclassification of novalog as a discontinued operation for both the current and prior fiscal years 
our optex subsidiary is a separate legal entity 
as of september   our ownership of the issued and outstanding capital stock of novalog  msi  redhawk  inetworks and optex was approximately    and  respectively 
john c 
carson  our chief executive officer and a director  also serves as chief executive officer of all of our subsidiaries except inetworks and optex 
mel brashears  who is our chairman of the board  is the chief executive officer of inetworks as an independent consultant 
optex does not currently have a chief executive officer 
peter kenefick  a vice president of the company  serves as optex s general manager 
john stuart  our chief financial officer  
table of contents serves as the chief financial officer of each of our subsidiaries 
mr 
carson and mr 
stuart serve as directors of each of our subsidiaries 
novalog  msi  redhawk and inetworks all have substantial intercompany debts payable to isc 
at september   the amount of these intercompany obligations were approximately million  million  million and million for novalog  msi  redhawk and inetworks  respectively 
the obligations are not interest bearing and contain no conversion rights 
isc could elect to cancel some of the indebtedness from novalog as consideration to exercise outstanding warrants to purchase up to million shares of novalog s common stock at the exercise price of per share and to cancel some of the indebtedness from msi as consideration to exercise outstanding warrants to purchase up to million shares of msi s common stock at the exercise price of per share 
given the discontinuation of novalog s operations and the licensing only nature of msi s current operations  we do not presently consider either of these permissible warrant exercises to be likely in the foreseeable future 
products and technologies as a result both of our externally funded contracts and our internally funded research and development  we have developed a wide variety of technologies derived from or related to the field of three dimensional chip stacking 
in turn  we have developed a number of products based on these technologies for use at various levels of system integration 
our optex subsidiary manufactures a variety of optical products for military agencies and prime contractors  largely for installation on vehicles  based on designs owned by and provided by those customers 
we are currently offering products in the following areas stacked chip assemblies 
we have developed a family of standard products consisting of stacked memory chips that are used for numerous applications  both governmental and commercial 
our technology is applicable to stacking of a variety of microchips  both packaged and unpackaged  that we believe can offer demonstrable benefits to designers of systems that incorporate numerous integrated circuits  both memory and otherwise  by improving speed and reducing size  weight and power usage 
in addition  since our technology reduces the number of interconnections between chips  we believe potential system failure points can also be reduced through chip stacking 
we anticipate that the features achievable with our chip stacking technology could have applications in space and in aircraft applications where weight and volume considerations are dominant  as well as in various other commercial and governmental applications in which portability is required and speed is important 
we have introduced a number of stacked chip products that are primarily oriented toward the needs of potential commercial customers who are seeking to emulate the performance of advanced monolithic memory chip packages through the stacking of two or more prior generation packages 
we believe this approach can offer economic advantages because of the high costs of advanced monolithic chip packages during early phases of the monolithic product lifetime 
these types of stacked chip package products are also available from competitors  but we believe that our chip package stacking technology has advantages in terms of board space utilized and performance over that of competitors 
since our introduction of such products  we have achieved limited market penetration  primarily for non commercial applications  although we have qualified and sold such products for commercial applications as well 
we believe that the demand for stacked chips in industry standard thin small outline packages tsops  in which lead frames are used to attach chip packages to circuit boards  is mature  at best  and may be in decline 
in fiscal  we announced the qualification of a process for converting tsops and ball grid array bga chips into stacks with bga solder ball connections for board mounting  which we believe can address emerging demand for stacked chip assemblies using more space efficient attachment technology 
we believe that an industry transition from tsops to bgas may broaden our prospects for commercial market penetration  although we cannot guarantee that outcome 
customer demand for enhanced performance of electronic systems has produced a wide variety of competitors and competitive systems offering higher density microelectronics ranging from various three dimensional designs to highly dense two dimensional designs 
although some of our competitors are better financed  more experienced and organizationally stronger than us  we are not aware of any system in 
table of contents existence or under development that can stack chips more densely than our three dimensional approach 
see business competition 
miniaturized infrared cameras 
several of our research and development contracts have involved the miniaturization of imaging devices  particularly those using infrared detectors that create images by sensing the heat emitted by objects being viewed 
we believe such technology is directly applicable to applications requiring vision at night or in smoke filled environments 
our initial product development using this technology has focused on low power  rugged infrared cameras for military  security and surveillance applications 
the combination of our miniaturization capabilities with the advanced electronic packaging available using our chip stacking has led to the development of virtually instant on infrared cameras and thermal imagers and a related personal miniature thermal viewer tm or pmtv tm that we believe has overcome limitations of competitive approaches 
we have shipped such products to several customers for use in military applications 
we also intend to market products utilizing this core technology in potential commercial applications such as thermal viewers for firefighters 
miniaturized visible spectrum cameras 
as a result of our miniaturized infrared camera activities  we have also established relationships with suppliers and potential customers for miniaturized cameras that are designed to operate in illumination visible to the human eye 
such cameras are in active development by various suppliers to meet new driver and passenger seat monitoring requirements for automobiles  among other uses 
although we are not currently providing products for the automotive markets  we have developed and are currently selling visible spectrum cameras to a variety of original equipment manufacturers  or oems  for potential use in other applications 
our sales of these cameras to date have largely been for evaluation and qualification purposes  although we have shipped limited production quantities of our miniaturized visible spectrum camera to one oem 
microchips and sensors 
through our msi subsidiary  we introduced asic readout chips for manufacturers of micromachined products who require low noise electronic readout circuitry 
we have shipped engineering samples  qualification volumes and small production volumes of such chips to various customers through isc 
msi also developed a proprietary inertial sensor  the silicon microring gyro tm  which is intended to provide an inexpensive means to measure rotational motion for a wide variety of potential applications 
in september  a united states patent  assigned to msi  was granted covering the design of the silicon microring gyro 
we expect that the commercial exploitation  if any  of the silicon microring gyro will be paced by product design in lead times of customers  principally oems 
similarly  msi has also developed a proprietary axis silicon accelerometer that is also dependent on oem schedule considerations 
we have granted a perpetual license to msi s gyro and accelerometer technology to a third party  with exclusivity subject to minimum royalty obligations  for further development targeted for automotive and certain aerospace applications 
while this license has not generated any royalties to date  the licensee has advised us that one or more automotive oems are developing products incorporating msi s technologies  however  we cannot guarantee that any such products will be introduced or that they will achieve broad market acceptance 
msi is not actively pursuing further development of this technology on its own 
accordingly  we are currently unable to project when  or if  we might receive material revenues from the license of our gyro and accelerometer technologies 
software 
we formed our redhawk subsidiary to exploit our proprietary software technology for extracting quality still photographs from any video source 
we achieved limited sales of a software product based on this technology that was favorably reviewed by professional users  but did not achieve broad market acceptance 
we no longer offer this product 
we have sought  but have not secured  strategic relationships to exploit this software technology and cannot assure you that any endeavors in this behalf will be successful in the future 
to date  redhawk has not generated any significant revenues 
optex s products 
optex manufactures and sells high quality sighting systems and optical assemblies for military applications 
optex s assembly efforts range from simple subassemblies to complex systems composed of opto mechanical and electro optical components 
optex s products include optically improved tank periscopes  muzzle reference sensors  back up sights  rifle sights  ship binoculars  and a range of sighting systems and assembly components 
optex s products are used on major us armored vehicle programs 
table of contents including the m main battle tank  bradley fighting vehicle  m tank  light armor vehicle  stryker light armor vehicle  mobile gun system  armor security vehicle  amphibious assault vehicle  and the efficient fighting vehicle 
optex s products are also used on south korea s k tank 
further  optex plays a significant role in several us and foreign programs involving night vision rifle sights 
potential product applications embedded systems 
in fiscal  we commenced exploration of a technology to stack chips of different functionality and dimensions within the same chip stack  in effect creating a complete  miniaturized electronic system that can be embedded in a higher level product 
we refer to this technology as neostack 
tm in fiscal  a us patent was granted on our neostack technology 
we initially demonstrated our neostack technology to support a government program to develop a wearable computer 
we are presently developing potential commercial applications of this technology under other government contracts 
we believe  but cannot assure  that our neostack approach will offer advantages in terms of compactness and power consumption to developers of a wide variety of embedded computer and control systems 
however  we have not yet developed this technology to the point at which we can make forecasts of potential revenue  if any  resulting from our licensing to or application by oems 
active imaging systems 
many of the potential government applications for which we have received developmental funding over the years have involved advanced techniques for acquiring and interpreting images 
in fiscal  an industry team that we formed and led  and one other industry team  won an open competition to design an advanced imaging system based on the integration of laser pulse returns to allow the extraction of images of objects concealed by foliage 
the prototype units built under this contract were successfully demonstrated in fiscal in fiscal and fiscal  we received additional development contract funding for other uses of this technology 
in fiscal  we successfully developed and delivered a space based active imaging system that has been deployed and  in fiscal  received a contract to develop another such system 
we have received additional contract awards for related projects that may help us to further explore active imaging product applications 
application specific electronic systems 
we have developed a number of application specific electronic systems to prototype status under various government development contracts 
potential applications include physical and electronic security  visible spectrum cameras  and biomedical instrumentation and monitoring 
we are seeking government and commercial sponsors or partners to advance these developments to product status  but we cannot guarantee our success in these endeavors 
cognitive systems 
we have received a number of contracts from government agencies regarding the development of cognitive systems employing artificial neural networks and applications thereof 
neural networks contain large numbers of processing nodes that continuously interact with each other  similar to the way that the neurons of a human brain interact to process sensory stimuli 
neural networks are the subject of scientific inquiry because pattern recognition and learning tasks  which humans perform well  and computers perform poorly  appear to be dependent on such processing 
neither conventional computers nor advanced parallel processors currently have the interconnectivity needed to emulate neural network processing techniques 
we received approximately million cumulatively of government research and development contracts in fiscal and intended to advance the maturity of the technologies required for cognitive sensors employing neural networks 
we are presently pursuing additional government research and development contracts to provide demonstration products to various branches of the department of defense incorporating this technology 
we believe our chip stacking technologies could provide a way to achieve the very high levels of interconnectivity necessary to construct an efficient artificial neural network 
while the full embodiment of our neural network technology is expected to be years away  if at all  we intend to continue to pursue research and development in this area in order to broaden the potential product application of the technology 
infrared sensors 
the focus of our original government funded research and development and much of our subsequent follow on contract awards has been in the field of government applications of infrared sensors 
we intend to continue to pursue such contracts with the goal of developing and selling infrared sensors for surveillance  acquisition  tracking and interception applications for a variety of department of defense applications and nasa missions 

table of contents manufacturing our costa mesa operation primarily uses contract manufacturers to fabricate and assemble our stacked chip  microchip and sensor products 
at our current limited levels of sales of these products  we typically use single contract manufacturing sources for such products and  as a result  we are vulnerable to disruptions in supply 
however  for these single sourced products  we use semiconductor fabrication and related manufacturing sources that we believe are widely available 
we currently manufacture our thermal camera and software products ourselves  given their relatively low volumes 
we have started to expand our manufacturing capacity for such products 
our manufacturing activities for thermal camera products primarily consist of assembly  calibration and test 
we use contract manufacturers for production of our visible camera products  except for final testing  which we perform ourselves 
our various thermal and visible camera products presently rely on a limited number of suppliers of imaging chips that are adequate for the quality and performance requirements of our products  which makes us vulnerable to potential disruptions in supply 
our original bare chip stacking technology involves a standard manufacturing process that fabricates cubes comprising multiple die layers along with ceramic cap and base substrates laminated with an extremely thin non silicon layer and interconnected with a thin film bus metallization to bring the chip input output signals out to the top surface of the stacks 
the cubes can then be segmented or split into subsections as required for the particular product configuration being built 
finally  the cubes  mini cubes or short stacks are burned in  tested  graded  kitted for packaging  out sourced for packaging and screening  and returned for final test 
our facility is designed for low volume and prototype production of such parts 
we have also developed an advanced process of ultra high density stacking in which we first embed more than one bare chip or supporting electronics component in an adhesive layer  thereby creating what we refer to as a neo chip 
tm we then use manufacturing processes similar to our original bare chip stacking technology to stack these neo chips  resulting in a neo stack 
in the last several years  we have introduced what we believe are more cost competitive stacked packaged chip products that are manufactured with current state of the art manufacturing technologies 
some of our newer products use manufacturing processes that are designed to also be compatible with stacking of neo chip products in the future 
we use independent third party qualified source vendors for the manufacturing of these products 
we currently have no long term manufacturing contracts for any of our products 
the primary components of our camera products are integrated circuits and detectors 
we typically design the integrated circuits for manufacture by third parties from silicon wafers and other materials readily available from multiple sources 
while we do not have any long term arrangements with suppliers for the purchase of these materials  we believe we will have sufficient capacity to address our near term manufacturing needs 
because of the nature of the sophisticated work performed under our research and development contracts  we design and assemble equipment for testing and prototype development 
we also use this equipment to seek  qualify for and perform additional contract research and development for our customers 
optex manufactures its own products in its leased facilities in richardson  texas  largely through assembly of parts that are available from a variety of sources 
optex s largest suppliers are litton electro optical systems  hoya optics  qioptiq imaging solutions and spartech corporation 
backlog funded backlog includes amounts under contracts that have been awarded to us and for which we have authority to bill for work under such contracts 
at november   our consolidated funded backlog was approximately million compared to approximately million at november  approximately million of the funded backlog at november  was related to optex s product orders 
we expect that more than a majority of our funded backlog at november  will result in revenue recognized in the fiscal year ending september  fiscal 
in addition  we have unfunded backlog on contracts that we have won  but that have not yet been fully funded  in which funding increments are expected to be received when the previously funded amounts have been expended 
we are also continuing to negotiate for additional research contracts and commercial product sales 
many of these proposals for additional research contracts are submitted 
table of contents under the small business innovation research  or sbir  provisions of all government agencies that conduct funded research and development 
in the past  we have submitted approximately or more phase sbir proposals in any given fiscal year  and between approximately five and ten of those proposals have historically led to initial contract awards generally valued between  to  each 
of those phase contracts  approximately half of them have historically resulted in follow on phase awards  usually valued between  to million each 
in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  we generated approximately million  million and million  respectively  of funded contract revenue from these proposals 
although our reliance on sbir contracts as a revenue source has declined somewhat as our contracts procured through other channels have increased  we continue to view sbir contracts as an important source of both revenues and technology improvement 
however  we cannot guarantee you that future sbir contracts will be awarded  or if awarded  will match or exceed our historical experience or that such contract awards will be profitable or lead to other projects 
we may not be successful in securing any additional sbir contract awards in the future 
failure to continue to obtain these sbir awards and other funded research and development contracts in a timely manner  or at all  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
customers and marketing historically  we have primarily focused our marketing of research and development contracts directly on us government agencies or contractors to those agencies 
we intend to continue to seek and prepare proposals for additional contracts from such sources 
we also develop potential non military uses of our technology 
we believe that there will be more emphasis and funds directed to advanced technology systems and research programs for which we are qualified to compete 
we believe that we are well positioned to compete for some potential programs of this nature  although we cannot guarantee our success 
we market our stacked  packaged memory products to both aerospace and commercial users of such devices  at both oems and component manufacturers 
we have only achieved modest success in receiving production orders for our stacked  packaged memory products from commercial customers 
we have marketing staff with relevant industry experience for these products  but do not yet have sufficient history to predict our potential penetration of commercial opportunities in this area 
we believe that our development of miniaturized infrared cameras and related thermal viewers may offer us prospects for penetration of new product markets in the future 
to that end  in fiscal  we announced initial availability of such products and started to devote more marketing emphasis to us government agencies that are end users of such products 
we completed further development of such products under government contract in fiscal we increased our marketing of such products in fiscal  resulting in initial production orders received late in that fiscal year and additional orders in fiscal we expect to continue this increased marketing emphasis on such products in fiscal our microchip products are generally marketed directly to oems with which we have established vendor relationships 
our related inertial sensors  namely gyros and accelerometers  are marketed through our licensee of such products  with an initial emphasis on automotive applications 
optex markets its products through direct contact with us military agencies and their prime contractors and responds to requests for bids from the same 
in fiscal  direct contracts with various military services and branches of the us government accounted for approximately of our total revenues and second tier government contracts with prime government contractors accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
the remaining approximately of our total revenues was derived from non government sources 
during fiscal  revenues derived from the us army  the us air force and general dynamics  a government contractor  accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues  respectively 
loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
no other customer accounted for more than of our total revenues for fiscal 
table of contents contracts with government agencies may be suspended or terminated by the government at any time  subject to certain conditions 
similar termination provisions are typically included in agreements with prime contractors 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience suspensions or terminations in the future 
we focus marketing in specific areas of interest in order to best use our relatively limited marketing resources 
with our de emphasis on subsidiaries and emphasis on reintegration of subsidiary operations  we are managing our marketing through centralized coordination of the lead individuals with specific responsibilities for our different product families 
competition the demand for high performance semiconductors has produced a wide variety of competitors and competitive systems  ranging from various three dimensional designs to highly dense two dimensional designs 
for most commercial applications  the principal competitive factor is cost  although we believe operating speed is increasingly becoming a factor 
for some applications in which volume and weight are critical  such as space or avionics  we believe density is the principal competitive factor 
we believe that many of our competitors are better financed  more experienced and have more extensive support infrastructure than us 
accordingly  we may not be able to successfully compete in such markets in the future 
we are aware of two primary competitors that have developed or acquired competing approaches to high density chip stacking d plus and vertical circuits  inc in addition  there are several independent companies such as staktek corporation  dst modules  and tessera technologies and divisions of large companies that have various competitive technologies for stacking a limited number of chips in packaged form 
we are also aware of many companies that are currently servicing the military market for electro optical sensors of the type that our products are also designed to support 
we believe the principal competitive factor in this business area is the performance sensitivity and selectivity achievable by alternative sensor approaches and designs 
our primary competitors in this area include texas instruments  inc  lockheed martin corporation  l communications  northrop grumman  bae systems  eg g judson  optoelectronics textron  inc and boeing corporation 
we believe that most of our competitors in this area have greater financial  labor and capital resources than us  and accordingly  we may not be able to compete successfully in this market 
we believe that our major competitors for miniaturized infrared camera products are flir systems  inc  indigo operations and insight technology  inc we believe that our current miniaturized infrared camera product has some size  weight and power advantages over comparable products of these competitors  but both of these competitors have greater financial  labor and capital resources than us  and accordingly  we may not be able to compete successfully in this market 
since the products sold by optex are largely of a build to print nature  there are a number of companies that could potentially be its competitors 
we believe that optex s principal existing competitors are miller hollzwarth  seiler instruments and selectron 
we believe that the principal competitive factors relating to optex s business are price and delivery reliability  both areas in which we believe optex has achieved a strong reputation 
research and development we believe that government and commercial research contracts will provide a portion of the funding necessary for continuing development of some of our products 
however  the manufacture of stacked circuitry modules in volume will require substantial additional funds  which may involve additional equity or debt financing or a joint venture  license or other arrangement 
furthermore  the development of some of the products originated in our subsidiaries is likely to require substantial external funding 
we cannot assure you that sufficient funding will be available from government or other sources or that we will successfully develop new products for volume production 
our consolidated research and development expenses for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were approximately   million and million  respectively 
these expenditures were in addition to the cost of revenues associated with our customer sponsored research and development activities 
the greater spending level of our own funds on research and development in fiscal and fiscal  as opposed to fiscal 
table of contents  was partly due to our deployment of under utilized direct personnel to such activities during periods when government contracts were delayed 
we have historically funded our research and development activities primarily through contracts with the federal government and with funds from our public and private stock offerings 
patents  trademarks and licenses we primarily protect our proprietary technology by seeking to obtain  where practical  patents on the inventions made by our employees 
as of september   currently effective us and foreign patents have been issued and other us patent applications are pending 
foreign patent applications corresponding to several of the us patents and patent applications are also pending 
five of the us patents  covering early versions of our stacking technology  expire in less than two years 
we do not believe that these expirations will have a material effect on our current business and results of operations 
the balance of our stacking patents  including those covering the stacking technologies that are the basis of our current products and product development  have durations ranging from over two to over years 
we also have patents on a variety of collateral technologies that we developed to support  facilitate or utilize our stacking technologies 
those patents have durations ranging from less than one year to over years 
the patent covering certain circuit technology embodied in our wireless infrared products has a remaining duration of slightly less than seven years 
we cannot assure you that any additional patents will be issued in the us or elsewhere 
moreover  the issuance of a patent does not carry any assurance of successful application  commercial success or adequate protection 
we cannot assure you that our existing patents or any other patent that may issue in the future will be upheld if we seek enforcement of our patent rights against an infringer or that we will have sufficient resources to prosecute our rights 
we also cannot assure you that our patents will provide meaningful protection from competition 
in addition  if others were to assert that we are using technology covered by patents held by them  we would evaluate the necessity and desirability of seeking a license from the patent holder 
we cannot assure you that we are not infringing on other patents or that we could obtain a license if we were so infringing 
the products and improvements that we develop under government contracts are generally subject to royalty free use by the government for government applications 
however  we have negotiated certain non space exclusions in government contracts and have the right to file for patent protection on commercial products that may result from government funded research and development activities 
in february  we entered into an assignment of patent and intellectual rights agreement with fk eide  a retired employee who was formerly our vice president 
as part of an employment agreement  mr 
eide assigned to us all rights and interests to five us provisional patent applications owned by him 
those applications subsequently resulted in three issued us patents assigned to us covering various chip package stacking techniques 
in consideration for this assignment  mr 
eide receives a royalty on the gross sales revenues  if any  of any products incorporating the technology of these patent assignments for the lifetime of these patents 
we have granted a perpetual license to msi s gyro and accelerometer technology to a third party  with exclusivity subject to minimum royalty obligations  for further development of this technology targeted for automotive and certain aerospace applications 
to date  this license has not generated any material royalties  and we cannot assure you that it will generate any material royalties in the future 
certification standard in october  our business and quality management systems were certified to be compliant with the international organization for standardization iso standard 
in november and again in may  audits of our costa mesa operations reaffirmed our certification to this standard 
employees as of december   at our costa mesa  california facilities we had full time employees and five consultants 
of the full time employees  were engaged in engineering  production and technical support and were engaged in sales  marketing and administration 
as of december   at our richardson  texas facility we 
table of contents had full time employees and temporary full time employees subject to day probationary employment prior to potential hire 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union  and we have experienced no work stoppages due to labor problems 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
item a 
risk factors our future operating results are highly uncertain 
before deciding to invest in our common stock or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in our annual report on form k  and in our other filings with the sec  including any subsequent reports filed on forms q and k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business and results of operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our independent public auditing firm has issued a going concern opinion  which raises doubts about our ability to continue as a viable entity 
our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to further implement our business plan  raise additional capital and fulfill our backlog 
absent firm commitments for additional financing  these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we expect that we will need to raise additional capital in the future  additional funds may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
in addition to our significant net losses in recent periods  we have also historically experienced negative cash flows  from operations or other uses of cash 
due largely to our capital expenditures  we experienced a net reduction of our cash during fiscal of approximately  in fiscal  due largely to debt service related to the initial acquisition of optex  we experienced a net reduction in cash of  in fiscal  we had a modest increase in cash  largely due to financing activities  but used approximately million of cash in operating activities 
to offset the effect of negative net cash flows  we have historically funded a portion of our operations through multiple equity financings  and to a lesser extent through receivable financing 
in december  in order to finance the initial acquisition of optex  we obtained a million senior secured term loan and borrowed million of subordinated secured convertible notes 
we had to raise million in december to refinance the senior secured term loan and our million revolving line of credit and to enhance our working capital 
we entered into a short term promissory note  with a present principal value of million  with one of our senior lenders in july to further enhance our liquidity and were subsequently able to extend it to long term status in november  along with restructuring our other debt  but at a cost of an increase of an additional in our aggregate debt 
we anticipate we will have to raise additional capital in the future to service or retire our debt  remedy debt defaults  replace lenders and to finance our future working capital needs 
we cannot assure you that any additional capital will be available on a timely basis  on acceptable terms  or at all 
future financings may require stockholder approval  which may not be obtainable 
future equity financings may be difficult to obtain while we are ineligible to use form s and while the ability to register resales is subject to consent of our senior lenders 
if we are not able to obtain additional capital as may be required  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we anticipate that our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our ability to repay our existing debt  our ability to fulfill funded backlog at optex  our ability to procure additional production contracts and government research and development contracts  our ability to control costs  our ability to commercialize our technologies and achieve broad market acceptance for such technologies  the timing of payments and reimbursements from government and other contracts  research and development funding requirements  
table of contents increased sales and marketing expenses  technological advancements and competitors response to our products  capital improvements to new and existing facilities  the impact of our acquisition of optex and any additional acquisitions that we may complete  our relationships with customers and suppliers  and general economic conditions including the effects of future economic slowdowns  a slump in the semiconductor market  acts of war or terrorism and the current international conflicts 
even if available  financings can involve significant costs and expenses  such as legal and accounting fees  diversion of management s time and efforts  or substantial transaction costs or break up fees in certain instances 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  or at all  we may be unable to finance our operations  develop or enhance our products  expand our sales and marketing programs  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
our common stock may be delisted by the nasdaq capital market if we cannot maintain nasdaq s listing requirements 
in such case  the market for your shares may be limited  and it may be difficult for you to sell your shares at an acceptable price  if at all 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq capital market formerly known as the nasdaq smallcap market 
among other requirements  to maintain this listing  our common stock must continue to trade above per share 
in december  our stock had failed to meet this criterion for over consecutive trading days 
as a result  in accordance with marketplace rule c b  we were notified by nasdaq that we had calendar days or until june  to regain compliance with this rule by reestablishing a sales price of per share or greater for ten consecutive trading days 
in july  our stock had also failed to meet this criterion for over consecutive trading days 
our common stock has  at various times  traded close to or below the per share minimum standard  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to regain compliance again or that the sales price of our common stock will continue to meet nasdaq s minimum listing standards 
in addition to the price requirement  we must also meet at least one of the three following additional standards to maintain our nasdaq listing maintenance of stockholders equity at million or greater  maintenance of our market capitalization in excess of million as measured by market prices for trades executed on nasdaq  or net income from continuing operations of  in the latest fiscal year or two of the last three fiscal years 
in july  nasdaq notified us that we were deficient with respect to all of these additional standards based on our financial statements as of july  in august  nasdaq advised us that  based on updated information  we had reestablished compliance with the million market capitalization standard 
however  the subsequent decline in the price of our common stock resulted in another deficiency notice from nasdaq in august  for which compliance was subsequently reestablished 
in january  we received a nasdaq staff determination notifying us that we failed to comply with nasdaq marketplace rule c as a result of our failure to timely file our form k for the fiscal year ended october  as a result of such late filing and the receipt of such nasdaq staff determination  our series and series notes  our term loan with our new senior lenders  our  unsecured subordinated promissory note with mr 
looney and optex s million secured subordinated note with mr 
looney became in default 
we received waivers that cured these defaults  and we filed our form k on january  if we are untimely in filing our exchange act reports in the future and receive additional nasdaq staff determinations  we may experience additional defaults in the future under our outstanding debt instruments 
after we filed our form k on january   nasdaq notified us that we had regained compliance with nasdaq marketplace rule c  but we were notified by nasdaq in december that we no longer comply with nasdaq marketplace rule c  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to regain or maintain our compliance with nasdaq s requirements in the future 
the effect of the restatement of our fiscal balance sheet retrospectively caused our stockholders equity to be below the nasdaq listing requirement of stockholders equity of million or greater at october  when our market capitalization was also less than million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
this condition was cured by our december debt refinancing prior to the filing of our fiscal form k in january nonetheless  the cumulative effect of our restatement has 
table of contents substantially narrowed our margin for compliance with nasdaq stockholders equity listing requirements in the future 
if we fail to meet nasdaq listing requirements  our common stock could be delisted  which would eliminate the primary market for your shares of common stock and would result in additional defaults under our outstanding debt instruments 
as a result  you may not be able to sell your shares at an acceptable price  if at all 
in addition  such delisting may make it more difficult or expensive for us to raise additional capital in the future 
if we are delisted from the nasdaq capital market  your ability to sell your shares of our common stock would also be limited by the penny stock restrictions  which could further limit the marketability of your shares 
if our common stock is delisted  it would come within the definition of penny stock as defined in the securities exchange act of and would be covered by rule g of the securities exchange act of that rule imposes additional sales practice requirements on broker dealers who sell securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors 
for transactions covered by rule g  the broker dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale 
consequently  rule g  if it were to become applicable  would affect the ability or willingness of broker dealers to sell our securities  and accordingly would affect the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the public market 
these additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future 
the december refinancings and november restructuring of our senior and subordinated debt increased our aggregate debt and increased the dilutive effect of our convertible subordinated notes and related warrants  thereby increasing risks associated with the retirement of these obligations 
the december refinancing of our senior debt increased the amount of that obligation from approximately million to million at a slightly higher interest rate  all of which is due and payable in december  pursuant to a november restructuring of this debt 
the november restructuring of our debt also increased our total debt by approximately million for a restructuring fee and contingently increased our debt by an additional approximate million if we fail to retire our obligations to our senior lenders by december furthermore  the conversion price of our convertible subordinated notes and the exercise price of related warrants was reduced in the december refinancing  pursuant to the notes and warrants price anti dilution features  from per share to per share  which may impede our ability to raise additional capital to facilitate the retirement of our debt 
failure to satisfy our debt obligations would expose us to a variety of remedies available to our lenders  up to and including foreclosure on our assets 
our stock price could decline because of the potentially dilutive effect of future financings  conversions of notes  effect of anti dilution provisions or exercises of warrants and common stock options 
during the past three fiscal years  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock  largely to fund our operations and to acquire the remaining interest in optex  resulting in significant dilution to our existing stockholders 
at october   there were approximately million shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of warrants and options and upon the conversion of our subordinated secured convertible notes 
at september   due to the refinancing of our debt  this aggregate dilutive potential was approximately million shares 
any additional equity or convertible debt financings in the future could result in further dilution to our stockholders 
existing stockholders also will suffer significant dilution in ownership interests and voting rights  and our stock price could decline  as a result of potential future application of price anti dilution features of our subordinated convertible notes and the pequot warrants  if not waived by the note holders and warrant holders 
the december refinancings of our senior and subordinated debt have resulted in substantial cash and non cash expenses  which may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
the refinancing of our senior debt and convertible subordinated notes involved cash expenses in excess of million  including a million settlement fee paid to pequot  and very substantial non cash expenses because of the expense of new warrants and the redetermination of imputed interest associated with the subordinated convertible notes primarily resulting from those notes now containing a beneficial conversion feature 
significant cash expenses of the refinancing  including the million settlement fee  were recorded as expenses in fiscal  and the balance of the cash expenses and a substantial portion of the non cash expenses were recorded as expenses in fiscal and will continue to be recorded during the remaining term of the debt 
the expense associated with the new warrants will be amortized over the term of the debt 
these financial reporting impacts could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 

table of contents significant sales of our common stock in the public market will cause our stock price to fall 
as of september   we had approximately million shares of common stock outstanding  all but approximately million of which were freely tradable  other than restrictions imposed upon our affiliates 
in addition  approximately million shares of our common stock were issuable pursuant to outstanding options  warrants and convertible notes 
the average trading volume of our shares in september  however  was only approximately  shares per day 
accordingly  the freely tradable shares and those shares that are potentially issuable are significantly greater in number than the daily average trading volume of our shares 
if the holders of the freely tradable shares were to sell a significant amount of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
if we raise additional capital in the future through the sale of shares of our common stock to private investors  we may  subject to existing restrictions lapsing or being waived  agree to register these shares for resale on a registration statement as we have done in the past 
upon registration  these additional shares would become freely tradable once sold in the public market  assuming the prospectus delivery and other requirements were met by the sellers  and  if significant in amount  such sales could further adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the sale of a large number of shares of our common stock also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and at the prices that we deem appropriate 
the consolidation of our debt may have increased the likelihood that our debt could be accelerated 
the unanticipated delays that we experienced in receipts of new research and development contracts in fiscal resulted in our failure to comply with our bank debt covenants several times since the inception of our credit facility with our previous senior lender  square bank  and resulted in cross defaults under our subordinated secured convertible notes 
we renegotiated the covenants of our senior bank debt on the first of these occurrences but  as a result of subsequent occurrences  were required to refinance our senior bank debt  including the incorporation of our revolving line of credit into our senior term loan  to new senior lenders in december although the new senior lenders have waived the prior defaults and cross defaults associated with our original senior and subordinated debt  have waived the new financial condition default covenants associated with our new senior debt and have deferred our obligation to pay principal and interest until december  we cannot assure you that the variability in our contract business and the margins in our product business will allow us to retire our debt obligations in a timely manner 
failure to comply with the requirements of our senior debt exposes us to a variety of remedies available to our senior lenders  including acceleration of the debt  which would place a significant strain on our financial resources or foreclosure on our assets and the assets of optex 
our senior debt is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of optex 
as of september   we had term senior debt of approximately million outstanding 
as a result of the default under our prior senior bank debt and a resulting cross default with pequot  our subordinated convertible notes  initially in the aggregate amount of million that has been subsequently reduced to approximately million through conversions  also were refinanced when our senior lenders purchased such notes from pequot 
in addition  we entered into a short term promissory note  with a present principal value of million  with one of our senior lenders in july  which was subsequently extended to a maturity date of december through the issuance of million of additional debt to our senior lenders in november the consolidation of our senior and subordinated debt  july promissory note and our november promissory notes with common lenders increases the risks that all obligations could be accelerated concurrently  resulting in a demand that we could not satisfy 
our subordinated convertible notes  million and million promissory notes are also secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of optex 
we recently received notices from mr 
looney claiming that we are in default under our  one year unsecured subordinated promissory note with mr 
looney for the alleged nonpayment of principal and interest and that optex is in default under its million secured subordinated note with twl group  lp  an entity owned by mr 
looney  for the alleged nonpayment of principal and interest 
while we believe mr 
looney currently is prohibited under a subordination agreement from demanding payment or taking any other action under the  note due to the existence of a technical default under our senior debt  such circumstances could change  requiring us to pay the scheduled principal and interest that would otherwise be due under the  note 
in addition  twl group alleges that the maturity date of optex s million note was november  and that principal and interest was due on that date 
while we do not agree with twl group s allegations and believe that 
table of contents the maturity date of the million note currently is february   there can be no assurance that twl group s allegations will not be successful 
while we believe twl group currently would be prohibited under a subordination agreement from demanding payment or taking any other action under the million note due to the existence of a technical default under our senior debt  such circumstances could change  requiring optex to pay the scheduled principal and interest that would otherwise be due under the million note if mr 
looney s allegations were successful 
if circumstances change  requiring us and optex to repay the scheduled principal and interest under the  note and the million note  it would place a significant strain on our financial resources  may require us to raise additional funds and may make it difficult to obtain additional financing 
if we are unable at such time to repay the scheduled principal and interest under the notes  it could expose us to a variety of remedies available to our senior lenders  including acceleration of the senior debt or foreclosure on our assets and the assets of optex  and  subject to the subordination agreements  may expose us to any remedies that may be available to mr 
looney and twl group  including acceleration of their notes or twl group s foreclosure on the assets of optex 
our acquisition of optex is subject to significant operational and financial risks and challenges that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in december  we incurred a significant amount of debt in order to finance the initial acquisition of optex 
in december  this debt had to be refinanced to cure defaults thereunder 
because optex represents our first significant acquisition  we have no prior history of integrating acquired companies or businesses into our operations and we have not yet fully completed our integration of optex  we cannot fully predict the ultimate impact of the acquisition of optex on our business operations  financial condition and results of operations 
our acquisition of optex is subject to many inherent risks  including the history of optex as a privately held company and our ability to make the necessary investments to integrate the optex operations and maintain acceptable internal controls  our ability to successfully integrate the operational and cultural differences between our historical base of funded contract research and development  and optex s base of long term product manufacturing  our ability to satisfy the debt service and other requirements of our refinanced and new debt instruments  our ability to recruit a new management team for optex  our ability to successfully bridge the geographic separation between the optex operations in richardson  texas and our historical base of operations in costa mesa  california  the significant dilutive effect of the additional shares of our common stock issuable pursuant to the convertible debt and warrants issued in the financing of the acquisition of optex and the warrants issued in the refinancing of such debt  the customer and market concentration of optex s business  our ability to fulfill funded backlog at optex  our ability to achieve the expected synergies from the acquisition of optex  and general economic and political conditions that could affect optex s business 
certain optex products are dependent on specialized sources of supply that are potentially subject to disruption and attendant adverse impact to our business 
some of optex s products currently incorporate components purchased from single sources of supply 
the financial pressure surrounding the refinancing of our debt has limited our ability to supplement optex s working capital  which is principally used to purchase parts and materials from its suppliers 
if supply from single supply sources is materially disrupted  requiring optex to obtain and qualify alternate sources of supply for such components  our revenues could decline  our reputation with our customers could be harmed  and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our acquisition strategy may further strain our capital resources  result in additional integration and assimilation challenges  be further dilutive to existing stockholders  result in unanticipated accounting charges and expenses  or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations 
an element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses  assets or technologies that allow us to expand our capabilities and 
table of contents market coverage and to complement our existing product offerings 
optex was our first acquisition under this strategy 
acquisitions may require significant upfront capital as well as capital infusions  and typically entail many risks  including unanticipated costs and expenditures  changing relationships with customers  suppliers and strategic partners  or contractual  intellectual property or employment issues 
we have not engaged in an acquisition strategy prior to our acquisition of optex  we have experienced difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  personnel  technologies  products and information systems of optex and we may experience similar difficulties in assimilating any other companies or businesses we may acquire in the future 
in addition  key personnel of an acquired company may decide not to work for us 
the acquisition of another company or its products and technologies may also require us to enter into a geographic or business market in which we have little or no prior experience 
these challenges could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  harm our reputation and increase our expenses 
these challenges are magnified as the size of the acquisition increases 
acquisitions or asset purchases made entirely or partially for cash or debt could also put a significant strain on our limited capital resources 
acquisitions may also require large one time charges and can result in contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  deferred compensation charges  and the recording and later amortization of amounts related to deferred compensation and certain purchased intangible assets  any of which items could negatively impact our results of operations 
in addition  we may record goodwill in connection with an acquisition and incur goodwill impairment charges in the future 
any of these charges could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  we may issue equity or convertible debt securities in connection with an acquisition  as we did in connection with our initial acquisition of optex 
any issuance of equity or convertible debt securities may be dilutive to our existing stockholders and such securities could have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to locate or consummate any pending or future acquisitions  or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from these acquisitions  including our acquisition of optex 
even if we do find suitable acquisition opportunities  we may not be able to consummate the acquisition on commercially acceptable terms  and any decline in the price of our common stock may make it significantly more difficult and expensive to initiate or consummate an acquisition 
we have historically generated substantial losses  which  if continued  could make it difficult to fund our operations or successfully execute our business plan  and could adversely affect our stock price 
since our inception  we have generated net losses in most of our fiscal periods 
we experienced a net loss of approximately million for fiscal  including the effect of approximately million of debt extinguishment expenses resulting from the december refinancing of our debt and approximately million of imputed non cash interest expense resulting from debt discounts recorded in the fiscal year due to that refinancing and our july promissory note financing 
we experienced net losses of approximately million for fiscal  including the effect recorded in that fiscal year of our december debt refinancing  and million for fiscal we anticipate that we will incur approximately million of additional debt discount expenses in subsequent reporting periods while our refinanced debt is outstanding 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
in addition  because we have significant expenses that are fixed or difficult to change rapidly  we generally are unable to reduce expenses significantly in the short term to compensate for any unexpected delay or decrease in anticipated revenues 
for example  we experienced some significant contract delays in fiscal and fiscal that resulted in unanticipated additional operating expenses to keep personnel on staff while the contracts were pending with no corresponding revenues 
in addition  our present level of contract research and development revenue makes us dependent on support from subcontractors to meet our operating plans and susceptible to losses when such support is delayed 
such factors could cause us to continue to experience net losses in future periods  which will make it difficult to fund our operations and achieve our business plan  and could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our government funded research and development business depends on a limited number of customers  and if any of these customers terminate or reduce their contracts with us  or if we cannot obtain additional government contracts in the future  our revenues will decline and our results of operations will be adversely affected 
for fiscal  approximately of our total revenues were generated from research and development contracts with the defense advanced research projects agency  or darpa  approximately of our total revenues were generated from research and development contracts with the us air force and approximately of our total revenues were 
table of contents generated from research and development contracts with the us army 
for fiscal  approximately of our total revenues were generated from research and development contracts with the us air force  approximately of our total revenues were generated from research and development contracts with saic  a government contractor  and approximately of our total revenues were generated from research and development contracts with the us army 
although we ultimately plan to shift our focus to include the commercialization of our technology  we expect to continue to be dependent upon research and development contracts with federal agencies and their contractors for a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future 
our dependency on a few contract sources increases the risks of disruption in this area of our business or significant fluctuations in quarterly revenue  either of which could adversely affect our consolidated revenues and results of operations 
because both our historical operations and those of optex currently depend on government contracts and subcontracts  we face additional risks related to contracting with the federal government  including federal budget issues and fixed price contracts 
general political and economic conditions  which cannot be accurately predicted  directly and indirectly may affect the quantity and allocation of expenditures by federal agencies 
even the timing of incremental funding commitments to existing  but partially funded  contracts can be affected by these factors 
therefore  cutbacks or re allocations in the federal budget could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations as long as research and development contracts remain an important element of our business 
obtaining government contracts may also involve long purchase and payment cycles  competitive bidding  qualification requirements  delays or changes in funding  budgetary constraints  political agendas  extensive specification development and price negotiations and milestone requirements 
each government agency also maintains its own rules and regulations with which we must comply and which can vary significantly among agencies 
governmental agencies also often retain some portion of fees payable upon completion of a project and collection of these fees may be delayed for several months or even years  in some instances 
in addition  an increasing number of our government contracts are fixed price contracts  which may prevent us from recovering costs incurred in excess of its budgeted costs 
fixed price contracts require us to estimate the total project cost based on preliminary projections of the project s requirements 
the financial viability of any given project depends in large part on our ability to estimate such costs accurately and complete the project on a timely basis 
while we have historically not experienced material aggregate cost overruns on our fixed price contracts in our research and development business  we have recorded approximately million of provision for contract losses in fiscal for optex s production contracts  and our exposure to the risks of such overruns have increased in our products business due to the fact that optex s contracts are solely of a fixed price nature 
some of those contracts are for products that are new to optex and are thus subject to more potential for unanticipated impacts to manufacturing costs 
in the event our actual costs exceed the fixed contractual cost of either our research and development contracts or our product contracts  we will not be able to recover the excess costs 
some of our government contracts are also subject to termination or renegotiation at the convenience of the government  which could result in a large decline in revenue in any given quarter 
although government contracts have provisions providing for the reimbursement of costs associated with termination  the termination of a material contract at a time when our funded backlog does not permit redeployment of our staff could result in reductions of employees 
in  we experienced the termination of one of our contracts  but this termination did not result in the non recovery of costs or lay off of employees 
we have in the past chosen to incur excess overhead in order to retain trained employees during delays in contract funding 
we also have had to reduce our staff from time to time because of fluctuations in our funded government contract base 
in addition  the timing of payments from government contracts is also subject to significant fluctuation and potential delay  depending on the government agency involved 
any such delay could result in a temporary shortage in our working capital 
since a substantial majority of our total revenues in the last three fiscal years were derived directly or indirectly from government customers  these risks can significantly affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
these risks may become more pronounced as a result of our acquisition of optex  which also largely relies on government contracts 
if we are not able to commercialize our technology  we may not be able to increase our revenues or achieve or sustain profitability 
since commencing operations  we have developed technology  principally under government research contracts  for various defense based applications 
however  since our margins on government contracts are generally limited  and our revenues from such contracts are tied to government budget cycles and influenced by numerous political and economic factors beyond our control  and are subject to our ability to win 
table of contents additional contracts  our long term prospects of realizing significant returns from our technology or achieving and maintaining profitability will likely also require penetration of commercial markets 
in prior years  we have made significant investments to commercialize our technologies without significant success 
these efforts included the purchase and later shut down of a manufacturing line co located at an ibm facility  the formation of the novalog  msi  silicon film  redhawk and inetworks subsidiaries and the development of various stacked memory products intended for commercial markets in addition to military and aerospace applications 
while these investments developed new revenue sources  they have not resulted in consolidated profitability to date  and a majority of our total revenues for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were still generated from governmental customers 
in fiscal  we discontinued operations of our novalog subsidiary due to the decline in the sales of its products and lack of availability of economic sources of supply for its products 
the significant military operations in the middle east or elsewhere may require diversions of government research and development funding  thereby causing disruptions to our contracts or otherwise adversely impact our revenues 
in the near term  the funding of us military operations in iraq or elsewhere may cause disruptions in funding of government contracts 
since military operations of such magnitude are not routinely included in us defense budgets  supplemental legislative funding actions are required to finance such operations 
even when such legislation is enacted  it may not be adequate for ongoing operations  causing other defense funding sources to be temporarily or permanently diverted 
such diversion could produce interruptions in funding or delays in receipt of our research and development contracts  causing disruptions and adverse effects to our operations 
in addition  concerns about international conflicts and the effects of terrorist and other military activity have resulted in unsettled worldwide economic conditions 
these conditions make it difficult for our customers to accurately forecast and plan future business opportunities  in turn making it difficult for us to plan our current and future allocation of resources and increasing the risks that our results of operations could be adversely effected 
if we fail to scale our operations appropriately in response to recent growth  the acquisition of optex and changes in demand  we may be unable to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities  and our business could be materially and adversely affected 
we experienced a period of rapid growth in fiscal resulting in a increase in our total revenues to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal our total revenues in fiscal were million  higher than fiscal  largely due to the acquisition of optex 
our total revenues in the fiscal were million  approximately higher than fiscal  again largely due to the acquisition of optex 
our past growth has placed  and any future growth in our historical business is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our management personnel  infrastructure and resources 
these strains are likely to become more pronounced as a result of our acquisition of optex 
to implement our current business and product plans  we will need to continue to expand  train  manage and motivate our workforce  and expand our operational and financial systems  as well as our manufacturing and service capabilities 
all of these endeavors will require substantial management effort and additional capital 
if we are unable to effectively manage the integration of optex and our expanding operations  we may be unable to scale our business quickly enough to meet competitive challenges or exploit potential market opportunities  and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected 
historically  we have primarily depended on third party contract manufacturers for the manufacture of a majority of our products and any failure to secure and maintain sufficient manufacturing capacity or quality products could materially and adversely affect our business 
for our existing products  other than those manufactured by optex  we primarily use contract manufacturers to fabricate and assemble our stacked chip  microchip and sensor products  and our internal manufacturing capabilities prior to the acquisition of optex consisted primarily of assembly  calibration and test functions for our thermal camera products 
we currently plan to utilize optex for some of our future manufacturing needs  but we cannot guarantee our success in that endeavor 
we have typically used single contract manufacturing sources for our historical products and do not have long term  guaranteed contracts with such sources 
as a result  we face several significant risks  including a lack of guaranteed supply of products and higher prices  limited control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs  and the unavailability of  or potential delays in obtaining access to  key process technologies 

table of contents in addition  the manufacture of our products is a highly complex and technologically demanding process and we are dependent upon our contract manufacturers to minimize the likelihood of reduced manufacturing yields or quality issues 
we currently do not have any long term supply contracts with any of our manufacturers and do not have the capability or capacity to manufacture our products in house in large quantities 
if we are unable to secure sufficient capacity with our existing manufacturers  implement manufacturing of some of our new products at optex or scale our internal capabilities  our revenues  cost of revenues and results of operations would be negatively impacted 
optex faces additional risks related to contracting with the federal government  including federal budget issues and fixed price contracts 
optex s sales are largely to governmental agencies or prime contractors to such agencies 
general political and economic conditions  which cannot be accurately predicted  directly and indirectly may affect the quantity and allocation of expenditures by federal agencies 
even the timing of incremental funding commitments to existing  but partially funded  contracts can be affected by these factors 
therefore  cutbacks or re allocations in the federal budget could have a material adverse impact on optex s results of operations 
optex s ability to obtain contracts or purchase orders from government agencies or prime contractors frequently involves competitive bidding  qualification requirements  delays or changes in funding  budgetary constraints  political agendas  price negotiations and milestone requirements 
furthermore  virtually all of optex s products are delivered pursuant to fixed price orders  and optex must therefore bear the risks of cost growth associated with its products  except to the extent that it has negotiated cost inflation contract protection that adequately covers inflationary growth in its costs 
if we are not able to obtain market acceptance of our new products  our revenues and results of operations will be adversely affected 
we generally focus on markets that are emerging in nature 
market reaction to new products in these circumstances can be difficult to predict 
many of our planned products incorporate our chip stacking technologies that have not yet achieved broad market acceptance 
we cannot assure you that our present or future products will achieve market acceptance on a sustained basis 
in addition  due to our historical focus on research and development  we have a limited history of competing in the intensely competitive commercial electronics industry 
as such  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop  manufacture and market additional commercial product lines or that such product lines will be accepted in the commercial marketplace 
if we are not successful in commercializing our new products  our ability to generate revenues and our business  financial condition and results of operations will be adversely affected 
failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
our fiscal  fiscal and fiscal audits revealed material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting  including the failure of such controls to identify the need to record a post employment obligation for our escp  which resulted in a restatement of our financial statements 
we believe these types of material weaknesses relate primarily to the size and depth of our accounting staff 
we have attempted to address these material weaknesses by expanding our staff and reassigning responsibilities during fiscal and fiscal  but have not yet fully remediated this condition 
the acquisition of optex also created material weaknesses in our internal controls  both in terms of the infrastructure and control processes at optex and in our corporate controls for oversight and management of optex 
we have begun changing that infrastructure and internal control processes at optex to address those material weaknesses  but have also not yet fully remediated these conditions 
our size and limited discretionary capital leave us subject to other potential material weaknesses in the future 
we are in the process of documenting and testing our internal control processes in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act  which requires annual management assessments and a written report on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and  commencing in our fiscal  a report by our independent auditors on the effectiveness of our internal controls 
during the course of our testing  we may identify other significant deficiencies or material weaknesses  in addition to the ones previously identified  which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the sarbanes oxley act for compliance with the requirements of section in addition  if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  as such standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we will not be able to conclude that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock  and cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations in the future 

table of contents the acquisition of optex is expected to materially complicate the timely achievement of effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
the geographic separation of optex from our historical base of operations  and optex s prior organization as a family owned and operated  privately held company  has required the establishment of additional internal controls to meet the disclosure requirements of a publicly reporting company 
the transition to such controls as of september  has not yet been fully completed and tested and  as such  has been presently deemed to be a material weakness in our internal financial controls 
the implementation and testing of such additional internal controls will consume both time and financial resources  increasing our risks of timely compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
as a result of the acquisition of optex  achieving compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act will be substantially more complicated and costly  and we cannot assure you that such compliance will be achieved in a timely manner  or at all 
our stock price has been subject to significant volatility 
you may not be able to sell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
the trading price of our common stock has been subject to wide fluctuations in the past 
since january  our common stock has traded at prices as low as per share and as high as per share after giving effect to the for reverse stock split effected in september 
the current market price of our common stock may not increase in the future 
as such  you may not be able to resell your shares of common stock at or above the price you paid for them 
the market price of the common stock could continue to fluctuate or decline in the future in response to various factors  including  but not limited to quarterly variations in operating results  our ability to control costs and improve cash flow  our ability to introduce and commercialize new products and achieve broad market acceptance for our products  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  our ability to win additional research and development contracts  changes in investor perceptions  economic and political instability  including acts of war  terrorism and continuing international conflicts  and changes in earnings estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts 
the trading markets for the equity securities of high technology companies have continued to experience volatility 
such volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
we were subject to a class action lawsuit that diverted management s attention and resources from other matters until it was settled in june we cannot guarantee you that we will not be subject to similar class action lawsuits in the future 
if we are not able to adequately protect or enforce our patent or other intellectual property rights  our ability to compete in our target markets could be materially and adversely affected 
we believe that our success will depend  in part  on the strength of our existing patent protection and the additional patent protection that we may acquire in the future 
as of september   we held us patents and foreign patents and had other us patent applications pending as well as various foreign patent applications 
five of these patents  covering early versions of our stacking technology  expire in less than two years  which may narrow our ability to pose barriers to entry from competitors if these early technologies become commercially significant 
it is possible that any existing patents or future patents  if any  could be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and any right granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection from competition 
despite our precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products  services or technology without authorization  to develop similar technology independently or to design around our patents 
in addition  we treat technical data as confidential and generally rely on internal nondisclosure safeguards  including confidentiality agreements with employees  and on laws protecting trade secrets  to protect proprietary information 
we cannot assure you that these measures will adequately protect the confidentiality of our proprietary information or that others will not independently develop products or technology that are equivalent or superior to ours 

table of contents our ability to exploit our own technologies may be constrained by the rights of third parties who could prevent us from selling our products in certain markets or could require us to obtain costly licenses 
other companies may hold or obtain patents or inventions or may otherwise claim proprietary rights to technology useful or necessary to our business 
we cannot predict the extent to which we may be required to seek licenses under such proprietary rights of third parties and the cost or availability of these licenses 
while it may be necessary or desirable in the future to obtain licenses relating to one or more proposed products or relating to current or future technologies  we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
if our technology is found to infringe upon the rights of third parties  or if we are unable to gain sufficient rights to use key technologies  our ability to compete would be harmed and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
enforcing and protecting our patents and other proprietary information can be costly 
if we are not able to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary information or if we become subject to infringement claims by others  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
we may need to engage in future litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or the rights of our customers  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
we also may need to engage in litigation in the future to enforce our patent rights 
in addition  we may receive in the future communications from third parties asserting that our products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
we cannot assure you that any such claims would not result in protracted and costly litigation 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we will have the financial resources to vigorously defend or enforce our patents or other proprietary technology 
our proprietary information and other intellectual property rights are subject to government use which  in some instances  limits our ability to capitalize on them 
whatever degree of protection  if any  is afforded to us through our patents  proprietary information and other intellectual property generally will not extend to government markets that utilize certain segments of our technology 
the government has the right to royalty free use of technologies that we have developed under government contracts  including portions of our stacked circuitry technology 
while we are generally free to commercially exploit these government funded technologies  and we may assert our intellectual property rights to seek to block other non government users of the same  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our attempts to do so 
we are subject to significant competition that could harm our ability to win new business or attract strategic partnerships and could increase the price pressure on our products 
we face strong competition from a wide variety of competitors  including large  multinational semiconductor design firms and aerospace firms 
most of our competitors have considerably greater financial  marketing and technological resources than we or our subsidiaries do  which may make it difficult to win new contracts or to attract strategic partners 
this competition has resulted and may continue to result in declining average selling prices for our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with these companies 
certain of our competitors operate their own fabrication facilities and have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  sales and marketing  manufacturing  distribution  technical and other resources than us 
as a result  these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
they may also be able to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
increased competition has in the past resulted in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we believe that this trend may continue in the future 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to compete successfully or that competitive pressures will not materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must continually adapt to unforeseen technological advances  or we may not be able to successfully compete with our competitors 
we operate in industries characterized by rapid and continuing technological development and advancements 
accordingly  we anticipate that we will be required to devote substantial resources to improve already technologically complex products 
many companies in these industries devote considerably greater resources to research and development than we do 
developments by any of these companies could have a materially adverse effect on us if we are not able to keep up with the same developments 
our future success will depend on our ability to successfully adapt to any new technological advances in a timely manner  or at all 

table of contents we do not have long term employment agreements with our key personnel 
if we are not able to retain our key personnel or attract additional key personnel as required  we may not be able to implement our business plan and our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we depend to a large extent on the abilities and continued participation of our executive officers and other key employees 
the loss of any key employee could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we have adopted employee equity incentive plans designed to attract and retain key employees  our stock price has declined in recent periods  and we cannot guarantee that options or non vested stock granted under our plans will be effective in retaining key employees 
we do not presently maintain key man insurance on any key employees 
we believe that  as our activities increase and change in character  additional  experienced personnel will be required to implement our business plan 
competition for such personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that they will be available when required  or that we will have the ability to attract and retain them 
in addition  optex does not presently have depth of staffing in its executive  operational and financial management 
until additional key personnel can be successfully integrated with its operations  the timing or success of which we cannot currently predict  optex s results of operations and ultimate success will be vulnerable to difficulties in recruiting a new executive management team and losses of key personnel 
we may be subject to additional risks 
the risks and uncertainties described above are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business operations

in september  the court tentatively ruled in favor of the motions for summary judgment filed by us and inetworks requesting dismissal of the alter ego claims against us and the breach of contract claims against inetworks 
in order to avoid future legal risks and expenses  we entered into a settlement agreement with this consultant in october prior to the court s final ruling on the matter  and we issued to this consultant  shares of our common stock  valued at  with piggyback registration rights

overview we are a vision systems company enabled by proprietary technology for three dimensional packaging of electronics and manufacturing of electro optical products 
we design  develop  manufacture and sell vision systems and miniaturized electronic products for defense  security and commercial applications 
we also perform customer funded contract research and development related to these products  mostly for us government customers or prime contractors 
most of our historical business relates to application of our proprietary technologies for stacking either packaged or unpackaged semiconductors into more compact three dimensional forms  which we believe offer volume  power  weight and operational advantages over competing packaging approaches  and which we believe allows us to offer proprietary higher level products with unique operational features 
in december  we completed the initial acquisition the initial acquisition of of the outstanding capital stock of optex systems  inc  a privately held manufacturer of telescopes  periscopes  lenses and other optical systems and instruments whose customers are primarily agencies of and prime contractors to the us government 
in consideration for the initial acquisition  we made an initial cash payment to the sole shareholder of optex  timothy looney  in the amount of million and made an additional cash payment of  to mr 
looney in july upon completion of the audit of optex s financial statements for the year ended december  as additional consideration  we were initially required to pay to mr 
looney cash earnout payments in the aggregate amount up to million based upon the net cash generated from the optex business  after debt service  for the fiscal year ended october  fiscal  the fiscal year ended september  fiscal and the fiscal year ending september  fiscal 
mr 
looney was not entitled to any earnout payments for fiscal or fiscal in january  we negotiated an amendment to our earnout agreement with mr 
looney that extended his earnout period to december and reduced the aggregate maximum earnout by  to million in consideration for a secured subordinated term loan providing for advances from an entity owned by mr 
looney to optex of up to million  which term loan matures on the earlier 
table of contents of february or days after repayment of our debt to our senior lenders 
as of september   this term loan was fully advanced to optex 
in connection with the initial acquisition  we entered into an agreement with mr 
looney  pursuant to which we agreed to purchase the remaining of the capital stock of optex held by mr 
looney the buyer option  subject to stockholder approval  which approval was received in june on december   we amended certain of our agreements with mr 
looney regarding the buyer option 
in consideration for such amendments  we issued a one year unsecured subordinated promissory note to mr 
looney in the principal amount of  bearing interest at a rate of per annum 
we exercised the buyer option on december  and issued mr 
looney  shares of our common stock as consideration for our purchase of the remaining of the outstanding common stock of optex held by him 
as a result of the initial acquisition and exercise of the buyer option  optex is now our wholly owned subsidiary 
optex s products range from simple subassemblies to complex systems comprised of opto mechanical and electro optical products  which are typically built pursuant to customer supplied designs 
many of its products are sold pursuant to multi year  fixed price contracts  with pre negotiated cost inflation features  that are procured competitively by the military services or by prime contractors to the military services 
optex had product sales of approximately million and income before interest and provision for income taxes of approximately million in calendar year for the three quarters of fiscal subsequent to the initial acquisition  optex had approximately million in product sales 
in fiscal  optex had approximately million of product sales 
in recent years  optex s product sales from sales to prime contractors has increased 
optex s sales in fiscal reflect working capital limitations and related adverse supply chain effects  however  backlog at optex currently remains strong 
as of september   optex s funded backlog was approximately million  a substantial majority of which we expect to fulfill during fiscal we financed the initial acquisition of optex by a combination of million of senior secured debt from square bank under a term loan and million of senior subordinated secured convertible notes from two private equity funds  which are sometimes referred to in this report collectively as pequot 
in december  both of these obligations were refinanced with two new senior lenders 
these transactions resulted in approximately million of non recurring debt extinguishment expenses  which were largely non cash  and approximately million of future additional interest expense resulting from debt discounts and issuance costs 
in november  we restructured these obligations  as well as a short term million debt obligation  to extend the maturity date of such obligations to december  in consideration for a restructuring fee of approximately million  which is payable on december  except for fiscal years through when we generated significant commercial product sales of wireless infrared transceivers through a subsidiary  and prior to our initial acquisition of optex  we have historically derived a substantial majority of our total revenues from government funded research and development rather than from product sales 
optex has also historically derived most of its revenues from product sales to government agencies or prime contractors 
accordingly  we anticipate that a substantial majority of our total revenues will continue to be derived from government funded sources in the immediately foreseeable future 
prior to the fiscal year ended october  fiscal  with a few exceptions  our government funded research and development contracts were largely early stage in nature and relatively modest in size 
as a result  our revenues from this source were not significantly affected by changes in the us defense budget 
in fiscal  we received several contract awards that we believe may eventually have the potential to lead to government production contracts  which we believe could be both larger and more profitable than government funded research and development contracts 
these awards improved our contract research and development revenues to a substantial degree in fiscal our contract research and development revenues for fiscal and fiscal did not reach the levels achieved in fiscal primarily due to procurement delays in contracts 
however  the contribution to our contract research and development revenue from contract awards that we believe have the potential to lead to government production contracts continued at an increased level in fiscal and fiscal from that achieved in years prior to fiscal our current marketing efforts are focused on government programs that we believe have the potential to substantially sustain this focus on opportunities with the possibility of transition to government production contracts 
because of this focus and our acquisition of optex  our future revenues may become more dependent 
table of contents upon us defense budgets  funding approvals and political agendas for the foreseeable future 
we are also attempting to increase our revenues from product sales by introducing new products with commercial applications  in particular  miniaturized cameras and stacked computer memory chips 
we are currently transitioning to a new generation of such products  with a view to increasing our product sales  but we cannot assure you that we will be able to complete development  successfully launch or profitably manufacture and sell any such products on a timely basis  if at all 
we generally use contract manufacturers to produce these products  and all of our other current operations  except those of optex  occur at a single  leased facility in costa mesa  california 
optex manufactures its products at its leased facility in richardson  texas 
we have a history of unprofitable operations due in part to discretionary investments that we have made to commercialize our technologies and to maintain our technical staff and corporate infrastructure at levels that we believed were required for future growth 
these investments have yet to produce sustainable  profitable product sales 
with respect to our investments in staff and infrastructure  the advanced technical and multi disciplinary content of our proprietary technologies places a premium on a stable and well trained work force 
as a result  we generally maintain the size of our work force even when anticipated government contracts are delayed  a circumstance that has occurred with some frequency in the past and that has resulted in under utilization of our labor force for revenue generation from time to time 
delays in receipt of research and development contracts are unpredictable  but we believe such delays represent a recurring characteristic of our research and development contract business 
we anticipate that the impact on our business of future delays can be mitigated by the achievement of greater contract backlog and are seeking growth in our research and development contract revenue to that end 
we are also seeking to expand the contribution to our total revenues from product sales  which have not historically experienced the same types of delays that can occur in research and development contracts 
we have not yet demonstrated the level of sustained research and development contract revenue or product sales that we believe is required to predictably achieve profitable operations 
our ability to recover our investments through the cost reimbursement features of our government contracts is subject to both regulatory and competitive pricing considerations 
in the past  we have maintained separate operating business units  including our subsidiaries that were separately managed  with independent product development  marketing and distribution capabilities 
however  during the fiscal year ended september  fiscal  we reorganized our operations to consolidate our administrative  marketing and engineering resources and to reduce expenses 
in the fiscal year ended october  fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  none of our previous historical subsidiaries accounted for more than of our total revenues 
however  optex accounted for approximately of our total revenues in fiscal  even though it contributed to our total revenues for only three fiscal quarters 
in fiscal  optex accounted for approximately of our total revenues 
optex is expected to continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues in subsequent reporting periods 
none of our subsidiaries except optex accounted for more than of our total assets as of september  or have separate employees or facilities 
we currently report our operating results and financial condition in two operating segments  our research and development business and our product business 
optex accounted for approximately of our total product sales in fiscal in fiscal  we discontinued operations of our novalog subsidiary 
all financial statements and schedules of isc give effect to this discontinuation and report novalog as a discontinued operation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included at the end of this report 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
as such  management is required to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the significant accounting policies that are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating reported financial results include the following revenue recognition 
our consolidated total revenues during fiscal included a substantial contribution from contracts to develop prototypes and provide research  development  design  testing and evaluation of complex 
table of contents detection and control defense systems 
our research and development contracts are usually cost reimbursement plus a fixed fee or fixed price with billing entitlements based on the level of effort we expended 
for such research and development contracts  we recognize revenues as we incur costs and include applicable fees or profits primarily in the proportion that costs incurred bear to estimated final costs 
upon the initiation of each such contract  a detailed cost budget is established for direct labor  material  subcontract support and allowable indirect costs based on our proposal and the required scope of the contract as may have been modified by negotiation with the customer  usually a us government agency or prime contractor 
a program manager is assigned to secure the needed labor  material and subcontract in the program budget to achieve the stated goals of the contract and to manage the deployment of those resources against the program plan 
our accounting department collects the direct labor  material and subcontract charges for each contract on a weekly basis and provides such information to the respective program managers and senior management 
the program managers review and report the performance of their contracts against the respective program plans with our senior management on a monthly basis 
these reviews are summarized in the form of estimates of costs to complete the contracts etcs 
if an etc indicates a potential overrun against budgeted program resources  it is the responsibility of the program manager to revise the program plan in a manner consistent with the customer s objectives to eliminate such overrun and achieve planned contract profitability  and to seek necessary customer agreement to such revision 
to mitigate the financial risk of such re planning  we attempt to negotiate the deliverable requirements of our research and development contracts to allow as much flexibility as possible in technical outcomes 
given the inherent technical uncertainty involved in research and development contracts  in which new technology is being invented  explored or enhanced  such flexibility in terms is frequently achievable 
when re planning does not appear possible within program budgets  senior management makes a judgment as to whether the program statement of work will require additional resources to be expended to meet contractual obligations or whether it is in our interest to supplement the customer s budget with our own funds 
if either determination is made  we record an accrual for the anticipated contract overrun based on the most recent etc of the particular contract 
we provide for anticipated losses on contracts by recording a charge to earnings during the period in which a potential for loss is first identified 
we adjust the accrual for contract losses quarterly based on the review of outstanding contracts 
upon completion of a contract  we reduce any associated accrual of anticipated loss on such contract as the previously recorded obligations are satisfied 
costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings under government contracts are accounted for as unbilled revenues on uncompleted contracts and are stated at estimated realizable value 
we consider many factors when applying gaap related to revenue recognition 
these factors generally include  but are not limited to the actual contractual terms  such as payment terms  delivery dates  and pricing terms of the various product and service elements of a contract  time period over which services are to be performed  costs incurred to date  total estimated costs of the project  anticipated losses on contracts  and collectibility of the revenues 
we analyze each of the relevant factors to determine its impact  individually and collectively with other factors  on the revenue to be recognized for any particular contract with a customer 
management is required to make judgments regarding the significance of each factor in applying the revenue recognition standards  as well as whether or not each factor complies with such standards 
any misjudgment or error by management in its evaluation of the factors and the application of the standards could have a material adverse affect on our future operating results 

table of contents we recognize revenue from product sales  both from our operations in costa mesa  california and at optex  upon shipment  provided that the following conditions are met there are no unfulfilled contingencies associated with the sale  we have a sales contract or purchase order with the customer  and we are reasonably assured that the sales price can be collected 
the absence of any of these conditions  including the lack of shipment  would cause revenue recognition to be deferred 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
each quarter  we evaluate our inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
we write off inventories that are considered obsolete and adjust remaining inventory balances to approximate the lower of cost or market value 
the valuation of inventories at the lower of cost or market requires us to estimate the amounts of current inventories that will be sold 
these estimates are dependent on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers 
costs on long term contracts and programs in progress generally represent recoverable costs incurred 
the marketing of our research and development contracts involves the identification and pursuit of contracts under specific government budgets and programs 
we are frequently involved in the pursuit of a specific anticipated contract that is a follow on or related to an existing contract 
we often determine that it is probable that a subsequent award will be successfully received  particularly if continued progress can be demonstrated against anticipated technical goals of the projected new program while the government goes through its lengthy approval process required to allocate funds and award contracts 
when such a determination occurs  we capitalize material  labor and overhead costs that we expect to recover from a follow on or new contract 
due to the uncertainties associated with new or follow on research and development contracts  we maintain significant reserves for this inventory to avoid overstating its value 
we have adopted this practice because we believe that we are typically able to more fully recover such costs under the provisions of government contracts by direct billing of inventory rather than by seeking recovery of such costs through permitted indirect rates  which may be more vulnerable to competitive market pressures 
valuation allowances 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from a deterioration of a customer s ability to make required payments to the point where we believe it is likely there has been an impairment of its ability to make payments 
such allowances are established  maintained or modified at each reporting date based on the most current available information 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets 
we record the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations at their respective fair values at the date of acquisition  and any portion of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to acquired net tangible and intangible assets is recorded as goodwill 
valuation of intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  estimating future cash flows from product sales  developing appropriate discount rates  continuation of customer relationships and renewal of customer contracts  and approximating the useful lives of the intangible assets acquired 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
the provisions of sfas require us to test goodwill for impairment at least annually 
we have elected to evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to decreases in forecasted future profitability or cash flows or additional business risk arising from causes such as a a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  b unanticipated competition  or c an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
in performing the impairment review  we determine the carrying amount of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
see note to the condensed notes to consolidated financial statements 
a reporting unit is defined as an operating segment or one 
table of contents level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
a component of an operating segment is deemed a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component 
our optex subsidiary is a reporting unit within our product operating segment 
to evaluate whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit using the present value of their expected future cash flows 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
for our initial annual impairment review of optex  we placed reliance on our analysis conducted in our second fiscal quarter in connection with the initial acquisition 
we updated our impairment review of optex as of october  based on the analysis performed  we determined that the optex reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying amount at october   and therefore concluded that there was no indication of an impairment loss 
we performed a subsequent impairment review effective the fourth quarter of fiscal based on updated future cash flow projections that reflected both optex s increase in backlog and decrease in realized gross margins compared to our initial goodwill valuation  and based on this analysis  concluded that there was no indicated impairment loss at september  given that our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  we updated our impairment review of optex at the unit level prior to the filing of this annual report on form k 
we concluded from this update that the increase in optex s funded backlog had essentially compensated for lower realized revenues and gross margins in terms of expected future cash flows  such that no impairment loss was required to be recorded at september  however  if we are not able to satisfy our working capital needs for execution of optex s backlog  the valuation of goodwill related to optex could become impaired and our financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected 
accordingly  we expect to monitor these circumstances and update our impairment analysis of the optex goodwill as required by developments in fiscal  rather than just on an annual basis 
purchased intangible assets with determinable useful lives are carried at cost less accumulated amortization  and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
from time to time  but at least annually  we review the recoverability of the carrying value of identified intangibles and other long lived assets  including fixed assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is determined based upon the forecasted undiscounted future net cash flows that we expect to result from the use of such asset and its eventual disposition 
our estimate of future cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about our expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
the actual cash flows realized from these assets may vary significantly from our estimates due to increased competition  changes in technology  fluctuations in demand  consolidation of our customers and reductions in average selling prices  among other things 
if we determine that the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable from future operating cash flows  the asset is deemed impaired and we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair market value of the asset 
stock based compensation 
we calculate stock option based compensation by estimating the fair value of each option using the black scholes option pricing model in accordance with sfas r 
our determination of fair value of stock option based payment awards is made as of their respective dates of grant using the option pricing model and is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of other variables  including the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the portion of stock options granted that will ultimately vest  and the periods from the grant date until the options vest and expire 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of 
table of contents the fair value of our outstanding employee stock options 
we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the option after consideration of the estimated forfeiture rate 
we calculate compensation expense for both vested and nonvested stock awards by determining the fair value of each such grant as of their respective dates of grant using the closing sales price of our common stock on the nasdaq capital market at such dates without any discount 
we recognize compensation expense for nonvested stock awards on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
executive salary continuation plan liability 
we have estimated the escp liability based on the expected lifetime of participants using social security mortality tables and discount rates comparable to that of rates of return on high quality investments providing yields in amount and timing equivalent to expected benefit payments 
at the end of each fiscal year  we determine the assumed discount rate to be used to discount the escp liability 
we considered various sources in making this determination  including the citigroup pension liability index  which at september  was 
based on this review  we used a discount rate for determining escp liability at september  and as of october the date we recorded the initial adjustment to accumulated deficit resulting from the restatement 
see the explanatory note immediately preceding part i  item and note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for discussion of the restatement and its effects 
derivatives 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging instruments sfas requires us to record and carry all derivatives on the balance sheet as either liabilities or assets at fair value 
derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized through earnings as they occur 
comparison of fiscal years ended september  and october  results of operations total revenues 
our total revenues increased by nearly million in fiscal as compared to total revenues in fiscal  largely due to increased product sales 
part of the material increase in product sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the fact that optex contributed approximately million of product sales to total revenues in fiscal  but only contributed approximately million of product sales to total revenues in fiscal optex was consolidated in our financial statements only following our acquisition of a ownership interest  which occurred on december  and resulted in optex being consolidated in the second  third and fourth quarterly periods of fiscal contract research and development revenue 
contract research and development revenue consists of amounts realized or realizable from funded research and development contracts  largely from us government agencies and government contractors  primarily conducted by our historical operations in costa mesa  california 
contract research and development revenues for fiscal were modestly improved compared to fiscal as shown in the following table contract research and development percentage of revenue total revenue fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase for fiscal contract research and development revenue for fiscal improved only modestly in terms of absolute dollars from that realized in fiscal primarily because a number of procurements were initiated in fiscal somewhat later than expected primarily due to delays in the fiscal us defense budget 
the combination of modestly increased contract research and development revenue and materially increased product sales was the primary reason why contract research and development revenue as a percentage of total revenue declined in fiscal over the comparable percentage in fiscal absent the contribution of optex to our total revenues  contract research and development would have represented and  respectively  of our total revenues in fiscal and fiscal 
table of contents contract research and development revenue was recognized in the fiscal quarters of fiscal and fiscal as follows first weeks second weeks third weeks fourth weeks total fiscal fiscal the variances in contract research and development revenue both within the fiscal quarters of fiscal and fiscal and between the comparable fiscal quarters of each fiscal year were largely related to the specific programmatic milestones of the research and development contracts being performed in the respective periods  rather than any long term trend related to contractual bookings 
however  since research and development contracts are typically funded by government agencies on a fiscal year basis  both fiscal years reflected a relatively common annual pattern in which research and development contract revenue was less in the first half of each fiscal year than in the second half  as a result of the procurement processing time and associated delays at the start of each fiscal year to effectuate new contracts and funding increments 
cost of contract research and development revenue 
cost of contract research and development revenue consists of wages and related benefits  as well as subcontractor  independent consultant and vendor expenses directly incurred in support of research and development contracts  plus associated indirect expenses permitted to be charged pursuant to the relevant contracts 
our cost of contract research and development revenue for fiscal  in terms of absolute dollars  decreased modestly  compared to fiscal  resulting in an improvement in the realized gross margin percentage of our contract research and development revenue  as shown in the following table percentage of cost of contract contract research research and and development development revenue revenue fiscal dollar decrease in fiscal fiscal percentage decrease for fiscal a substantial portion of our contract research and development revenue is derived from cost reimbursable contracts  and we recognize revenue as we incur costs 
accordingly  under our research and development contracts  costs and revenues frequently tend to increase or decrease in a relatively related manner  absent significant cost overruns 
the decrease in absolute dollars of cost of contract research and development revenue and improvement in cost of contract research and development revenue as a percentage of cost of contract research and development revenue in fiscal reflected both unusually higher cost composition in fiscal and a different contract mix and performance in fiscal in fiscal  delays in receipt of new contracts caused us to increase our reserves against pre contract work in process inventory by  a factor that was not present in our fiscal costs of contract research and development revenue 
in addition  because of the uncertainty in timing of new contracts  adjustments in recovery of indirect costs through the billing rates of our cost reimbursable contracts produced less recovery of our allowable overhead expenses in fiscal than in fiscal we believe that these variances reflect the timing fluctuations that are generally inherent in our contract research and development business  rather than any fundamental trends 
however  in fiscal  we did realize increased gross margins on our research and development contracts that were not of a cost reimbursable nature over the comparable gross margins of such contracts in fiscal this fiscal outcome was partly the result of modestly better cost realization on fixed price contracts and partly the result of larger revenue contribution from time and material contracts that were not adversely impacted by indirect rate variances 
we will seek to sustain both these effects in future periods  but cannot guarantee that we will be successful in this endeavor 

table of contents cost of contract research and development revenue in the fiscal quarters of fiscal and fiscal is shown in the following table first weeks second weeks third weeks fourth weeks total fiscal fiscal as noted above  the contractual linkage between cost of contract research and development revenue and contract research and development revenue for cost reimbursable contracts results in period to period variances in the cost of contract research and development revenue that generally follow the variances in recognized contract research and development revenue 
that pattern was largely followed in the first three fiscal quarters of fiscal and in all quarters of fiscal  even after giving effect to the increase in reserves in the fiscal periods and the difference in recovery of indirect costs through rates noted above 
however  the modestly better cost realization on fixed price contracts and revenue contribution from time and material contracts discussed above had the greatest effect in the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal  resulting in that period having the lowest cost of contract research and development revenue as a percentage of contract research and development revenue of any of the fiscal and fiscal quarterly periods 
product sales 
subsequent to the initial acquisition of optex at the end of our first quarter of fiscal  our product sales have been principally comprised of sales of optex s optical equipment and systems  largely intended for use on military land vehicles 
we also derived some product sales from sales of chips  modules  stacked chip products and chip stacking services  and sales of miniaturized camera products 
product sales for fiscal and fiscal are shown in the following table percentage of product sales total revenue fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase for fiscal as discussed above  product sales in fiscal are not strictly comparable to product sales in fiscal  since optex product sales were not consolidated with ours in the first weeks of fiscal as a result  an increase of approximately million in optex s product sales for fiscal as compared to fiscal is largely due to the inclusion of four quarters of optex product sales in fiscal  but only three quarters of optex product sales in fiscal sales of products of our costa mesa operation in fiscal as compared to fiscal  increased by approximately million  reflecting increased sales of both thermal imaging and stacked chip products 
the combination of these factors resulted in the increase on both an absolute dollar basis and as a percent of total revenue for fiscal  as compared to fiscal based on our current backlog of orders and our belief that we can increase production levels  we anticipate that sales of optex s products will increase in absolute dollars in fiscal compared to fiscal  although our working capital limitations may affect our ability to realize the product sales potential in optex s funded backlog 
product sales in the fiscal quarters of fiscal and fiscal are shown in the following table first weeks second weeks third weeks fourth weeks total fiscal fiscal the variance in product sales between the first fiscal quarters of fiscal and fiscal is derived from the timing of the optex acquisition  as noted above 
optex product sales in the second fiscal quarter of fiscal were lower than the optex product sales in the second fiscal quarter of fiscal  largely due to working capital limitations 
this decrease was only partially offset by the increase in sales of products of our costa mesa operation discussed above in the second fiscal quarter of fiscal  resulting in product sales for that fiscal quarter being the lowest of the seven fiscal quarters in which we consolidated optex during fiscal and fiscal in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of fiscal  optex s product sales increased over the comparable periods of fiscal 
table of contents and the increase in sales of products of our costa mesa operation continued in those periods  as compared to such product sales in the second half of fiscal  resulting in product sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of fiscal being materially improved over the prior quarterly periods 
cost of product sales 
cost of product sales consists of wages and related benefits of our personnel  as well as subcontractor  independent consultant and vendor expenses directly incurred in the manufacture of products sold  plus related overhead expenses 
our cost of product sales for fiscal and fiscal is shown in the following table cost of product sales percentage of product sales fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase for fiscal the increase in absolute dollars of cost of product sales in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  partially reflected the corresponding increase in product sales discussed above 
however  approximately million of the increase in cost of product sales in fiscal was derived from accounting reserves established in the fiscal year in connection with the build up of inventory at optex and anticipated loss contracts associated with new optex products for which pricing estimates proved to be understated 
additionally  the fiscal increase in absolute dollars of cost of product sales was another reflection of the consolidation of optex only in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal  as opposed to the full four quarters of fiscal the increase in cost of product sales as a percent of product sales in the current fiscal year resulting from the accounting adjustments discussed above was partially offset by an increased contribution to product sales in fiscal from products from our costa mesa operations with higher gross margins 
furthermore  the absolute dollar increase in our cost of product sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal was partially offset by the fact that the costs of product sales in fiscal also included  of the purchase price allocation of the initial acquisition of optex to optex s finished goods inventory at the time of the initial acquisition  which was fully amortized into increased cost of product sales in fiscal and did not impact cost of product sales in fiscal cost of product sales in the fiscal quarters of fiscal and fiscal is shown in the following table first weeks second weeks third weeks fourth weeks total fiscal fiscal the variance in cost of product sales between the first fiscal quarters of fiscal and fiscal is also derived from the timing of the optex acquisition  as noted above 
the optex fiscal accounting reserves discussed above were largely recorded in the third and fourth fiscal quarters of fiscal  which is a major contributor to the large increases in cost of product sales and the primary contributor to the resulting negative gross margins for product sales in those two fiscal quarters 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense largely consists of wages and related benefits for our executive  financial  administrative and marketing team  as well as professional fees  primarily legal and accounting fees and costs  plus various fixed costs such as rent  utilities and telephone 
the comparison of general and administrative expense for fiscal and fiscal is shown in the following table general and administrative expense percentage of as restated total revenue fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase for fiscal 
table of contents see the explanatory note immediately preceding part i  item and note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
the largest contributor to the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the increase in general and administrative wages and related employee benefits  both due to additional headcount as a result of the consolidation of optex s general and administrative personnel in the current fiscal year as compared to the prior year in which these expenses were not consolidated for the first weeks of the fiscal year  and also due to increased labor expenses in the current year incurred to expand our finance staff 
the combination of these factors increased our general and administrative wages and related employee benefits by approximately million  or of the dollar increase in general and administrative expense  in fiscal  compared to fiscal the next largest contributor to the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was the increase in selling and marketing labor and expenses and bid and proposal expenses in the current year 
these factors accounted for an aggregate increase of  in fiscal  as measured against fiscal general and administrative service expense also increased in the current year  largely due to accounting and legal expenses related to the refinancing of our debt  by approximately  as compared to fiscal approximately  or of the dollar increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal was due to the consolidation of optex s fixed general and administrative expense  primarily related to optex s facility in richardson  texas for the full fiscal year  as opposed to only the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal similarly  general and administrative expense in the four quarters of fiscal also included approximately  of intangible asset amortization expense as a result of the optex acquisition  a factor that was only present in the second  third and fourth quarter of fiscal in absolute dollars  we expect that some of our general and administrative service expense of fiscal may prove to be nonrecurring  but other general and administrative expenses are likely to increase in future periods because of preparation for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and our acquisition of optex  both because of the effects of that acquisition on our corporate operations and increased expenses at optex related to the implementation of internal controls and disclosure requirements associated with being part of a publicly reporting company 
general and administrative expense  as restated  in the fiscal quarters of fiscal and fiscal is shown in the following table first weeks second weeks third weeks fourth weeks total fiscal fiscal the variance in general and administrative expense between the first fiscal quarters of fiscal and fiscal is also a reflection of the fact that optex was not consolidated with our results in the first quarter of fiscal  as discussed above 
the largest contributors to the subsequent increases in general and administrative expense thereafter were related to the consolidation of optex general and administrative expense  as discussed above 
the substantial increase in general and administrative expense in the second and third fiscal quarters of fiscal reflected a concentration of the increase in fiscal selling and marketing labor and expenses  bid and proposal expenses and service expense discussed above in those two quarters 
these were timing effects  rather than indications of trends 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists of wages and related benefits for our research and development team  independent contractor consulting fees and subcontractor and vendor expenses directly incurred in support of internally funded research and development projects  plus 
table of contents associated overhead expenses 
research and development expense for fiscal as compared to fiscal increased as shown in the following table research and percentage of development expense total revenue fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase for fiscal in our costa mesa operation  we use the same technical staff for both internally funded research and development expense  customer funded research and development contracts that produce revenue and bid and proposal activities that are a part of our general and administrative expense 
historically  fiscal involved an unusually low allocation of discretionary technical labor in costa mesa to internally funded research and development expense 
in fiscal  we placed a greater priority on the allocation of discretionary technical labor to research and development expense to try to support some of our new contract awards and strategic interactions  with a particular emphasis on building  testing and qualifying new forms of stacked chip products that we hope to be able to bring to market in fiscal this prioritization largely accounted for the substantial percentage increase in research and development expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal optex did not incur significant research and development expense in either fiscal or fiscal since its products are generally built to customer supplied designs 
research and development expense in the fiscal quarters of fiscal and fiscal is shown in the following table first weeks second weeks third weeks fourth weeks total fiscal fiscal as noted above  we allocated a greater amount of discretionary labor to internal funded research and development in fiscal than in fiscal the timing of that allocation between the fiscal quarters of fiscal reflected both the availability of technical labor and the schedule of the qualification activities necessary to address potential marketing of the planned new stacked chip products 
interest expense 
as anticipated  the amortization of debt discounts derived from our december debt refinancing substantially increased our interest expense for fiscal  compared to that of fiscal  as shown in the following table interest expense fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase in fiscal because of the imputed nature of the debt discount amortization  approximately million of the fiscal interest expense is of a non cash nature 
debt discount amortization will continue to contribute substantial amounts of imputed non cash interest expense in future periods until the debt is fully retired 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these effects 
interest expense in the fiscal quarters of fiscal and fiscal is shown in the following table first weeks second weeks third weeks fourth weeks total fiscal fiscal our interest expense increased substantially after the first fiscal quarter of fiscal as a result of the debt we incurred for the acquisition of optex 
the further increase in our interest expense in the fiscal quarters of fiscal 
table of contents was largely the result of the amortization of the non cash debt discounts derived from our december debt refinancing  as discussed above 
the amount of this amortization varied from quarter to quarter reflecting the conversion of debt in the various quarters  which conversion accelerated amortization of debt discounts related to the converted debt 
debt extinguishment expense 
in fiscal  we recorded a non recurring loss on extinguishment of debt of approximately million as a result of our refinancing of our senior and subordinated debt in december no comparable expense was recorded in fiscal see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this effect 
debt extinguishment expense in the fiscal quarters of fiscal and fiscal is shown in the following table first weeks second weeks third weeks fourth weeks total fiscal fiscal our debt extinguishment expense in the last two fiscal years was a non recurring  extraordinary expense that only affected the fist fiscal quarter of fiscal net loss 
our net loss for fiscal  compared to that of fiscal  increased as shown in the following table net loss fiscal as restated dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase in fiscal see the explanatory note immediately preceding part i  item and note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
our contract research and development revenue for both fiscal and was insufficient to fully support our technical staff and related infrastructure 
furthermore  our product sales in fiscal did not generate adequate margins to fully defray the remainder of our indirect expenses  and in fiscal  our product sales gross margins were negative 
however  the most significant contributor to the increase in net loss in fiscal was the interest expense increase and the debt extinguishment loss discussed above  which accounted for approximately million  or  of the increase in our net loss in fiscal the imputed expenses associated with the refinancing of our debt were substantial and are expected to continue to adversely impact our results in fiscal included in the fiscal loss was a non recurring settlement fee of million related to debt defaults  which decreases the net year to year dollar increase in fiscal net loss as compared to fiscal net loss 
our net loss  as restated  in the fiscal quarters of fiscal and fiscal is shown in the following table first weeks second weeks third weeks fourth weeks total fiscal fiscal comparison of fiscal years ended october  and october  total revenues 
the acquisition of optex in fiscal  the revenues of which consist solely of product sales  and the resulting inclusion of approximately million of product sales in fiscal was the primary cause for the fiscal increase in product sales revenues and the decrease in contract research and development revenue as a percent of total revenue in the current fiscal year 
the optex acquisition occurred at the end of the first fiscal quarter of so its operating results were only included in our fiscal consolidated financial statements for the second  third  and fourth quarters 

table of contents contract research and development revenue 
contract research and development revenues for fiscal decreased compared to fiscal  but continued to be the majority source of our total revenue as shown in the following table contract research and development percentage of revenue total revenue fiscal dollar decrease in fiscal fiscal percentage decrease for fiscal we believe that the dollar decrease in contract research and development revenue for fiscal was largely the result of delays in receipt of new contracts associated with the timing of the federal budget and related procurement activities 
contract research and development revenue is projected to represent a declining percentage of our future total revenues because of the acquisition of optex 
after eliminating the impact of optex on our total revenues  contract research and development would have represented of our total revenues in fiscal cost of contract research and development revenue 
our cost of contract research and development revenue for fiscal as compared to fiscal and its percentage of such revenue is shown in the following table percentage of contract research cost of contract research and and development development revenue revenue fiscal dollar decrease in fiscal fiscal percentage decrease for fiscal most of the dollar decrease in cost of contract research and development revenue in fiscal was derived from the fact that our revenues of this nature are generally recognized as we incur costs 
as a result  a decrease in contract research and development revenue has an associated decrease in cost of such revenue 
the increase in cost of contract research and development revenue as a percent of contract research and development revenue in fiscal was partially attributable to allocation of  of stock based compensation expense  related to stock options held by employees that charged direct labor to cost of contract research and development revenue in the current fiscal year  due to the new requirements established by sfas r  which first became effective for us at the beginning of fiscal in addition  the unusual delay in receipt of our expected new contracts caused us to increase our reserves against pre contract work in process inventory by  in fiscal  a factor that was not present in fiscal the contract delays also resulted in lower than projected total revenues for fiscal  which in turn produced higher effective overhead rates for the current fiscal year than originally projected due to the relatively fixed nature of our labor base 
our historical practice has been to adjust our indirect billing rates for cost reimbursable contracts only once or twice a year in order to provide a reasonably stable forecasting metric for both our customers and us 
in a period when our actual incurred overhead costs exceed those that we recover through our standard overhead billing rate  such as fiscal  the contribution of actual overhead expense disproportionately increases our cost of contract research and development revenue 
effective april  we adjusted our indirect billing rates for cost reimbursable contracts  and this adjustment had a beneficial effect to our recovery of costs in the balance of fiscal however  it did not fully recover all of our experienced overhead costs due to the prior conclusion or funding limits of some of our cost reimbursable contracts  which precluded additional cost recovery under such contracts 
in fiscal  increases to cost of contract research and development revenue resulting from indirect billing rates and stock based compensation expense were partially offset by a smaller percentage contribution to costs of contract research and development revenue from external vendors  independent contractors and subcontractors 
when the percentage contribution of external sources to our costs of contract research and development decreases and the percentage contribution of our internal labor to our costs of contract research and 
table of contents development correspondingly increases  our gross margin on our contract research and development revenue typically improves because of the greater cost reimbursement permitted for internal expenses under government cost reimbursement contracts than for external costs of vendors  independent contractors and subcontractors 
however  in fiscal  this improvement was not sufficient to offset the opposite effects of stock based compensation expense and higher overhead expense discussed above 
product sales 
as discussed above  subsequent to the initial acquisition of optex at the end of our first quarter of fiscal  our product sales were principally comprised of sales of optex s optical equipment and systems  largely intended for use on military land vehicles 
we also derived some product sales from sales of chips  modules  stacked chip products and chip stacking services and  to a limited degree  sales of miniaturized camera products 
product sales for fiscal and fiscal are shown in the following table percentage of product sales total revenue fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase for fiscal both the absolute dollar increase and percentage increase as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal were the direct result of the initial acquisition of optex on december   which contributed approximately million in product sales to fiscal the aggregate increase in our product sales resulting from the consolidation of nine months of optex s revenues more than offset an approximate million decline in sales of our stacked chip products and stacking services in fiscal as compared to fiscal we attribute some of the fiscal decline in sales of stacked chip products to our current emphasis on such products that include the value of the stacked memory chips themselves  as opposed to sales of stacking services  which involve the stacking of customer consigned memory chips  the value of which are not reflected in the resulting sales 
we believe that some of our customers in fiscal have elected to take the risk of purchasing memory chips for stacking and consigning them to our competitors for stacking in order to reduce costs  thus negatively impacting our sales 
furthermore  we believe that demand for stacked chips in tsops  which has been the industry standard for chip packages for over a decade  is mature  at best  and possibly is currently in decline 
in fiscal  we announced qualification of a process for converting tsops into stacks with bga attachments  which we believe can address emerging demand for stacked chip assemblies using more space efficient attachment technology 
the aggregate increase in product sales in fiscal resulting from the consolidation of nine months of optex s revenues also offset a decline in thermal viewer product sales in fiscal resulting from the procurement mechanisms used by customers 
in fiscal  approximately of our product sales were derived from a single initial product shipment of our first generation thermal viewer product 
this product was substantially improved later in fiscal  and we starting shipping limited quantities of our improved thermal viewer late in fiscal  continuing into fiscal however  in contrast to the sales in fiscal  sales of the second generation thermal viewer product have largely been procured through our research and development contracts as a convenience requested by the procuring agencies 
as a result  such sales are reflected in our contract research and development revenue in fiscal  rather than in product sales 
cost of product sales 
our cost of product sales for fiscal and fiscal is shown in the following table cost of percentage of product sales product sales fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase for fiscal 
table of contents the absolute dollar increase in our cost of product sales in fiscal was primarily due to the optex transaction discussed above  which resulted in the consolidation of both optex s product sales and its cost of such product sales 
the costs of product sales also included  of amortized intangible expenses derived from the purchase price allocation of the initial acquisition of optex 
in addition  we allocated  of the purchase price to optex s finished goods inventory at the time of the initial acquisition  which further increased cost of product sales in fiscal this latter allocation was fully charged to cost of product sales in fiscal and will not effect future fiscal periods 
these acquisition related expenses offset some improvements in cost of product sales of our stacked chip products in fiscal  resulting in an aggregate increase in the cost of product sales as a percent of total product sales from fiscal general and administrative expense 
the comparison of general and administrative expense for fiscal and fiscal is shown in the following table general and administrative expense percentage of as restated total revenue fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase for fiscal see the explanatory note immediately preceding part i  item and note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
the largest contribution to the dollar increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal was the increase in general and administrative service expenses  largely legal and accounting expenses  most of which were primarily related to the initial acquisition of optex  but also included increased consulting expenses payable to a director related to business development 
these factors accounted for approximately million  or  of the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal we anticipate that legal  accounting and consulting fees will continue to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal  both due to the activities related to the exercise of our optex buyer option  the negotiations regarding our debt refinancing and our preparation for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
increased general and administrative labor expense also accounted for approximately  or  of the increase in general and administrative expense for fiscal as compared to fiscal  largely due to the inclusion of optex s management labor expense  but also due to increased labor expenses incurred to enhance our financial staff  both in our corporate offices and at optex 
approximately  or  of the dollar increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of the shift in the deployment of certain of our technical staff to focus on our bid and proposal activities during the current year 
during fiscal  we had to adjust scheduled labor deployment to reflect the program scheduling impact of the delays in receipt of research and development contracts previously discussed 
because of identified material contract opportunities related to the fiscal defense budget  direct labor made available as a result of these delays was substantially deployed to bid and proposal activities in fiscal  rather than internal research and development expense  which has historically been the other typical deployment alternative for non revenue generating direct labor 
in fiscal  we did not deploy any resources to bid and proposal activities because of the notices of contract awards that we had already received relating to significant pending procurements 
in addition to the bid and proposal impact  general and administrative expense in fiscal was also increased by the requirement to expense stock based compensation costs associated with stock options pursuant to sfas r  a requirement that did not exist in fiscal this factor accounted for approximately  or  of the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal general and administrative expense in fiscal also included approximately  of intangible asset amortization expense as a result of the optex acquisition  a factor that was not present in fiscal and which contributed to approximately of the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal as compared to fiscal additionally  we increased our reserve for doubtful accounts receivable by  in fiscal  and no comparable expense was incurred in fiscal we believe this increase was related to isolated circumstances related to particular customers and contracts and do not believe this increase is indicative of a trend 

table of contents research and development expense 
research and development expense for fiscal as compared to fiscal changed as shown in the following table research and percentage of development expense total revenue fiscal dollar decrease in fiscal fiscal percentage decrease for fiscal the decrease in research and development expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal reflected our deployment of our technical staff in those respective years to alternative uses  namely for customer funded research and development contracts and also for bid and proposal activities 
we use the same technical staff for both internal and customer funded research and development projects  as well as bid and proposal activities  and when one of these categories is prioritized during a period  there is less labor available and correspondingly less expense for other categories 
delays in customer funded research and development contracts extended into the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  later than comparable delays in fiscal accordingly  more direct labor was available for non contract use in fiscal than fiscal however  of that available direct labor  as discussed above  a priority was given to bid and proposal activities for the deployment of discretionary resources in fiscal this resulted in less direct labor available for internally funded research and development projects in fiscal and a corresponding reduction in research and development expense 
since most of optex s sales relate to products built to customer supplied designs  optex generally has conducted very minimal internal research and development activities and accordingly  did not incur significant research and development expense in fiscal interest expense 
our interest expense for fiscal  compared to that of fiscal  increased substantially  largely as a result of the debt service associated with the initial acquisition of optex  as shown in the following table interest expense fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase in fiscal we anticipated that interest expense would increase substantially in future periods as a result of amortization of discounts derived from our debt refinancing in december  and such was the case as was discussed above 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these effects 
net loss 
our net loss for fiscal  compared to that of fiscal  increased as shown in the following table net loss as restated fiscal dollar increase in fiscal fiscal percentage increase in fiscal see the explanatory note immediately preceding part i  item and note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
our contract research and development revenue for both years was insufficient to fully support our technical staff and related infrastructure 
furthermore  our product sales in those periods did not generate adequate margins to fully defray the remainder of our indirect expenses 
the increase in net loss in fiscal was substantially derived from the recurring and non recurring costs and expenses related to the initial acquisition of optex  including 
table of contents approximately million of cash and imputed interest on the debt we incurred to consummate and manage that acquisition  as noted above 
we believe that the non recurring acquisition related expenses  such as the legal and accounting expenses associated with the various regulatory filings and the unusual expenses associated with the annual meeting of stockholders to approve certain aspects of the acquisition of optex and related transactions  were substantially diminished by the fourth quarter of fiscal however  we were required to record a million default settlement fee at october   which was paid to pequot in connection with the subsequent refinancing of our debt in december in addition  we incurred a  expense in fiscal expense as a result of the change in fair value of the derivative instrument resulting from our amendment of the securities purchase agreement with pequot in march  which agreement was originally entered into in connection with the initial acquisition of optex 
furthermore  the delay in start of several government research and development contracts in fiscal resulted in portions of those contracts being retained in backlog for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern due to our liquidity limitations 
over the course of fiscal  our consolidated cash and cash equivalents increased  but our liquidity as measured by our working capital declined as shown in the following table cash and cash working capital equivalents as restated october  dollar change in fiscal september  percentage change in fiscal see the explanatory note immediately preceding part i  item and note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
the increase in cash in fiscal was primarily due to approximately million of net cash provided by financing activities  including net proceeds of approximately million related to the refinancing of our senior and subordinated debt in december  a million subordinated note from an entity owned by timothy looney  a million promissory note from one of our senior lenders and approximately million from exercise of options and warrants  less  of debt issuance costs and principal payments on capital leases 
this increase in cash from financing activities was offset in part by the million settlement payment that was paid to pequot in december  approximately million of capital facilities and equipment expenditures and approximately million to fund the cash portion of our net loss in fiscal approximately million of our net loss was derived from non cash expenses  including approximately million of non cash interest expense  approximately million of non cash extinguishment of debt expense  approximately million of depreciation and amortization expense  of which was intangible amortization expense resulting from the acquisition of optex  approximately million of common stock contributions to employee retirement plans   non cash provision for allowance for inventory valuation and  of non cash stock based compensation 
the impact of various working capital element changes in the year and the million settlement payment to pequot  when combined with the effect of our net loss resulted in a net use of cash in operating activities of approximately million  approximately million of which was incurred in the first half of the fiscal year 
the most significant timing effect contributing to fiscal operating use of cash was a  increase in inventory  largely at optex  which built up substantial inventory during the first half of the fiscal year in response to its growing backlog  but started to reduce that build up in the second half of the fiscal year as a result of product shipments 
offsetting the cash impact of the inventory growth was an approximately million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  a  increase in accrued estimated loss on contracts  largely related to optex contracts for new products  a  decrease in unbilled revenues on contracts and a  decrease in accounts receivable 
management believes that these effects represent timing or isolated issues  rather than indications of trends 

table of contents we believe  but cannot guarantee  that our government funded research and development contract business will improve in fiscal  and will therefore generate increased liquidity through both improved gross operating margins and the recovery of indirect costs as permitted under our government contracts 
we also believe that our revenues from product sales will be greater in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  largely due to the size of our backlog for optex s products entering the new fiscal year 
at september   our funded backlog was approximately million  approximately million of which related to optex s business 
we expect  but cannot guarantee  that a substantial portion of our funded backlog at september  will result in revenue recognized in fiscal in addition  our government research and development contracts typically include unfunded backlog  which is funded when the previously funded amounts have been expended 
as of september   our total backlog  including unfunded portions  was approximately million 
contracts with government agencies may be suspended or terminated by the government at any time  subject to certain conditions 
similar termination provisions are typically included in agreements with prime contractors 
since our inception  we have experienced such termination of our contracts on three occasions  the latest of which was in april we cannot assure you that we will not experience suspensions or terminations in the future 
any such termination  if material  could cause a disruption of our revenue stream  adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations and could result in employee layoffs 
we currently believe that our working capital and liquidity at september   reflecting the restructuring of our debt in november and in concert with anticipated proceeds from financing activities  should be adequate to support our existing operations for our foreseeable plans for at least the next twelve months 
however  ramping up the optex supply chain to fulfill its funded backlog may require additional working capital and there may be product sales growth opportunities in this interval that could place demands on our working capital that would require substantial additional external infusion of working capital through equity or debt financings 
we cannot guarantee that financings would be available on a timely basis  or on acceptable terms  or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements consist primarily of conventional operating leases 
as of october  and september   we did not have any other relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partners  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
contractual obligations and commitments debt 
at september   we had approximately million of debt  exclusive of debt discounts  which consisted of i subordinated convertible notes collectively  the notes initially issued in two series to pequot in the original aggregate principal amount of million and subsequently purchased by our new senior lenders in december and reduced to an aggregate principal amount of approximately million through partial conversion of such debt into common stock  ii the principal balance outstanding of our million term note with our new senior lenders  iii a million secured subordinated term loan from an entity owned by timothy looney to our optex subsidiary  described more fully below  iv a one year  subordinated promissory note to timothy looney  described more fully below  and v a million secured promissory note from one of our new senior lenders  described more fully below 
the term note bears interest at per annum 
initially  quarterly interest  but no principal  was payable on the term note during its term until its original maturity date of december  however  pursuant to our november debt restructuring see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  the maturity date of the term note was extended to december  and all interest due was also deferred until december  the term note is subject to acceleration at the option of the senior lenders upon the occurrence of certain events of default 
our senior lenders have waived our requirement to comply with financial debt service covenants 
table of contents for the term of the term note  provided that we remain in compliance with certain other requirements of the term note 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to avoid default conditions under the term note in the future 
the notes initially bore interest at the rate of per annum  and the principal and interest under the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price per share that was initially set at  which conversion price is subject to adjustment under certain conditions 
due to the issuance of warrants to our new senior lenders in connection with the refinancing of our senior debt in december  the conversion price per share of the notes was automatically adjusted to in accordance with the existing anti dilution provisions in the notes 
we issued the first series of notes the series notes in the original principal amount of approximately million 
initially  the series notes were repayable in quarterly interest only payments commencing march  through december  thereafter  the series notes were payable in equal monthly principal installments plus interest maturing on december  as a result of our november restructuring of our debt see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  both the principal and accrued interest under the series notes became payable on december  and the stated interest rate increased to per annum  compounding monthly 
the second series of notes the series notes are in the original principal amount of approximately million and interest on such notes was initially repayable in quarterly interest only payments commencing march   with the remaining principal amount initially due and payable on december  upon assignment of the notes to our new senior lenders in december  the maturity date of the series notes was extended to december  as a result of our november restructuring of our debt see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  the principal and accrued interest under the series notes also became payable on december  we may be required to repurchase the notes under certain circumstances  including upon election of the note holders following an event of default as defined in the notes  upon the incurrence of debt other than permitted indebtedness under the notes  and upon certain issuances of our capital stock  at a repurchase price equal to the greater of the outstanding principal amount of the notes purchased  plus all accrued but unpaid interest thereon through the day of payment  and of the average of the closing prices of our common stock for the five days preceding the repurchase date 
in september  pequot notified us that events of default had occurred under the notes as a result of our non compliance with the covenant of our senior bank debt  as well as other facts and circumstances that we disputed  and invoked its repurchase right under the notes 
however  shortly after issuance of pequot s notice  our then senior lender issued a payment blockage notice to pequot regarding the note repurchase that suspended the effectiveness of the pequot event notice 
in december  the notes were assigned through purchase from pequot to our new senior lenders and any existing or asserted defaults thereunder were waived by our new senior lenders 
as a result of the restructuring of the notes and term notes in november  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements  the effective interest rate of these debt instruments  in the aggregate  has been reduced from to 
in connection with the original december financing  we also issued warrants to pequot the pequot warrants in two series to purchase shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  which pequot warrants expire on december  the series warrants were initially exercisable for the purchase of up to  shares of our common stock  and the series warrants were initially exercisable for the purchase of up to  shares of our common stock 
due to the issuance of warrants to our new senior lenders  in december  pursuant to the anti dilution provisions contained in such warrants  the series warrants were automatically adjusted to become exercisable for the purchase of up to  shares at per share  and the series warrants were automatically adjusted to become exercisable for the purchase of up to  shares at per share 
subsequent to this adjustment  upon the exercise of any warrants after the issuance of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock as adjusted for any stock splits  stock combinations or similar events  we may either i deliver the applicable shares of common stock  or ii pay to pequot an amount equal to the black scholes value of the pequot warrants with respect to the portion exercised in excess of  shares subject to adjustments mentioned above 
the portion of the warrants with respect to which the cash amount has been paid will be cancelled and retired 
as a result of stockholder approval  both the series warrants and series warrants are currently fully exercisable  subject to a blocker that would prevent pequot s stock ownership at any given time from exceeding of our outstanding common stock 

table of contents see notes   and to the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the optex initial acquisition and the related financings and debt 
on december   we amended certain of the agreements with timothy looney regarding our buyer option to purchase the remaining interest in optex 
in consideration for such amendments  we issued a one year unsecured subordinated promissory note to mr 
looney in the principal amount of  bearing interest at a rate of per annum 
in january  we negotiated an amendment to our earnout agreement with mr 
looney that extended his earnout period to december and reduced the aggregate maximum earnout to million in consideration for a subordinated secured term loan from an entity owned by mr 
looney providing for advances up to million  bearing interest per annum  provided to optex  which term loan matures on the earlier of february or sixty days after retirement of our senior debt 
at september   there was million of debt outstanding under this subordinated secured term loan 
we recently received notices from mr 
looney claiming that we are in default under our  one year unsecured subordinated promissory note with mr 
looney for the alleged nonpayment of principal and interest and that optex is in default under its million secured subordinated note with twl group  lp  an entity owned by mr 
looney  for the alleged nonpayment of principal and interest 
while we believe mr 
looney currently is prohibited under a subordination agreement from demanding payment or taking any other action under the  note due to the existence of a technical default under our senior debt  such circumstances could change  requiring us to pay the scheduled principal and interest that would otherwise be due under the  note 
in addition  twl group alleges that the maturity date of optex s million note was november  and that principal and interest was due on that date 
while we do not agree with twl group s allegations and believe that the maturity date of the million note currently is february   there can be no assurance that twl group s allegations will not be successful 
while we believe twl group currently would be prohibited under a subordination agreement from demanding payment or taking any other action under the million note due to the existence of a technical default under our senior debt  such circumstances could change  requiring optex to pay the scheduled principal and interest that would otherwise be due under the million note if twl group s allegations were successful 
if circumstances change  requiring us and optex to repay the scheduled principal and interest under the  note and the million note  it would place a significant strain on our financial resources  may require us to raise additional funds and may make it difficult to obtain additional financing 
if we are unable at such time to repay the scheduled principal and interest under the notes  it could expose us to a variety of remedies available to our senior lenders  including acceleration of the senior debt or foreclosure on our assets and the assets of optex  and  subject to the subordination agreements  may expose us to any remedies that may be available to mr 
looney and twl group  including acceleration of their notes or twl group s foreclosure on the assets of optex 
on july   we entered into a loan agreement  a secured promissory note the promissory note and an omnibus security interest acknowledgement with longview fund  lp  one of our existing senior lenders that is an accredited institutional investor the lender  pursuant to which we closed a short term non convertible loan in the present principal amount of million the loan  the proceeds of which were intended principally for general working capital purposes 
the promissory note bears interest at a rate of per annum  due together with the unpaid principal amount when the promissory note matures  which was originally on january   but was extended to december  pursuant to our november debt restructuring see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
if we fail to pay the principal and accrued interest within ten days after the maturity date  we will incur a late fee equal to of such amounts 
we did not exercise a right to prepay all of the outstanding principal under the promissory note on or prior to august  by paying to the lender an amount equal to of the principal amount of the promissory note  together with accrued but unpaid interest 
as a result  the principal amount of the promissory note was automatically increased by  to million and we issued the lender  shares of the company s common stock  in lieu of a  cash continuation fee for continuing the term of the promissory note beyond august   and a five year class b common stock purchase warrant to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the exercise price  but not the number of shares issuable  under the class b warrant is subject to adjustment in the event of certain dilutive issuances and we will grant the lender  at the lender s election  registration rights  if any  granted in connection 
table of contents with such other dilutive issuance 
the class b warrant also contains a blocker that would prevent the lender s stock ownership at any given time from exceeding of our outstanding common stock which percentage may increase but never above 
deferred interest 
pursuant to our november debt restructuring see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  all accrued interest on the term note  the notes and the promissory note at september  was deferred to a due date of december  capital lease obligations 
our outstanding principal balance on our capital lease obligations of  at september  relate primarily to manufacturing and test equipment at our costa mesa  california operations and are included as part of current and non current liabilities within our consolidated balance sheet 
operating lease obligations 
we have various operating leases covering equipment and facilities located in costa mesa  california and richardson  texas 
deferred compensation 
the company has a deferred compensation plan  the executive salary continuation plan escp  for select key employees of the company 
benefits payable under the escp are established on the basis of years of service with the company  age at retirement and base salary  subject to a maximum benefits limitation of  per year for any individual 
the escp is an unfunded plan 
the recorded liability for future expense under the escp is determined based on expected lifetime of participants using social security mortality tables and discount rates comparable to that of rates of return on high quality investments providing yields in amount and timing equivalent to expected benefit payments 
at the end of each fiscal year  the company determines the assumed discount rate to be used to discount escp liability 
the company considered various sources in making this determination for fiscal  including the citigroup pension liability index  which at september  was 
based on this review  the company used a discount rate for determining the escp liability at september  there are presently two retired executives of the company who are receiving benefits aggregating  per annum under the escp 
two current executives of the company are eligible for benefits aggregating  per annum upon their retirement 
as of september    has been accrued in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for the escp  of which amount  is a current liability expected to be paid during fiscal the company s financial statements for periods prior to fiscal have been restated to reflect escp liability 
see note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  in notes to consolidated financial statements 
other commitments 
pursuant to a consulting agreement  at september  we were obligated to pay a success fee of  to a consulting company  of which one of our directors is the sole owner  in connection with the initial acquisition of optex  which fee is a portion of the total purchase price for the optex acquisition

table of contents we believe  but cannot guarantee  that our government funded research and development contract business will improve in fiscal  and will therefore generate increased liquidity through both improved gross operating margins and the recovery of indirect costs as permitted under our government contracts 
this belief stems from our visibility into budgetary decisions of various government agencies and our present backlog 
we also believe that our revenues from product sales will be greater in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  largely due to the size of our backlog for optex s products entering the new fiscal year 
we further believe that these increased product sales are likely to contribute positively to our cash provided by operations 
at september   our funded backlog was approximately million  approximately million of which related to optex s business 
we expect that a substantial portion of our funded backlog at september  will result in revenue recognized in fiscal in addition  our government research and development contracts typically include unfunded backlog  which is funded when the previously funded amounts have been expended 
as of september   our total backlog  including unfunded portions  was approximately million

similar termination provisions are typically included in agreements with prime contractors 
since our inception  we have experienced such termination of our contracts on three occasions  the latest of which was in april we cannot assure you that we will not experience suspensions or terminations in the future 
any such termination  if material  could cause a disruption of our revenue stream  adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations and could result in employee layoffs 
we currently believe that our working capital and liquidity at september   reflecting the restructuring of our debt in november and in concert with anticipated proceeds from modest financing activities  will be adequate to support our existing operations for our foreseeable plans for at least the next twelve months 
however  ramping up the optex supply chain to fulfill its funded backlog may require additional working capital and there may be product sales growth opportunities in this interval that could place demands on our working capital that would require substantial additional external infusion of working capital through equity or debt financings 
we cannot guarantee that either modest or substantial financings would be available on a timely basis  or on acceptable terms  or at all 
stock based compensation as discussed in note to our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report  effective october   we adopted sfas r  which resulted in our recognition of stock option based compensation for fiscal and fiscal as an element of our aggregate stock based compensation 
our aggregate stock based compensation for fiscal and fiscal was attributable to the following fiscal fiscal cost of contract research and development revenue general and administrative expense prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for our stock option plans in accordance with accounting principle board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
as such  compensation expense was recorded at the date of grant only if the quoted closing sales price of the underlying stock on that date exceeded the exercise price of the options 
however  we have historically provided pro forma net earnings and pro forma net earnings per share disclosures as if the fair value of all stock options as of their respective grant dates were recognized as expense over the service periods of those options in accordance with sfas we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  compensation costs recognized in fiscal and fiscal includes i compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet earned as of october   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and ii compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to october  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective method  results for the corresponding periods of fiscal have not 
table of contents been restated  and we will continue to disclose the pro forma effect of option grants on net earnings and net earnings per share in our financial statement footnote disclosures 
we also will continue to account for equity instruments issued to persons other than our employees and directors non employees in accordance with the provisions of sfas and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services 
all transactions in which goods or services are the consideration received for equity instruments issued to non employees are accounted for based on the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instrument issued  whichever is more reliably measurable 
the measurement date used to determine the fair value of any such equity instrument is the earliest to occur of i the date on which the third party performance is complete  ii the date on which it is probable that performance will occur  or iii if different  the date on which the compensation has been earned by the non employee 
during fiscal  we issued  shares of our common stock  valued at  to non employees to pay legal expenses incurred in connection with our december debt refinancing  and a warrant to purchase  unregistered shares of our common stock  valued at  to a non employee as partial consideration for investor relations services 
we have historically issued stock options to employees and outside directors whose only condition for vesting were continued employment or service during the related vesting period 
typically  the vesting period has been up to four years for employee awards and immediate vesting for director awards  although awards have sometimes been granted with two year vesting periods 
we have recently begun issuing nonvested stock grants to new employees and outside directors 
the typical restriction period for such grants is three years 
we may impose other performance criteria for the vesting of options or nonvested stock granted in the future 
for purposes of sfas r  we calculate stock option based compensation by estimating the fair value of each option granted using the black scholes option valuation model and various assumptions that are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
once the compensation cost of an option is determined  we recognize that cost on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the option  which is typically the vesting period for options granted by us 
we calculate compensation expense of both vested and nonvested stock grants by determining the fair value of each such grant as of their respective dates of grant using our stock price at such dates with no discount 
we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of a nonvested stock award 
for fiscal  stock based compensation included compensation costs attributable to such period for those options that were not fully vested upon adoption of sfas r  compensation costs for options and non vested stock grants that were awarded during the period  prorated from the date of award to september   adjusted for estimated forfeitures in accordance with sfas r and compensation costs for vested stock grants made during the respective periods 
an option to purchase  shares of our common stock was granted to an officer during fiscal during fiscal  there were awards of  shares of nonvested stock  net of  shares forfeited  granted to employees and directors 
during fiscal  there were awards of  shares of vested stock granted to employees and directors 
the method we employ to calculate stock based compensation is consistent with the method used to compute stock based compensation under sfas  except that under sfas r  we are required to estimate expected forfeitures  rather than adjusting for forfeitures when they occur as required under sfas we have estimated forfeitures to be  which reduced stock based compensation cost by  in fiscal at september   the total compensation costs related to nonvested option awards not yet recognized was  the weighted average remaining vesting period of nonvested options at september  was years
