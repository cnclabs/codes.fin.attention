the million credit facility bears interest at variable rates  therefore  the amount of interest payable under the million credit facility is influenced by changes in short term interest rates  which tend to be sensitive to inflation 
to the extent an increase in inflation would result in increased operating costs  such as in insurance  real estate taxes and utilities  substantially all of the tenants leases require the tenants to absorb these costs as part of their rental obligations 
in addition  inflation also may have the effect of increasing market rental rates 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s risk management includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
the carrying value of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued interest  dividends and distributions payable and other liabilities are reasonable estimates of fair value because of the short term nature of these instruments 
the fair value of the company s long term debt  which is based on estimates by management and on rates quoted on december  for comparable loans  is less than the aggregate carrying value by approximately million at december  the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk related to its million credit facility and certain other indebtedness as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the interest on the million credit facility and certain other indebtedness is subject to fluctuations in the market 
the company also uses long term and medium term debt as a source of capital 
these debt instruments are typically issued at fixed interest rates 
when these debt instruments mature  the company typically refinances such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
in addition  the company may attempt to reduce interest rate risk associated with a forecasted issuance of new debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with these transactions  the company occasionally enters into interest rate protection agreements 
if the interest rates for variable rate debt were basis points higher or lower during  the company s interest expense would have increased or decreased by million 
if the interest rate for the fixed rate debt maturing in was basis points higher or lower than its current rate of  the company s interest expense would have increased or decreased by  the sensitivity analysis above assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
it also does not consider future fluctuations in interest rates or the specific actions that might be taken by management to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations 
the company is also exposed to currency risk on its net investment in the united kingdom 
the company does not believe that this currency risk exposure is material to its financial statements
