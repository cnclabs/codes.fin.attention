overview we are a pharmaceutical company engaged in the development of medications for the treatment of severe psychiatric and metabolic diseases 
since our inception in may  we have been developing our lead product  corlux  a glucocorticoid receptor ii  or gr ii  antagonist 
psychotic depression our lead program is for the development of corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic major depression  under an exclusive patent license from stanford university 
psychotic major depression  or pmd  will hereinafter be referred to as psychotic depression 
the united states food and drug administration  or fda  has granted fast track status to evaluate the safety and efficacy of corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
between august and march we announced the top line results of our initial three phase trials in which corlux was evaluated for treating the psychotic features of psychotic depression 

table of contents we reported the initial results of study  the last of the three phase trials  in march these results indicated that this study did not achieve statistical significance with respect to the primary endpoint  improvement in the brief psychiatric rating scale positive symptom subscale  or bprs pss  at day and at day however  there was a statistically significant correlation between plasma levels and clinical outcome achieved during treatment 
patients whose plasma levels rose above a predetermined threshold statistically separated from both those patients whose plasma levels were below the threshold and those patients who received placebo 
in particular  those patients in study who achieved a predetermined level of nanograms of corlux per milliliter of plasma separated from the placebo group with statistical significance for the primary endpoint 
conversely  at substantially lower plasma levels  there was no distinguishable response rate between patients who received corlux and those receiving placebo 
this study confirms a similar finding in study that at higher plasma levels the drug candidate is able to demonstrate desired clinical effects 
further  the incidence of serious adverse events did not differ between placebo and any of the three corlux dose groups 
data aggregated from our major efficacy studies of similar design  study  study  study and study  observed cases indicate that the patients who received corlux separated from the placebo group with statistical significance for the endpoint  improvement in the bprs pss at day and at day in addition  using the same endpoint  patients who achieved a drug level in their plasma that was greater than the nanograms per milliliter threshold mentioned above  statistically separated from both those patients whose plasma levels were below this threshold and those patients who received placebo 
we believe that the confirmation of a correlation between drug concentration and clinical response  as well as other observations from study and our other two completed phase clinical trials  serves as a strong basis for our current phase study  which commenced enrollment in march of the protocol for this trial incorporates what we have learned from the three completed trials addressing the established relationship between increased drug plasma levels and clinical response and attempt to decrease the random variability observed in the results of the psychometric instruments used to measure efficacy 
in this trial we are using a dose level of mg once per day for seven days because  as expected  at successively higher dosages  more patients achieved the predetermined plasma concentration that correlates with response 
in study  of the patients who took mg of corlux achieved a drug plasma level sufficient for a strong clinical response 
we have seen no difference in the safety data between any of the dose levels used in study in our initial review of a summary of that data 
we believe that this change in dose  as well as other modifications to the protocol  should allow us to demonstrate the efficacy of corlux in the treatment of the psychotic symptoms of psychotic depression 
management of weight gain induced by antipsychotics during we announced the top line results of our proof of concept study evaluating the ability of corlux to mitigate weight gain associated with the use of olanzapine 
this study in healthy male volunteers was initiated during the first quarter of the top line results indicated a statistically significant reduction in weight gain in those subjects who took olanzapine plus corlux compared to those who took olanzapine alone 
eli lilly and company  or lilly  provided olanzapine and financial support for this study 
the combination of olanzapine and corlux is not approved for any indication 
the purpose of this study was to explore the hypothesis that gr ii antagonists would mitigate weight gain associated with atypical antipsychotic medications 
the group of medications known as atypical antipsychotics  including olanzapine  risperidone  clozapine and quetiapine  are widely used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder 
all medications in this group are associated with treatment emergent weight gain of varying degrees and carry a warning label relating to treatment emergent hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus 
in april  we announced results from two preclinical studies conducted in a rat model of olanzapine induced weight gain 
these studies demonstrated that corlux reduced both the weight gain associated with ongoing olanzapine use and prevented the weight gain associated with the initiation of treatment with olanzapine 

table of contents cushing s syndrome in july  we received orphan drug designation from the fda for corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome 
cushing s syndrome is a disorder caused by prolonged exposure of the body s tissues to high levels of the hormone cortisol 
sometimes called hypercortisolism  it is relatively rare and most commonly affects adults aged to an estimated to of every one million people are affected each year 
orphan drug designation is a special status granted by the fda to encourage the development of treatments for diseases or conditions that affect fewer than  patients in the united states 
drugs that receive orphan drug designation obtain seven years of marketing exclusivity from the date of drug approval as well as tax credits for clinical trial costs  marketing application filing fee waivers and assistance from the fda in the drug development process 
the investigational new drug application ind for the evaluation of corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome was opened in september the fda has indicated that a single study may provide a reasonable basis for the submission of a new drug application nda for this indication 
this trial is now open for enrollment 
research and human biology in july  we executed an agreement with xceleron limited to conduct a human microdosing study of one of corcept s new chemical entities  a selective gr ii antagonist  utilizing xceleron s accelerator mass spectrometry  or ams  technology 
in early  we initiated a discovery research program to identify and patent selective gr ii antagonists to develop a pipeline of products for proprietary use 
three distinct series of gr ii antagonists were identified 
these compounds appear to be as potent as our lead product corlux in blocking cortisol but  unlike corlux  they do not appear to block the progesterone or other steroid receptors 
we are evaluating one of the compounds  which develops particularly high plasma and brain concentrations in an animal model  in a human microdosing study using xceleron s ams technology 
during and early we signed agreements with our contract research scientists to continue our discovery research activities on new compounds for through june general our activities to date have included product development  designing  funding and overseeing clinical trials  regulatory affairs  and intellectual property prosecution and expansion 
historically  we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of our preferred stock and the public sale of common stock rather than through collaborative or partnership agreements 
therefore  we have no research funding or collaborative payments payable to us  except for the revenue under the agreement with lilly discussed above 
we are in the development stage and have incurred significant losses since our inception 
we have not generated any revenue through december other than the revenue under the collaboration agreement with lilly  and do not expect to generate significant revenue for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities  including clinical trial activities for corlux  discovery research  
table of contents non clinical activities such as toxicology and carcinogenicity studies  manufacturing process development and regulatory activities  as well as general and administrative expenses 
we expect to continue to incur net losses over at least the next several years as we continue our corlux clinical development program  apply for regulatory approvals  initiate development of newly identified gr ii antagonists for various indications  continue our discovery research program  acquire and develop treatments in other therapeutic areas  establish sales and marketing capabilities and expand our operations 
our business is subject to significant risks  including the risks inherent in our research and development efforts  the results of our corlux clinical trials  uncertainties associated with securing financing  uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patents  our investment in manufacturing set up  the lengthy and expensive regulatory approval process and competition from other products 
our ability to successfully generate revenues in the foreseeable future is dependent upon our ability  alone or with others  to finance our operations and develop  obtain regulatory approval for  manufacture and market our lead product 
in april  nasdaq granted our request to transfer the listing of our common stock from the nasdaq global market to the nasdaq capital market 
since transferring to the nasdaq capital market  we have been in compliance with all listing requirements 
results of operations collaboration revenue collaboration revenue relates to services rendered in connection with our agreement with lilly discussed above under the caption overview management of weight gain induced by antipsychotics 
under the agreement  lilly agreed to supply olanzapine and pay for the costs of the study 
we were required to perform development activities as specified in this agreement and we were reimbursed based on the costs associated with the conduct of the trial and the preparation and packaging of clinical trial materials 
revenue was recognized as the services were rendered in accordance with the agreement 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized approximately  and  respectively  under this agreement 
there will be no significant revenue under this agreement in the future as the majority of the activities were completed during research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include the personnel costs related to our development activities  including non cash stock based compensation  as well as the costs of discovery research  pre clinical studies  clinical trial preparations  enrolment and monitoring expenses  regulatory costs and the costs of manufacturing development 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease in expenses reflects clinical trial cost decreases of approximately million due to the substantial completion of our earlier phase clinical trials for psychotic depression in late and early  which were partially offset by approximately  in costs associated with the preparations for our upcoming psychotic depression trial and increases in clinical trial costs related to other programs of approximately  during the year ended december  as compared to  there were also increases in contract research expenses of approximately  due to basic research work in new chemical compounds and the initiation of the micro dosing study on a selected compound  increases in analytical testing of approximately  and increases in manufacturing expenses of approximately  due to the manufacture of additional materials for upcoming clinical trials and manufacturing process development 
in addition  during the year ended december  as compared to  there were decreases in pre clinical studies of approximately  and staffing expenses of approximately  which included decreases in non cash stock based compensation of approximately  the decreases in staffing expenses were offset by increases in consulting and professional fees of  for as compared to 
table of contents research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase in expenses between years reflect clinical trial cost increases of approximately million for as compared to primarily related to clinical trial expenses for our first three phase psychotic depression studies 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in of approximately  in expenses for our discovery research program due to the successful conclusion of a program focusing on the discovery of new chemical entities that will be available for future development 
during as compared to  the costs of our clinical program also reflected a decrease of approximately  from the conclusion of our study in mild to moderate alzheimer s disease in and an increase of approximately  related to the commencement of the olanzapine induced weight gain mitigation clinical trial in collaboration with lilly 
in addition  during  as compared to there were decreases in pre clinical studies and manufacturing development of approximately  and  respectively  decreases in travel  consulting and other expenses of  and increases in staffing expenses of approximately  the increases in staffing expenses were primarily due to higher non cash stock based compensation expense 
research and development expenses discussed above included stock based compensation charges related to option grants to individuals performing these functions of approximately   and  respectively  for the years ended december   and the increase in expense between and was due principally to the implementation of sfas r in january the decrease between and was due principally to the cancellation of unvested options due to the resignation of an employee early in  which was partially offset by increases in expense related to options granted during in addition  during the years ended december   and upon the termination of employees or the change in status of employees who worked in a development function to consultants  we recorded reversals of approximately   and  respectively  of previously reported stock based compensation expense  which represents the difference between the expense recorded and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the rights to options that vested during the service of these individuals as employees 
see the discussion below under the caption stock based compensation for options to employees impact of adopting sfas r regarding the impact of adoption in january below is a summary of our research and development expenses by major project year ended december  project in thousands corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression corlux for other clinical programs drug discovery research stock based compensation total research and development expense we expect that research and development expenditures will increase during as compared to due to the commencement of our phase studies in cushing s syndrome and psychotic depression  the clinical trials to further evaluate the management of weight gain induced by antipsychotic medications  and to continue development of our proprietary selective gr ii antagonists 
research and development expenses in and future years will be largely dependent on the availability of additional funds to finance clinical development plans based on our experience from prior trials 
see also  the liquidity and capital resources section in this form k 

table of contents many factors can affect the cost and timing of our trials including inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials  slow patient enrollment  adverse side effects in study patients  insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of the drug in our trials 
in addition  the development of all of our product candidates will be subject to extensive governmental regulation 
these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our product candidates 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the costs of administrative personnel and related facility costs along with legal  accounting and other professional fees 
general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease in costs between years was comprised of decreases in legal and professional fees of approximately  due primarily to lower costs related to patents 
staffing costs also decreased by approximately  in as compared to the changes in staffing costs included a decrease in non cash stock based compensation of approximately  which was offset by increases in salaries and wages of  the decreases in stock based compensation expense during included a reversal of approximately  of stock compensation expense during the second quarter of in connection with the resignation of an officer  which represents the excess of expense under the graded vesting method as compared with the expense associated with stock options that actually vested prior to this termination 
there were net increases of approximately  between and in stock based compensation charges related to stock options granted to officers and employees during  which were partially offset by declining expense of earlier options due to the decelerating scale of expense under the graded vesting method and options cancelled due to the termination 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in as compared to was primarily due to increases in professional fees of approximately  and increases in staffing costs of approximately  the increases in staffing expenses were primarily due to higher non cash stock based compensation expense 
general and administrative expenses included stock based compensation expense related to option grants to individuals performing these functions of approximately million  million and  respectively  for the years ended december   and see discussion below under the caption stock based compensation for options to employees impact of adopting sfas r regarding the impact of adoption in january the amount of general and administrative expenses in and future years will be largely dependent on our assessment of the staff necessary to support our continued clinical development activities and the availability of additional funds 
see also  the liquidity and capital resources section in this form k 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net of investment management fees  was approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the same period in and million in the decreases in each successive period were principally attributable to decreased interest on investments due to lower average balance of invested funds that were partially offset by higher yields on the investment portfolios 
other expense 
other expense was approximately  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the same period in and  in other expense includes interest expense on capitalized leases entered into during the second quarter of and state tax on capital which is based on our capital and asset positions as of each year end 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have incurred operating losses since inception  and at december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
since our inception  we have relied primarily on the proceeds from public and private sales of our equity securities to fund our operations 
on march   we sold million shares of common stock at a price of per share in a private placement  which generated net proceeds of approximately million after deducting issuance costs 
during the third quarter of  we sold approximately million shares of common stock at a price of per share in a private placement  which generated net proceeds of approximately million after deducting issuance costs 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments balances of million  compared to million at december  net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december   and  were million  million and million  respectively 
the use of cash in each period was primarily a result of net losses associated with our research and development activities and amounts incurred to develop our administrative infrastructure 
we expect cash used in operating activities to increase during and later years due to the continuation and expansion of our development programs for psychotic depression  cushing s syndrome and the management of weight gain induced by atypical antipsychotic medications  research activities  commercialization activities and general and administrative expenses 
on march   we sold approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share and warrants to purchase approximately million shares of its common stock  at a price of per warrant in a private placement 
the warrants have a seven year term and an exercise price of per share 
the march financing generated approximately million in net proceeds  after deducting the costs of issuance 
on march   we entered into a committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge capital limited kingsbridge  a private investment group 
under the terms of the agreement  kingsbridge has committed to provide up to million of capital in exchange for newly issued shares of corcept s common stock for a period of up to three years after the securities and exchange commission declares effective the registration statement to be filed by corcept covering the resale of the shares of common stock issuable in connection with the ceff and the shares of common stock underlying the warrant discussed below 
the maximum number of shares that can be sold by corcept under this agreement is approximately million shares 
under the terms of the agreement  the determination of the exact timing and amount of any ceff financings will be made solely by corcept  subject to certain conditions 
based on the closing stock price of the company s common stock on march   the maximum amount of net proceeds that could be raised under the ceff is approximately million 
the actual amount of net proceeds that can be raised under this agreement will be dependent on the number of shares actually sold under the agreement and the market value of corcept s stock during the pricing periods of each sale 
we believe that  with the completion of these march financing transactions  we will have sufficient capital resources to complete the final reporting for our recently completed psychotic depression trials  to conduct clinical trials in cushing s syndrome  psychotic depression  and the management of weight gain induced by antipsychotic medications  and to continue development work on our proprietary  selective gr ii antagonists 
our projections include an estimate of proceeds from a variable funding source based on the calculations as of march  discussed in the preceding paragraph 
see part i  item a  risk factors for a discussion of risks related to the committed equity financing facility 
we will have to perform additional clinical trials prior to submission of an nda for corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression and for cushing s syndrome 
we will need to raise additional funds to complete the development of corlux for the treatment of psychotic depression  to initiate its clinical development for other indications  to prepare for its commercialization and to conduct other research activities 

table of contents we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we obtain funds through collaborations with others  these arrangements may be on unfavorable terms or may require us to relinquish certain rights to our technologies or product candidates  including potentially our lead product candidate  that we would otherwise seek to develop on our own 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or we may be required to discontinue operations 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table presents our estimates of obligations under contractual agreements as of december  payments due by period less than year years years more than years in thousands research and development studies through purchase commitments operating lease capital leases minimum royalty payments per year total  per year amounts reflected for research and development studies exclude amounts included in accounts payable and accrued clinical costs reflected on the balance sheet as of december  during through  we executed a number of agreements to conduct clinical trials and pre clinical studies for further development of our lead product  corlux  targeted for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
the agreements provide for termination by us upon forty five days written notice or less 
the exact amounts and timing of these obligations are dependent on the pace of activities of the various trials and studies 
as of december   substantially all patient activities had been completed and remaining reporting activities are expected to be completed in early  at a cost of approximately  during  the company signed agreements for services in connection with the trial to be initiated for corlux for the treatment of cushing s syndrome 
the total commitment under agreements signed during is approximately million 
approximately  was expensed under these agreements during  with the remainder to be expensed over the remainder of the trial 
under the master agreement with these vendors  the agreements may be terminated upon sixty days notice to the vendors 
if terminated early  the company would be responsible for the costs incurred by the vendor through the effective date of the termination plus cancellation charges as stipulated in the various agreements 
during and early  the company signed agreements for research services on new compounds 
the total commitment under these research agreements is approximately million of which  was expensed in  the remainder will be incurred in during  we initiated an agreement for a human microdosing study of one of the company s new chemical entities 
the total commitment under this agreement is approximately  approximately  of this commitment was expensed during the remainder will be incurred in in november  the company signed a letter of intent loi with a contract research organization to assist in preparations for the upcoming phase clinical trial in psychotic depression 
the total commitment under this loi was approximately  approximately  of this commitment was expensed in  with the remainder to be paid in in november  we initiated purchase orders for the acquisition of active pharmaceutical ingredient to be delivered in our operating lease commitment relates to the lease of our office facility 
the operating lease  originally signed in was effective for a month term  from july through december at a monthly rental of approximately  plus operating expenses 
in july  we extended the lease through december at a monthly rental of approximately  plus operating expenses 
during  we entered into capital leases for the acquisition of certain pieces of office furniture and equipment 
under our cancelable license agreement with stanford university  we are obligated to make nonrefundable minimum royalty payments of  annually for as long as we maintain our licenses with stanford  however  these payments are creditable against future royalties 
we also have other contractual payment obligations  the timing of which is contingent on future events 
a under our license agreement with stanford university related to the patent covering the use of gr ii antagonists to treat the psychosis associated with psychotic depression and early dementia  we are obligated to make milestone payments to stanford of  upon filing of an nda covering the licensed product and  upon fda approval of the licensed product 
the milestone payments payable to stanford under these licenses are creditable against future royalties 

table of contents b under the agreement with our contract research company we may be obligated to make milestone payments upon the occurrence of certain events  including i patent filings in connection with the project  ii entries into phase clinical trials  and iii national regulatory approval of each product arising from work performed under the agreement  provided that sales of the product by the company or any future licensees reach  these obligations remain in force after the conclusion of work under the agreement 
there are no royalty obligations associated with this contract 
c our agreement with scinopharm taiwan that provides for the manufacture and supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for corlux includes a minimum purchase commitment of  per year following the commercial launch of corlux 
this agreement may be terminated by us at any time without penalty 
d on november   we signed an agreement with produits chimiques auxiliaires et de synthese sa pcas for the manufacture of mifepristone  the active pharmaceutical ingredient in corlux  for our development and commercial needs for an initial period of five years 
the agreement provides for an automatic extension for one additional year unless either party gives twelve month s prior notice that it does not want the extension 
there is no guaranteed minimum purchase commitment under this agreement 
if pcas is unable to manufacture the product for a consecutive six month period  we have the right to terminate the agreement without penalty 
in march  we signed an agreement with medavante  inc  to provide centralized psychiatric rating services of patients to be screened and enrolled in our fourth phase clinical trial evaluating corlux for the treatment of the psychotic features of psychotic depression 
the total commitment under this agreement is approximately million 
approximately million of this cost will be incurred during  with the remainder occurring over the course of the trial 
this agreement may be terminated by corcept with days notice to medavante 
net operating loss carryforwards at december  we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and approximately  in federal research and development tax credit carryforwards  as well as approximately million of california net operating loss carryforwards and approximately  in california research and development tax credit carryforwards  available to offset any future taxable income we may generate 
the federal and california net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire beginning in and  respectively 
our deferred tax assets have been offset by a full valuation allowance as the realization of such assets is uncertain 
the internal revenue code of  as amended  places certain limitations on the annual amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that can be utilized in any particular year if certain changes in our ownership occur 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition collaboration revenue 
collaboration revenue relates to services rendered in connection with our agreement signed in october with lilly under which lilly agreed to supply olanzapine and pay for the study 
we were required to perform development activities as specified in this agreement and were reimbursed based on the costs associated with the conduct of the trial and the preparation and packaging of clinical trial materials 
revenue was recognized as services were rendered in accordance with the agreement 
the cost of providing these research services approximates the revenue recognized 
accruals of research and development costs 
we recorded accruals for estimated costs of research  pre clinical and clinical studies  and manufacturing development of approximately  and million as of december  and  respectively 
these costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses 
we make significant judgments and estimates in determining the accrual balance in each reporting period 
accrued clinical trial costs are based on estimates of the work completed under the service 
table of contents agreements  milestones achieved  patient enrollment and past experience with similar contracts and service providers 
our estimate of the work completed and associated costs to be accrued includes our assessment of the information received from our third party contract research organizations and the overall status of our clinical trial activities 
in the past  we have not experienced any material deviations between accrued clinical trial expenses and actual clinical trial expenses 
however  actual services performed  number of patients enrolled and the rate of patient enrollment may vary from our estimates  resulting in adjustments to clinical trial expense in future periods 
stock based compensation for options 
stock based compensation arises from the granting of stock options to employees and directors  as well as to non employees 
employees and directors we adopted statement of financial accounting standard revised  share based payment  or sfas r  as of january  under the modified prospective method  in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement r for all share based payment arrangements with employees granted or modified after the effective date and b based on the requirements of statement for all awards granted to employees and directors prior to the effective date of statement r that remain non vested on the effective date 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we had accounted for stock based compensation for options granted to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and had adopted the disclosure only alternative of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  or sfas because we had used the minimum value method for sfas pro forma disclosure requirements for options granted prior to the ipo in  we continue to account for the portion of these pre ipo grants that were non vested as of january  under the provisions of apb and related interpretations  with pro forma disclosures under sfas under apb  we recorded deferred stock based compensation related to option grants to employees and directors that represents the difference  if any  between the exercise price of an option and the fair value of our common stock on the date of the grant 
given the absence of an active market for our common stock prior to the time of our ipo in april  management was required to estimate the fair value of our common stock based on a variety of company and industry specific factors for the purpose of measuring the cost of the transaction and properly reflecting it in our financial statements 
since our ipo  all stock options have been granted at exercise prices that represent the closing price for the stock on the nasdaq stock market as of the date of grant 
deferred compensation is included as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized to expense over the vesting period of the underlying options  generally five years 
our policy has been to use the graded vesting method for recognizing compensation costs for fixed employee awards for all awards granted through december  we amortize the deferred stock based compensation of employee options using the graded vesting attribution method over the vesting periods of the applicable stock options 
the graded vesting method provides for vesting of portions of the overall awards at interim dates and results in greater expense in earlier years than the straight line method 
upon termination of employment  the difference between the expense recorded under the graded vesting method and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the vesting of the related option is required to be reversed 
following is a brief synopsis of the implications of adoption of this statement on our accounting practices and the estimates and judgments that are considered in determining fair value in regard to stock option grants to employees and directors the grant date fair value for all new grants issued after january  is being amortized to expense using the straight line method over the vesting period of the options 
the expected term used in determining the fair value for options is based on the simple method prescribed by the securities and exchange commission  or sec  in staff accounting bulletins and 
table of contents  and considers the weighted average of the vesting period and contractual life of the options 
there has been no adjustment made to the expected term to adjust for employees expected exercise and expected post vesting termination behavior because we have a limited employee base and do not have sufficient historical information to determine such an adjustment 
the expected volatility of our common stock used in determining the fair value of option grants is based on a weighted average combination of the volatility of our own stock price and that of a group of peer companies since we do not have sufficient historical data from which to base an appropriate volatility assumption 
since we have a limited employee base  at this time we do not have sufficient historical information to determine a reasonable forfeiture rate for options that might not vest because of employee terminations 
when an employee terminates  we will record a change in accounting estimate that represents the difference between the expense recorded under the straight line method and the expense that would have been recorded based upon the rights to options that vested during the individual s service as an employee 
the following table indicates the impact on our statement of operations for the year ended december   as a result of implementing sfas r 
year ended december  operating expense category research and development general and administrative total amounts in thousands expense under provisions of apb incremental expense expense under provisions of sfasr as of december   the company had the following amounts of unrecognized compensation expense for employee options outstanding as of that date 
amount weighted average period in thousands in years remaining deferred compensation related to options granted prior to the ipo  to be expensed under the provisions of apb remaining fair value to be expensed options granted after ipo through  using fair value under sfas options granted after january   using fair value under sfas r total non employees stock based compensation related to option grants to non employees is charged to expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options  based on the fair value of the options  which approximates the period over which the related services are rendered  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the assumptions used in these calculations are similar to those used for the determination of fair value under sfas and r for options granted to employees  with the exception that  for non employee options  we are required to use the remaining contractual term as the life of the option and the fair value related to unvested non employee options is re measured quarterly  based on the then current stock price as reflected on the nasdaq stock market 

table of contents income taxes 
the company accounts for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse
