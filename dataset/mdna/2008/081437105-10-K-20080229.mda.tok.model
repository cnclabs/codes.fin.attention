item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis three years ended december  management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in item of this annual report on form k 
three year review of results dollars in millions net sales cost of products sold gross margin selling  general  and administrative expenses all other expenses income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income effective income tax rate overview bemis company  inc is a leading global manufacturer of flexible packaging and pressure sensitive materials supplying a variety of markets 
generally about percent of our total company net sales are to customers in the food industry 
sales of our flexible packaging products are widely diversified among food categories and can be found in nearly every aisle of the grocery store 
other markets into which we sell our flexible packaging products include medical devices  personal care  and lawn and garden 
our emphasis on supplying packaging to the food industry has historically provided a more stable market environment for our flexible packaging business segment  which accounts for about percent of our net sales 
the remaining percent of our net sales is from the pressure sensitive materials business segment which  while diversified in end use products  is less focused on food industry applications and more exposed to economically sensitive end markets 
market conditions the markets into which our products are sold are highly competitive 
our leading flexible packaging market positions in north and south america reflect our focus on expanding our offering of value added  proprietary products 
we also manufacture products that are less unique but for which our technical know how and economies of scale offer us a competitive advantage 
the primary raw materials for our business segments are polymer resins  films  paper  and adhesives  the cost of which has increased in recent years with higher petrochemical prices 
in this environment  cost management has become a critical element of our competitive position 
during  consumer budgets were strained by higher energy costs  higher food prices  and in some cases  increased housing related costs associated with mortgage market issues 
these pressures appear to have negatively impacted consumer demand in food and consumer product markets resulting in reduced customer orders for related packaging 
restructuring and related charges in january  we announced the planned closure of five flexible packaging facilities and one pressure sensitive materials facility in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency 
these efforts were substantially complete as of december  total remaining costs incurred in were substantially offset by restructuring related gains 
restructuring and related charges incurred in totaled million  of which million primarily reflected accelerated depreciation and was recorded as a component of cost of products sold 
the remaining million primarily reflected employee related costs and was recorded as a component of other costs income 
acquisitions in january  we acquired majority ownership of dixie toga sa  one of the largest packaging companies in south america 
the acquisition included the outstanding voting common stock of dixie toga in addition to percent of the outstanding nonvoting preferred stock 
the initial cash purchase price  paid in  was approximately million increased by million in related to post close adjustments 
subsequently  our south american subsidiary has repurchased additional shares of its outstanding preferred stock in the open market  reducing the total minority interest in our subsidiary to percent as of december  in april  we also acquired the remaining shares of our three majority owned joint ventures in mexico for million 
results of operations consolidated overview in millions  except per share amounts net sales net income diluted earnings per share versus for the year ended december   net sales increased percent  reflecting a net sales benefit from currency translation of percent  offset by a percent decrease in net sales related to lower unit sales volume 
diluted earnings per share were for  including a per share tax benefit related to dividends from foreign subsidiaries 
in  diluted earnings per share were for  including per share of restructuring and related charges 
versus for the year ended december   net sales increased percent 
currency translation was a benefit to net sales growth of percent 
the remaining percent increase in net sales reflects increased sales of higher priced  value added products in each of the two business segments 
diluted earnings per share were for  including per share of restructuring and related charges 
for  diluted earnings per share totaled  including approximately per share of tax charges related to the repatriation of international subsidiary earnings under the american jobs creation act of the improvement in resulted from a more profitable sales mix  a moderating raw material cost environment  and successful cost management efforts 
flexible packaging business segment our flexible packaging business segment provides packaging to a variety of end markets  including meat and cheese  confectionery and snack  frozen foods  lawn and garden  health and hygiene  beverages  medical devices  bakery  and dry foods 
during  consumer demand for products in many of the food markets appeared to be negatively impacted by the increased budget pressure imposed by higher costs for food  energy  and sub prime mortgage related debt service 
the resulting lower order volume for related packaging had a negative impact on capacity utilization and production efficiencies in our manufacturing plants during the year 
the most significant raw materials used in this business segment are polymer resins  which we use to develop and manufacture single layer and multilayer film products 
selling price changes generally lag behind changes in our raw material costs 
during  resin costs dramatically increased resulting in double digit percentage increases for the year 
the magnitude and frequency of these cost increases negatively impacted operating profit 
compared to  the impact of raw material cost changes in and was more moderate 
in january of  we announced a restructuring plan to close five flexible packaging plants in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency throughout this business segment 
these efforts were substantially completed by december  restructuring and related charges for the flexible packaging business segment totaled million in the disposal of facilities closed during the restructuring program resulted in a charge of million in dollars in millions net sales operating profit see note to the consolidated financial statements operating profit as a percentage of net sales versus net sales in our flexible packaging business segment were virtually unchanged from to a benefit from currency translation of percent was completely offset by weak demand across many of our packaging markets 
net sales of packaging for meat and cheese  which represent about percent of our flexible packaging net sales  decreased about percent excluding the impact of currency 
packaging for bakery products and dry foods  for which consumer demand has been impacted by increased wheat prices  experienced a drop in net sales of about percent from levels 
packaging for pet products and industrial products also decreased over percent in packaging for bakery  dry foods  pet products  and industrial products represents about percent of flexible packaging net sales 
growth in other flexible packaging markets representing a combined percent of total flexible packaging net sales substantially offset the impact of these decreases 
packaging for dairy and liquid products and overwrap for bottled beverages each increased by about percent 
net sales of medical device packaging increased almost percent compared to  despite a slowdown related to a period of manufacturing shutdown during in order to move equipment to a new facility in northern ireland 
new business awarded in is expected to begin shipping in  and we believe the growth markets will experience strong sales growth again in we also expect general food and consumer product markets to provide the stability and defensive characteristics during that we have historically associated with those markets 
operating profit as a percentage of net sales increased to percent in from percent in restructuring and related activities resulted in million of operating income in and a million reduction in operating profit in during  operating profit was negatively impacted by the lower unit sales volume noted in the previous paragraph and a steady increase in raw material costs 
raw material costs are expected to continue to rise throughout our method of passing these costs on to customers through increased selling prices normally occurs with a several month lag  adding pressure to operating profit levels during that period 
cost management initiatives are expected to help offset the impact of inflation during versus our flexible packaging business segment recorded a percent increase in net sales in currency translation represented a benefit of percent 
the remaining percent increase is attributable to increased net sales for packaging in markets such as meat and cheese  health and hygiene  coffee  unitizing films for cans and bottles  and medical devices 
this was partially offset by lower net sales for markets such as confectionery  snack and frozen foods 
operating profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to percent in from percent in during  restructuring and related charges totaling million were recorded as a reduction of operating profit 
operating profit in benefited from stronger sales of value added flexible packaging products 
during  operating profit includes the impact of restructuring and related charges totaling million 
pressure sensitive materials business segment the pressure sensitive materials business segment offers adhesive products to three markets prime and variable information labels  which include roll label stock used in a wide variety of label markets  graphic design  used to create signage and decorations  and technical components  which represent pressure sensitive components for industries such as the electronics  automotive  construction and medical industries 
paper and adhesive are the primary raw materials used in our pressure sensitive materials business segment 
for the last several years  general economic conditions and competitive pressures have had a greater influence on selling prices and operating performance than raw material costs 
in january of  we announced a restructuring plan which included the closure of one pressure sensitive materials plant in order to consolidate production capacity and improve overall cost structure and efficiency 
this effort was completed by december  restructuring and related charges incurred for this business segment totaled million in these costs were primarily employee related costs and were recorded as a component of other costs income  net 
during  a net gain of million was recorded for the sale of previously closed facilities and property 
during  we changed the year end of our pressure sensitive materials european subsidiary from november to december this resulted in a month reporting period in for this subsidiary  increasing net sales by million 
the impact on operating profit was insignificant 
dollars in millions net sales operating profit see note to the consolidated financial statements operating profit as a percentage of net sales versus our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales increase of percent in  reflecting a benefit from currency translation of percent  substantially offset by lower unit sales for label and technical products 
increased industry capacity for label products dampened unit sales volume and pricing during  resulting in a percent decrease in net sales of label products  excluding the impact of currency 
technical product net sales decreased by over percent as customers faced economic challenges associated with the housing and medical markets 
graphic product net sales increased by about percent during operating profit as a percent of net sales was lower in compared to  reflecting decreased sales of value added technical products and a lower margin sales mix in our graphic product sales 
versus our pressure sensitive materials business segment reported a net sales increase of percent in net sales in include the impact of the thirteenth month of net sales from the european subsidiary 
the increase in net sales in was driven by unit sales volume growth in each of the pressure sensitive materials product lines during the year 
currency benefits provided less than one percent net sales growth in operating profit as a percent of sales improved in compared to  reflecting increased sales of value added graphic and technical products 
in addition  the profitability of the label product line increased with continued improvements in cost management and production efficiency 
currency translation did not impact operating profit in consolidated gross margin dollars in millions gross margin gross margin as a percentage of net sales restructuring and related charges reduced gross margins by million in and million in the time lag between increases in raw material costs and the implementation of related selling price increases negatively impacted gross margins as a percent of net sales in each of the years presented 
in addition  lower production volume associated with weak consumer demand for products in our markets reduced fixed cost absorption during the impact of these cost pressures was partially offset by ongoing initiatives to improve production efficiency and cost management during the same timeframe 
management expects increased sales volume in to improve gross margin as a percentage of net sales by providing increased opportunities to recognize the benefits of capacity improvements and process improvements completed during consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses dollars in millions selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a as a percentage of net sales other expenses dollars in millions research and development r d r d as a percentage of net sales interest expense other costs income  net minority interest in net income income taxes effective tax rate research and development our efforts to introduce new products continue at a steady pace and are an integral part of our daily plant operations 
our research and development engineers work directly on commercial production equipment  bringing new products to market without the use of pilot equipment 
we believe this approach significantly improves the efficiency  effectiveness and relevance of our research and development activities and results in earlier commercialization of new products 
expenditures that are not distinctly identifiable as research and development costs are included in costs of products sold 
interest expense interest expense increased modestly during with slightly higher debt levels 
the increase in interest expense in reflects higher interest rates in compared to the percentage of variable rate debt included in total debt is about percent in  percent in  and percent in the effective interest rate was percent in  percent in  and percent in other costs income  net in  other costs income included million of financial income  about half of which relates to interest income on cash held at non us locations 
the remainder of the financial income is generated from fiscal incentives for certain flexible packaging locations and is considered as a part of flexible packaging operating profit 
these fiscal incentives are associated with net sales in south america and are expected to continue to grow at a modest pace over the next few years in conjunction with sales growth in that region 
in  other costs income included million of restructuring and related charges  which were more than offset by financial income of million and a million favorable resolution of a litigated foreign excise tax liability 
in  net other costs primarily reflect interest income offset by currency exchange losses 
minority interest in net income minority interest in net income is primarily associated with the accounting for the outstanding preferred shares of dixie toga that were not acquired in connection with the january business acquisition 
our ownership in dixie toga had increased from approximately percent to approximately percent as of december  in april  we acquired the remaining minority interest in our three mexican joint ventures which further reduced minority interest in net income 
there were no ownership changes in income taxes the difference between our overall tax rate and the us statutory rate of percent in each of the three years presented principally relates to state and local income taxes net of federal income tax benefits 
our effective tax rate was percent for  a decrease from our effective tax rate of percent for and percent in this lower tax rate reflects benefits related to dividends from a foreign subsidiary  the increasing impact of us tax incentives for manufacturing companies  and a change in the geographic mix of pretax income 
during  an additional million of tax expense was recorded as a result of the repatriation of international subsidiary earnings under the american jobs creation act of  increasing the effective tax rate for from percent to percent 
liquidity and capital resources debt to total capitalization debt to total capitalization which includes total debt  long term deferred tax liabilities and equity was percent at december   compared to percent at december  and percent at december  total debt was million  million  and million at year end  and  respectively 
credit rating our capital structure and financial practices have earned bemis company long term credit ratings of a from standard poor s and baa from moody s investors service  and a credit rating of a and prime for our commercial paper program from standard poor s and moody s investor service  respectively 
our strong financial positions and credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of interest 
sources of liquidity cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million in and million in cash provided by operations in each of the years ended december  and was reduced by voluntary pension contributions to our us pension plans of million and million  respectively 
while no contributions were required for our us pension plans in  we continue to monitor the funded status of all pension plans and will evaluate the benefits of future voluntary contributions subject to available liquidity 
in addition to using cash provided by operations  we issue commercial paper to meet our short term liquidity needs 
at year end  our commercial paper debt outstanding was million 
based upon our current credit rating  we enjoy ready access to the commercial paper markets 
while not anticipated  if these markets were to become illiquid or if a credit rating downgrade limited our ability to issue commercial paper  we would draw upon our existing back up credit facility 
in september  we renegotiated our back up credit facility to extend the term to september this credit facility provides million of available financing supported by a group of major us and international banks 
covenants imposed by this bank credit facility include limits on the sale of businesses  minimum net worth calculations  and a maximum ratio of debt to total capitalization 
in addition to funds available under this credit facility  we also have the capability of issuing up to approximately million of extendable commercial notes ecns  which are short term instruments whose maturity can be extended to days from the date of issuance 
if these credit facilities and ecns were no longer available to us  we would expect to meet our financial liquidity needs by accessing the bank market  which would increase our borrowing costs 
the million credit facility includes a million multicurrency limit to support the financing needs of our international subsidiaries 
as of december   outstanding multicurrency borrowings under the credit facility totaled million 
borrowings from the credit agreement mature in september and are subject to a variable interest rate 
as of december   available capacity on the credit agreement which matures in september was million 
long term debt commercial paper outstanding at december   has been classified as long term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance such obligations on a long term basis 
the related back up credit agreement expires on september  in august  public bonds totaling million will mature 
these bonds have also been classified as long term debt in accordance with our intention and ability to refinance this debt in the public bond market or with commercial paper 
uses of liquidity capital expenditures capital expenditures were million during  compared to million in  and million in capital expenditures during the years presented supported multiyear investments for new facilities and equipment for the medical and pharmaceutical markets  a platform for rigid polyester packaging products  additional converting equipment in our malaysian operation  and proprietary film production capacity for european markets 
with these projects substantially completed  capital expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million 
over the long term  we expect average annual capital expenditures to be approximately equivalent to total annual depreciation and amortization expenses 
dividends we increased our quarterly cash dividend by percent during the first quarter of to cents per share from cents per share 
this follows increases of percent in and percent in in february  the board of directors approved the th consecutive annual increase in the quarterly cash dividend on common stock to cents per share  a percent increase 
share repurchases during  we purchased million shares of common stock  of which million shares were repurchased in conjunction with an accelerated share repurchase program 
the remaining million shares were purchased in the open market 
during and  we purchased million and million shares of common stock in the open market  respectively 
as of december   we were authorized to purchase up to million shares of additional common stock for the treasury 
contractual obligations the following table provides a summary of contractual obligations including our debt payment obligations  capital lease obligations  operating lease obligations and certain other purchase obligations as of december  contractual payments due by period less than to to more than in millions total year years years years debt payments interest expense capital leases operating leases purchase obligations postretirement obligations pursuant to the application of fin  the company has accrued income tax liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions 
these liabilities have been excluded from the table above due to the high degree of uncertainty as to amounts and timing regarding future payments 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
these amounts are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
a portion of this debt is commercial paper backed by a bank credit facility that expires on september  public bonds totaling million that mature in august are assumed to be refinanced with commercial paper upon maturity 
a portion of the interest expense disclosed is subject to variable interest rates 
the amounts disclosed above assume that variable interest rates are equal to rates at december  amount noted also includes estimated interest costs 
the present value of these obligations  excluding interest  is included on our consolidated balance sheet 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our capital lease obligations 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payments terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the options to renew the lease 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
purchase obligations represent contracts or commitments for the purchase of raw materials  utilities  capital equipment and various other goods and services 
postretirement obligations represent contracts or commitments for postretirement healthcare benefits and benefit payments for the unfunded bemis supplemental retirement plan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about our postretirement benefit obligations 
interest rate swaps our long term unsecured notes include million due in august in september  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with two us banks  which increased our exposure to variable rates 
we generally prefer variable rate debt since it has been our experience that borrowing at variable rates is less expensive than borrowing at fixed rates over the long term 
these interest rate swap agreements  which expire in  reduced the interest cost of the million of long term debt from percent to about percent in since these variable rates are based upon six month london interbank offered rates libor  calculated in arrears  at the semiannual interest payment dates of the corresponding notes  increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require that the fair value of these swaps  which have been designated as hedges of our fixed rate unsecured notes outstanding  be recorded as an asset or liability of the company 
the fair value of these swaps was recorded as an asset of million at december   and an asset of million at december  for each period  an offsetting increase is recorded in the fair value of the related long term notes outstanding 
these fair value adjustments do not impact the actual balance of outstanding principal on the notes  nor do they impact the income statement or related cash flows 
credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
market risks and foreign currency exposures we enter into contractual arrangements derivatives in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure and interest rate risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading purposes 
our use of derivative instruments is subject to internal policies that provide guidelines for control  counterparty risk  and ongoing reporting 
these derivative instruments are designed to reduce the income statement volatility associated with movement in foreign exchange rates  establish rates for future issuance of public bonds  and to achieve greater exposure to variable interest rates 
interest expense calculated on our outstanding debt is substantially subject to short term interest rates 
as such  increases in short term interest rates will directly impact the amount of interest we pay 
for each one percent increase in variable interest rates  the annual interest expense on million of variable rate debt outstanding would increase by million 
our international operations enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts to manage foreign currency exchange rate exposures associated with certain foreign currency denominated receivables and payables 
at december  and  we had outstanding forward exchange contracts with notional amounts aggregating million and million  respectively 
forward exchange contracts generally have maturities of less than six months 
counterparties to the forward exchange contracts are major financial institutions 
credit loss from counterparty nonperformance is not anticipated 
we have not designated these derivative instruments as hedging instruments 
the net settlement amount fair value related to the active forward foreign currency exchange contacts is insignificant and recorded on the balance sheet within current liabilities and as an element of other costs income  net  which offsets the related transactions gains and losses on the related foreign denominated asset or liability 
the operating results of our international operations are recorded in local currency and translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes 
the impact of foreign currency translation on net sales was an increase of million in and million in operating profit improved by approximately million in and million in as a result of the positive effect of foreign currency translation 
long term compensation our practice of awarding long term compensation has relied primarily on restricted stock unit programs that are valued at the time of the award and expensed over the vesting period 
beginning in  we discontinued the awarding of stock options 
stock options granted prior to were granted at prices equal to the fair market value on the date of grant and exercisable  upon vesting  over varying periods up to ten years from the date of grant 
stock options for directors vested immediately  while options for company employees generally become vested over three years one third per year 
beginning january   accounting rules require us to follow a fair value based method of recognizing expense for stock options 
the impact to diluted earnings per share for stock options expense in was insignificant 
if we had followed this fair value method prior to  the negative impact on diluted earnings per share would have been one cent for the year ended critical accounting estimates and judgments our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to retirement benefits  intangible assets  goodwill  and expected future performance of operations 
our estimates and judgments are based upon historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the calculation of annual pension costs and related assets and liabilities  and the valuation and useful lives of intangible assets and goodwill 
accounting for annual pension costs we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with fas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  as amended by fas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
fas no 
requires us to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of the pension plans on our balance sheet 
a substantial portion of our pension amounts relate to our defined benefit plans in the united states 
net periodic pension costs recorded in was million  compared to pension cost of million in and million in effective january   our us defined benefit pension plans were amended for approximately two thirds of the participant population 
for those employees impacted  future pension benefits were replaced with a defined contribution plan which is subject to achievement of certain financial performance goals of the company 
as a result  future pension liability is no longer adjusted for additional years of service for those employees impacted by the amendment and the related service cost and pension expense have decreased 
one element used in determining annual pension income and expense in accordance with accounting rules is the expected return on plan assets 
as of january   in conjunction with a change in the allocation of the us pension assets to equity investments from percent to percent of total assets  we have reduced our expected long term rate of return on plan assets to percent 
for the years   and  we maintained a target allocation to equity investments of percent of total assets and had assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would be percent 
to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption  we considered compound historical returns and future expectations based upon our target asset allocation 
using historical long term investment periods of  and years  our pension plan assets have earned rates of return of percent  percent and percent  respectively 
considering these long term results  we selected an percent long term rate of return on assets assumption as of january  using our target asset allocation of plan assets of percent equity securities and percent fixed income securities  our outside actuaries have used their independent economic model to calculate a range of expected long term rates of return and have determined our assumptions to be reasonable 
this assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over approximately three years 
this process calculates the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension income or expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is generally deferred and recognized over subsequent periods 
the net deferral of asset gains and losses affects the calculated value of pension plan assets and  ultimately  future pension income and expense 
at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of pension plan liabilities 
this discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  we look to changes in rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   for our us defined benefit pension plans we determined this rate to be percent  an increase of one half of one percent from the percent rate used at december  pension assumptions sensitivity analysis based upon current assumptions of percent for the discount rate and percent for the expected rate of return on pension plan assets  we expect pension expense before the effect of income taxes for to be in a range of million to million 
the following charts depict the sensitivity of estimated pension expense to incremental changes in the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on assets 
total increase decrease total increase decrease to pension expense to pension expense dollars in millions from current assumptions from current assumptions discount rate rate of return on plan assets percent percent percent percent percent percent percent current assumption percent current assumption percent percent percent percent percent percent in accordance with fas no 
 the amount by which the fair value of plan assets differs from the projected benefit obligation of a pension plan must be recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as an asset  in the case of an overfunded plan  or as a liability  in the case of an underfunded plan 
the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of pension cost are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income 
the following chart depicts the sensitivity of the total pension adjustment to other comprehensive income to changes in the assumed discount rate 
total increase decrease in accumulated other comprehensive dollars in millions income  net of taxes  from current assumptions discount rate percent percent percent percent current assumption percent percent percent intangible assets and goodwill the purchase price of each new acquisition is allocated to tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets  liabilities assumed  and goodwill 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to identifiable intangible assets and goodwill requires us to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to intangible assets is generally determined by estimating the future cash flows of each asset and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired  including intangible assets 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually and assess whether significant events or changes in the business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
our estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
goodwill was million as of december  intangible assets consist primarily of purchased technology  customer relationships  patents  trademarks  and tradenames and are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  which range from one to years  when purchased 
we review these intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest that the remaining value is not recoverable 
the test for impairment requires us to make estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
these estimates and projections require judgments as to future events  condition and amounts of future cash flows 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
fas no 
 which amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
the standard is effective for the company on january  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fas no 
on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
revised  business combinations fas r 
fas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements  the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations 
fas r is effective on a prospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  any business combination we enter into after december  will be subject to this new standard 
in february  the fasb issued fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
fas no 
 which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the standard is effective for the company on january   and its adoption then is not expected to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued fas no 
 fair value measurements fas no 
 which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fas no 
will apply whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances  and is effective for the company on january  in early  the fasb issued staff position fsp fas  which delays by one year  the effective date of fas no 
for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on at least an annual basis 
we do not expect the adoption of fas no 
in to have a material effect on the measurement of the company s financial assets and liabilities 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact the standard will have on the determination of fair value related to non financial assets and non financial liabilities in years after forward looking statements this annual report contains certain estimates  predictions  and other forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of  and within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended
