our strategy for long term  sustained growth is to maintain and improve our position as a leading global provider of integrated sales and marketing solutions 
key elements of our strategy include continuing to enhance the execution of our service offerings to generate more revenue for our existing clients thereby increasing our revenue  continuing to seek cross selling opportunities to increase the range of services provided to our more than existing clients  expand our offerings to address international opportunities  signing new clients  continuing to identify new services and capabilities that enhance or complement our revenue delivery platform and selectively pursuing strategic acquisitions 
prior to  substantially all of our net revenue was derived from the commissions we earned on the sale of service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranties 
since  we have added multiple sources of revenue  including lead development services and hosted application software 
background we completed our initial public offering in november  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
during the period from the initial public offering through  we focused on expanding our market share of the sale of service contracts for our clients 
in february  we completed our first acquisition  sunset direct  which added a new service offering the generation of sales leads  or lead generation  for clients 
sunset direct provided us with new clients for our service contract sales solution 
we relocated most of our operations from california to sunset direct s lower cost location in texas 
our net revenues grew to million in from million in this growth was due both to million  or  year over year growth excluding acquisitions in our service contract sales solution and million from our lead development services 
in  we incurred losses of million  due in part to redundancy  severance and other transition costs incurred in moving our base of operations to texas 
we achieved our first profitable quarter in the period ended march  due primarily to revenue growth from existing and new customers and the lower costs resulting from the relocation of our operations to texas 
our acquisition of viewcentral in september added hosted application software for training sales to 
table of contents our service offerings and a significant new customer base 
we reported net revenue of million for the year  representing year over year growth  excluding acquisitions  of  in addition to the million of net revenue from our hosted application software for training sales offering 
we were profitable in each quarter of and reported net income of million for the year 
in january  we acquired cas systems to provide additional complementary lead development functionality  customers  execution expertise and an international presence with its location near montreal  canada 
in july  we purchased all of the outstanding stock of qinteraction limited  which operates an offshore call center located in the philippines 
qinteraction provides a variety of business solutions including inbound sales and order taking  inbound customer care  outbound telemarketing and lead generation  logistics support  and back office processing 
the nature of these services are highly complimentary to our existing lead development and contract sales product offerings 
we reported net revenue of million in  representing a growth over the prior year 
we were once again profitable in each quarter of and reported net income of million for the year 
in february  we received written notification from dell  our largest customer  that they will be terminating our service agreement 
for the year ended december   dell accounted for of our net revenue and approximately of our net revenue for the fourth quarter of during the year ended december   dell accounted for approximately of our net revenue 
with this loss of this client  we expect our net revenue to be negatively impacted until we are able to replace the loss of dell with new business and with additional business from our existing clients 
net revenue we derive revenue from the following the sale of service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranties contract sales  from the provision of services related to the development of qualified leads and appointments lead development  and from the licensing of our hosted application software platform for our clients training sales training sales 
service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranty extensions contract sales 
we sell  on behalf of our clients  service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions and warranty extensions 
we earn commissions on the sale of these services to our clients customers  which we report as our revenue 
we are typically responsible for the complete sales process  including marketing and customer identification and order processing 
we also take responsibility for collecting the amount paid by our client s customer 
as a result  when we complete a sale  we record the full amount of the sale on our balance sheet as accounts receivable 
we record revenue for the commissions we earn on the transaction  which is based on a fixed percentage of the renewal amount based on the agreement with our client 
we record the difference between the sale amount and our commission as an account payable  representing the amount we will remit to our client according to our payment terms  generally to days from the initial sale 
our clients customers pay us by credit card  check or on payment terms which are generally days from sale  and none of our clients customers represented more than of our revenue 
because our revenue from sales of service contract renewals  software licenses and subscriptions  and warranty extensions are commission based  this revenue can vary significantly 
our agreements with our clients for these services typically have two to three year terms  with automatic renewal provisions 
these agreements are generally terminable on to days notice by either party 
we recently started to provide hosted application software which enables our clients resellers to renew service contracts with end users directly 
in these situations we earn commissions on sales by our clients or their resellers but take no responsibility or credit risk for collection from the end user of the services 
lead development 
we provide lead development services to generate  qualify and develop corporate leads  turning these prospects into sales opportunities and qualified appointments for our clients field sales 
table of contents forces and for their channel partners 
our agreements with our clients are generally for fixed fees  have terms ranging from three months to one year and require us to provide fixed resources for the term of the contract 
some of our contracts contain performance requirements 
for the significant majority of our lead generation agreements  we recognize revenue as our services are provided  for our performance based contracts  we recognize revenue as we meet the performance objectives 
to the extent that our clients pay us in advance of the provision of services  we record deferred revenue and recognize the revenue ratably over the contract period 
application software training sales 
we license our hosted application software that our clients use to manage their online and in person training programs 
the licenses are usually for one year terms  and are often paid in advance 
these advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue  and recognized ratably over the contract period 
gross margin gross margin is calculated as net revenue less the costs associated with selling our clients products or delivering our services to our clients 
cost of services include compensation costs of sales personnel  sales commissions and bonuses  costs of designing  producing and delivering marketing services  credit card fees  bad debts  and salaries and other personnel expenses related to fee based activities 
costs of services also include the cost of allocated facility and telephone usage for our telesales representatives as well as other direct costs associated with the delivery of our services 
cost of services related to training sales relates primarily to the cost of personnel to support our hosted application 
most of the costs of services are personnel related and are relatively fixed 
bonuses and sales commissions will typically change in proportion to net revenue or profitability 
commission and bonus expense included in gross margin are related to incentives paid to our telesales representatives for incremental sales of our clients contracts and leads generated 
our gross margins will fluctuate in the future with changes in our product mix 
margins from sales of our clients service contract renewals are higher than our lead generation services  and licensing from our hosted application software is our highest margin service 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses are primarily costs associated with client acquisition  including compensation costs of marketing and sales personnel  sales commissions  bonuses  marketing and promotional expenses  participation in trade shows and conferences and client integration costs 
commission expense included in sales and marketing expenses relates to the variable compensation paid to our sales people who generate sales growth from new and existing clients 
the sales cycle required to generate new clients varies within our product mix 
in some cases  the lead time to create a new client can be substantial and we will incur sales and marketing costs for efforts that may not be successful 
technology and development expenses technology and development expenses include costs associated with the technology infrastructure that supports our rainmaker revenue delivery platform 
these costs include compensation and related costs for technology personnel  consultants  purchases of non capitalizable software and hardware  and support and maintenance costs related to our systems 
we are also investing in the continued development of our revenue delivery platform 
technology and development expenses do not include depreciation of hardware and software systems 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include costs associated with the administration of our business and consist primarily of compensation and related costs for administrative personnel  insurance  and legal and other professional fees 
most of these costs relate to personnel  insurance and facilities and are relatively fixed 
in 
table of contents we were required to be compliant with the auditor attestation provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of we incurred substantial additional costs in to achieve this compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and therefore expect to continue to incur significant costs in general and administrative expenses in future years to maintain compliance 
we will also incur costs in to achieve section compliance by december  for our cas systems and qinteraction limited operations acquired in stock based compensation prior to  cost of revenue and operating expenses include stock based compensation expense to the extent the fair value of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of stock options granted to employees on the date of grant 
effective in the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted accounting provisions pursuant to the requirements of sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r addresses all forms of share based payment awards  including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
sfas r requires us to expense share based payment awards with compensation cost for share based payment transactions measured at fair value 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation and amortization of property  equipment and software licenses  and intangible assets 
we have completed the acquisition of six businesses in the past three years  and accordingly have been increasing our intangible amortization expense 
in the first quarter of  we completed the acquisition of cas systems  and in the third quarter of  we completed the acquisition of qinteraction limited  and will therefore incur higher intangible asset amortization in the future 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net reflects income received on cash and cash equivalents  interest expense on leases to secure equipment  software and other financing agreements  foreign currency gains losses  and other income and expense 
critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
although actual results have historically been reasonably consistent with management s expectations  future results may differ from these estimates or our estimates may be affected by different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors and has reviewed the disclosures of such policies and management s estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we disclosed our critical accounting policies and estimates in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  management believes there have been no significant changes during the year ended december  use of estimates the preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures  in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  requires us to establish accounting policies that contain estimates and assumptions 
table of contents that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the policies that contain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes include revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  intangible assets and property and equipment  measurement of our deferred tax assets and corresponding valuation allowance  allocation of purchase price in business combinations  fair value estimates for the expense of employee stock options 
we have other equally important accounting policies and practices 
however  once adopted  these policies either generally do not require us to make significant estimates or assumptions or otherwise only require implementation of the adopted policy  not a judgment as to the application of policy itself 
despite our intention to establish accurate estimates and assumptions  actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition and financial statement presentation substantially all of our revenue is generated from the sale of service contract renewals  lead development services and software licenses for hosted application software for training sales 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our clients service contract renewals under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition and on the net basis in accordance with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
revenue from the sale of service contract renewals is recognized when an order from the client s customer is received  the service contract agreement is delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  the collection of the receivable is reasonably assured  and no significant post delivery obligations remain unfulfilled 
revenue from lead development services we perform is recognized as the services are delivered and is generally earned ratably over the service contract period 
some of our lead development service revenue is earned when we achieve certain attainment levels and is recognized upon customer acceptance of the service 
we earn revenue from our licensing of hosted software applications for training sales ratably over each contract period  having considered eitf application of aicpa sop  software revenue recognition  to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  which distinguishes hosting services that might fall under the scope of sop software revenue recognition 
since these software licenses are usually paid in advance  we record a deferred revenue liability on our balance sheet that represents the prepaid portions of licenses that will be earned over the next one to two years 
we also evaluate our agreements for multiple element arrangements  taking into consideration the guidance from both eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and tpa software revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements 
our agreements typically do not contain multiple deliverables 
however  in the few instances where our agreements have contained multiple deliverables  they do not have value to our customers on a standalone basis  and therefore the deliverables are considered together as one unit of accounting 
revenue is then recorded using the proportional performance model  where revenue is recognized as performance occurs  based on the relative value of the performance that has occurred at that point in time compared to that of the total contract 
our revenue recognition policy involves significant judgments and estimates about collectibility 
we assess the probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and or the 
table of contents creditworthiness of our clients customers  which is based on current published credit ratings  current events and circumstances regarding the business of our clients customer and other factors that we believe are relevant 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  we defer revenue recognition until such time as collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash payment 
in addition we provide an allowance in accrued liabilities for the cancellation of service contracts that occurs within a specified time after the sale  which is typically less than days 
this amount is calculated based on historical results and constitutes a reduction of the net revenue we record for the commission we earn on the sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients and clients customers to make required payments of amounts due to us 
the allowance is comprised of specifically identified account balances for which collection is currently deemed doubtful 
in addition to specifically identified accounts  estimates of amounts that may not be collectible from those accounts whose collection is not yet deemed doubtful but which may become doubtful in the future are made based on historical bad debt write off experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
at december  and  our allowance for potentially uncollectible accounts was  and  respectively 
long lived assets long lived assets excluding goodwill including our purchased intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
in accordance with fasb no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property  equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
goodwill and other intangible assets we apply the guidance of the financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 business combinations in accounting for the assets related to our acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the acquisition purchase price over the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
in our analysis of goodwill and other intangible assets we apply the guidance of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in determining whether any impairment conditions exist 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
intangible assets are attributable to the various technologies  customer relationships and tradenames of the businesses we have acquired 
no circumstances or indicators have arisen to indicate that the carrying value has been impaired 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation of property and equipment is recorded using the straight line method over the assets estimated useful lives 
computer equipment and capitalized software are 
table of contents depreciated over two to five years and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over five years 
amortization of leasehold improvements is recorded using the straight line method over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives of the assets 
amortization of fixed assets under capital leases is included in depreciation expense 
costs of internal use software are accounted for in accordance with statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and emerging issue task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for website development costs 
sop and eitf require that we expense computer software and website development costs as they are incurred during the preliminary project stage 
once the capitalization criteria of sop and eitf have been met  external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  including website development  the payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the internal use computer software and associated interest costs  are capitalized 
capitalized costs are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the term of related client agreement  if such development relates to a specific client  or the software s estimated useful life  ranging from two to five years 
capitalized internal use software and website development costs are included in property and equipment in the accompanying balance sheets 
during  we put in place a new customer relationship management system that included capitalized internal development costs 
in total  the system cost million and is being amortized over five years on a straight line basis 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value 
therefore  we provide a valuation allowance to the extent that we do not believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income in future periods to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
at december  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of million and million  respectively 
in and  the deferred tax asset was subject to a valuation allowance and therefore is not recorded on our balance sheet as an asset 
realization of our deferred tax assets is limited and we may not be able to fully utilize these deferred tax assets to reduce our tax rates 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in any entity s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fin provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have adopted fin effective january  and as a result of the adoption  the company recognized no adjustment to retained earnings and no change in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which establishes standards for the accounting of transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services  primarily focusing on accounting for transactions where an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 

table of contents the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of the company s fiscal year the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december  and reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations  other than option grants to employees and directors below the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
see note for further discussion of this statement and its effects on the financial statements presented herein 
foreign currency translation during january  we established a canadian foreign subsidiary and subsequently purchased the canadian based assets of cas systems 
additionally  in july  we purchased qinteraction limited and its philippine based subsidiary 
the functional currency of our canadian and philippine subsidiaries was determined to be their respective local currencies canadian dollar and philippine peso  in accordance with fas  foreign currency translation 
foreign currency assets and liabilities are translated at the current exchange rates at the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates in effect during the year 
the related unrealized gains and losses from foreign currency translation are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss 
net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are included in interest and other income expense  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
significant client concentrations in  dell and hewlett packard each accounted for more than of our net revenue and collectively represented of our net revenue  with dell representing 
in  these two clients accounted for of our net revenue  with dell representing of our net revenue 
in  these two clients accounted for of net revenue  with dell accounting for of our net revenue 
in february  we received written notification from dell that they will be terminating our service agreement 
under dell s transition plan set forth in the notice  dell moved approximately half of the services provided by us under the agreement internally effective february   and intends to move the remainder over the subsequent three months  at the conclusion of which the company would no longer be performing any services for dell 
dell accounted for of our net revenue for the fourth quarter of no individual client s end user customer accounted for or more of our net revenue in any period presented 
we have service agreements with our clients that expire at various dates ranging through may many of our client agreements contain automatic renewal clauses 
these clients may  however  terminate their contracts for cause in accordance with the provisions of each contract 
substantially all clients must provide us with advance written notice of their intention to terminate 
hewlett packard may terminate their contract with 
table of contents days notice 
any loss or reduction of business of a significant client would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  cash flows and results of operations 
we expect that a substantial portion of our net revenue will continue to be concentrated among a few significant clients 
in addition  our technology clients operate in industries that are experiencing consolidation  which may reduce the number of our existing and potential clients 
related party transactions we have made purchases of computer equipment and services from several vendors including dell and hewlett packard  our two largest clients as of december  during the year ended december   we purchased equipment from dell and hewlett packard totaling approximately  and  respectively

net revenue increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  our lead development product line 
table of contents generated million of the increase which includes approximately million resulting from the acquisitions of cas systems and qinteraction in january and july  respectively 
approximately million of the increase is related to our contract sales product line primarily due to increased sales from existing clients and approximately million of the increase is related to our training sales product line which was acquired in september costs of services and gross margin 
costs of services increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   as compared to the comparative period 
the increase was primarily due to approximately million in expenses from viewcentral  cas systems and qinteraction that were acquired in september  january and july  respectively 
the remaining portion of the increase is primarily due to increases in compensation costs which include salaries  bonuses and commissions related to the hiring of additional staff and increases in outsourced services to support the increased sales volume in all of our product lines 
our gross margin percentage declined slightly to in the period from in the year ended december  as lead development became a larger percentage of our revenue with the acquisitions of cas systems and qinteraction 
historically  revenue from lead development has a lower margin than revenue from contract sales 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to approximately million in expenses from viewcentral  cas systems and qinteraction that were acquired in september  january and july  respectively 
additionally  increased compensation costs and travel entertainment costs as a result of the addition of staff to our sales force and increased commissions from increased sales during the period contributed to the overall increase 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars and slightly as a percentage of sales in as a result of our larger sales force and increased sales and marketing costs associated with the operations of our recent acquisitions 
technology and development expenses 
technology and development expenses increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   as compared to the comparative period 
we are engaged in continuing significant efforts to enhance our infrastructure and integrate our recent acquisitions 
approximately million of the increase between the comparative periods is due to increased temporary staffing  outsourced services and consultants for our infrastructure enhancements as well as the continued support of the database infrastructure which we rely on to service our customers 
we believe that by using outsourced hosting for parts of our technology infrastructure  we will be able to better leverage our technology infrastructure for the future expansion of our business 
additionally  approximately million of the increase was due to increased compensation costs for additional staff added to support the growth in our business 
the remaining increase was primarily the result of our recent acquisitions and the additional technology and development expense from these entities 
we expect technology and development expenses to increase on an absolute dollar basis and as a percentage of net revenues in as we continue to invest in development of our solutions  including internationalization of our solutions  for our customers and in technology infrastructure 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the overall increase was primarily due to approximately million in increased compensation costs for additional staff added to support the growth of the business and to assist in the company s compliance efforts related to sarbanes oxley  and increased audit and consulting fees of approximately  from sarbanes oxley preparation and implementation 
as a result of our recent acquisitions  we incurred approximately million in additional general and administrative expense during we expect to incur additional costs in and beyond to maintain compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and we will also need to achieve compliance for our operations in canada and the philippines that were acquired in therefore  we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in 
table of contents depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to the period 
amortization of intangible assets increased by approximately million in the period primarily as a result of the acquisitions of viewcentral in september  and cas systems and qinteraction during the remaining increase is due to increased depreciation of property and equipment as a result of our acquisitions and capital expenditures over the last year 
because of our acquisitions and the investments being made in our infrastructure  we expect depreciation and amortization expense to continue to increase in interest and other income expense  net 
the components of interest and other income expense  net are as follows in thousands year ended december  change interest income interest expense currency translation gain other the increase in interest income is attributable to an increase in cash available to invest in interest bearing deposits from the million in net proceeds that we received from our follow on offering of common stock in april interest expense is the result of interest incurred with notes payable issued with the purchase of the assets of cas systems  as well as remaining balances on the million term loan obtained in february in connection with the acquisition of sunset direct  and interest on the million june term loan to fund the purchase and implementation of our new client management system 
in the year ended december   we were required to capitalize  in interest costs associated with the development of our client management system  amortization of which began in had this not been capitalized  interest expense in the period would have been higher than the period 
capitalized interest in amounted to approximately  the currency translation gain is primarily due to the fluctuation of currency exchange rates on a note payable to a third party denominated in united states dollars that is owed by our canadian subsidiary in connection with our acquisition of cas systems 
fluctuations of currency exchange rates may have a negative effect in future periods on our financial results 
income tax expense 
income tax expense increased  or  to  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the company s effective tax rate reflects the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards to offset taxable income 
as of january   texas changed its calculation of franchise tax 
the new calculation is computed on taxable margin  as defined under texas statute 
the increase in income tax expense is primarily due to the increase in the texas state franchise tax and an increase in foreign taxes related to foreign operations commenced in and companies acquired during comparison of years ended december  and net revenue 
net revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in revenue from service contract sales grew million  or  to million substantially as a result of increased sales from existing clients 
revenue from lead development grew million  or  to million primarily due to expansion with existing clients and  to a lesser extent  the addition of new clients 
our acquisition of viewcentral on september  added million in revenue from the licensing of hosted software for training sales 

table of contents costs of services and gross margin 
costs of services increased million  or  to million in from million in our gross margin percentage improved to in from in primarily as a result of the efficiencies and lower costs associated with the move of our base of operations from california to texas which was completed in in  we incurred significant redundancy and transition expenses associated with managing two facilities sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in in we increased our corporate marketing activities by  as a result of the addition of staff  the improvement of our website and participation in trade shows and conferences 
the balance of the increased costs in was due to increased commissions arising from greater success by our sales force and  to a slightly lesser extent  sales and marketing costs associated with viewcentral  which was acquired in september technology and development expenses 
technology expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in despite this significant increase in absolute dollars  technology and development costs decreased as a percentage of net revenue from to 
we are engaged in continuing significant efforts to enhance our infrastructure

certain internal costs were required to be capitalized in connection with this project  which resulted in approximately  less expense in than approximately  of the increase in was due to infrastructure hosting costs associated with additional software and network upgrades

 net revenue costs of services gross margin operating expenses sales and marketing technology and development general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income interest and other income expense  net income before income tax expense income tax expense net income revenue we have increased our revenue sequentially in each quarter over the last years 
these increases have been primarily due to acquisitions along with organic revenue growth in our contract sales and lead development units 
we added our hosted application software for training sales near the end of the third quarter of  which contributed million of revenue in the fourth quarter of and an increase in revenue of approximately million for the fiscal year as compared to the prior year 
in january  we acquired cas systems which contributed million in revenue for in july  we acquired qinteraction limited which contributed million in revenue over the third and fourth quarter of gross margin gross margins remained fairly constant in  with minor fluctuations as a result of changes in our mix of services provided to our clients 
gross margins decreased slightly in as lead development became a larger percentage of our revenue with the acquisitions of cas systems and qinteraction 
historically  revenue from lead development has a lower margin than revenue from contract sales 
operating expenses operating expense as a percentage of revenues increased during fiscal the increase can be attributed to general and administrative expenses as a result of our investments towards the achievement of sarbanes oxley compliance and increases in stock based compensation expense 
we have also incurred increasing technology and development expenses relating to our investment in technology infrastructure  software development and tools in support of future growth  as well as an increase in expense related to supporting client driven initiatives including project management staff and data resources 
income loss from operations we became profitable in the first quarter of and maintained profitability in each quarter of our operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased in due primarily to increases in non cash costs for 
table of contents the amortization of intangibles related to the acquisition of cas systems in january of and qinteraction in july of  and lastly  in the fourth quarter of  an increase in stock based compensation expense as a result of additional equity awards to employees 
liquidity and sources of capital we generated million of cash from operating activities in we used cash in operating activities in substantially all years prior to and we funded our operations from cash proceeds from the sale of common stock and the incurrence of debt 
from through  we raised aggregate net proceeds of million from private placements of common stock  and during we raised net proceeds of million from a follow on offering of common stock 
during  we raised an aggregate of million from term loans from institutional lenders to fund our operations and support our acquisitions of other businesses 
cash flow from operating activities for was million as compared to cash provided by operating activities of million in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily the result of net income totaling million  non cash expenditures of depreciation and amortization of property and intangibles of million  stock based compensation charges of million  the provision for allowance for doubtful accounts of  and changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  that used million of cash for the year 
the two largest components of our changes in operating assets and liabilities are accounts payable and accounts receivable 
when we sell a service or maintenance contract for a client  we record the sales price of the contract to the client s customer as our receivable and also record our payable to the client for our cost of the contract  which is effectively the same amount less our compensation for obtaining the contract for our client 
for this reason  our accounts payable is composed primarily of amounts due to our clients for service and maintenance contracts we sold on their behalf 
accounts payable therefore increases in relation to our increased sales of service contracts on behalf of our clients 
however  because we report as revenue only the net difference between our account receivable from the customer of our client and our account payable to our client in accordance with eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  any increase in net revenue from service contract sales results in a much larger increase in our accounts payable  which is treated as positive cash flow from operating activities 
accounts receivable increased at december  as compared to december  as a result of higher overall sales at the end of as compared to the end of our days sales outstanding  or dso  increased to days at december  as compared to days at december  since we record the gross billing to the end customer of our clients in our accounts receivable  we calculate dso based on our ability to collect those gross billings from the end customers 
for the year ended december   our accounts receivable balance is reflective of an additional million in receivables from cas systems that was acquired on january  additionally  we have approximately million in receivables from qinteraction that was acquired in july the addition of these foreign operations that have slightly longer payment terms has contributed to the increase in dso mentioned above 
cash provided by operating activities in was primarily the result of net income totaling million  non cash expenditures of depreciation and amortization of property and intangibles of million  stock based compensation charges of  the provision for allowance for doubtful accounts of  and changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of assets acquired and liabilities assumed  that provided million 
cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to our acquisition of cas systems in january for which we used cash of approximately million and qinteraction limited in july for which we used cash of approximately million 
additionally  we invested approximately million in purchases of property and equipment and invested million in the purchase of notes receivable and warrants from 
table of contents marketlead 
in the cas systems acquisition  we issued notes payable of approximately million and in the qinteraction limited acquisition we issued approximately million of the company s common stock 
restricted cash represents the reserve for the refund due for non service payments inadvertently paid to the company by its customers instead of paid directly to the company s clients 
at the time of cash receipt the company records a current liability for the amount of non service payments received 
the decrease in restricted cash represents the reduction of our balance of refunds due to customers 
during the year ended december   we completed two business acquisitions 
while the consideration we paid in both acquisitions was predominately our common stock  in the metrics transaction  we incurred  of acquisition costs  and in the viewcentral transaction  we received cash of  net of acquisition costs 
these two items are combined and recorded as acquisitions of businesses  net of cash acquired  in cash provided by financing activities was million in and million in cash provided by financing activities in was primarily a result of the net proceeds of million received from the follow on offering of common stock in april we also received approximately million from the exercise of stock options  warrants and employee stock purchase plan purchases 
these amounts were partially offset by principal payments of million on our term loans and purchases of  of treasury stock from employees and directors for shares withheld for income taxes payable on restricted stock awards vested 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily a result of net proceeds totaling million from our placement of common stock in february we also received million from the exercise of stock options  warrants and employee stock purchase plan purchases 
these amounts were offset in part by principal payments totaling million on our line of credit  term loans and other financing obligations 
in connection with our acquisitions of cas systems in january and qinteraction limited in july  the purchase agreements provide for a potential additional payment at the end of twelve months following each acquisition  based on the achievement of certain financial milestones specific to each individual acquisition 
in the first quarter of the fiscal year  the company paid million relating to the cas systems acquisition 
payment for the qinteraction limited acquisition  if any  will be due during the company s third fiscal quarter of and could result in an additional payment of up to million in cash and million in common stock 
our principal source of liquidity as of december  consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents 
in connection with a financial covenant related to our term loans  we are required to maintain unrestricted cash deposits of  with our lender bridge bank  na  or bridge bank  which is included in the million of cash and cash equivalents

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
we currently do not and do not plan to use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we plan to ensure the safety and preservation of our 
table of contents invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and investment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in low risk securities 
to minimize our risks  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of short term and liquid securities including money market funds  commercial paper  us government and agency securities and municipal bonds 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   of our portfolio was invested in instruments that mature in less than days 
see note of our consolidated financial statements 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of our investment portfolio at december   we do not believe we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
however  based upon the balance in our money market account at december  of approximately million  a change in interest rates would have an approximate annual impact of  on our income before income taxes 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of the february term loan  the june term loan and the revolving credit facility  which bear interest at variable rates based on the prime lending rate at december  
maturity dates on these loans range from october to may at december   we had approximately  of debt outstanding under these loans 
the february term loan matures in february and the june term loan matures in june based on the outstanding principal balance at the end of and the maturity dates of both term loans  a increase in interest rates would result in an immaterial amount of additional annual interest expense 
based on our debt level at december   anticipated cash flows from operations  and the various financial alternatives available to management  should there be an adverse change in interest rates  we do not believe that we have significant exposure to market risks associated with changing interest rates as of december  we do not use derivative financial instruments in our operations 
foreign currency risk prior to  our business has typically been transacted in the us dollar and  as such  has not been subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk 
however  with our acquisitions of operations in canada and the philippines during  we now have exposure to foreign currency fluctuations as well as other risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of income 
to the extent that the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions will result in increased net revenues and operating expenses 
conversely  our net revenues and operating expenses will decrease when the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies 
during  international revenues accounted for approximately of total revenues 
the majority of the international revenue was generated in the cayman islands and is us dollar based 
we are expanding our services to address our clients international operations and expect to conduct transactions on behalf of our clients in a number of geographies and currencies 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of shareholders equity 
in addition  we have certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
changes in the functional currency value of these assets and 
table of contents liabilities create fluctuations that will lead to a transaction gain or loss 
for the fiscal year ended december   we recorded a net foreign currency transaction gain of approximately  which is recorded in interest and other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
we may enter into hedges in the future to manage foreign currency risk  however  we did not have anything in place as of december
