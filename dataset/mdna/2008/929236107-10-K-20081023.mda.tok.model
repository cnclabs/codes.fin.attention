highlights consolidated net sales increased due to increases in europe and asia pacific of and  respectively  partially offset by a decrease of in the americas for the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year had a favorable impact on our net sales and net income 
the current fiscal year results translated at last fiscal year s exchange rates would have produced sales of million and net income of million 
thus  the impact of the change in foreign currency exchange rates year over year positively affected net sales and net income by million and million  respectively 
sales of multi purpose maintenance products increased  while sales of homecare and cleaning products decreased by for the current fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in multi purpose maintenance products for the current fiscal year was driven by growth and penetration in europe and asia pacific 
the categories in which our homecare and cleaning products are sold are very competitive by nature 
for fiscal year  sales of our homecare and cleaning products in the americas and europe were down and  respectively  versus the prior fiscal year as a result of lost or decreased distribution  category declines and temporary manufacturing disruptions 
the temporary manufacturing disruptions in the us  which occurred during the first half of the current fiscal year  resulted in lost sales of approximately million 
the decreases in the americas and europe were partially offset by an increase in sales of homecare and cleaning products in asia pacific of for fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 

table of contents sales in china increased for fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year as the region benefited from the development of direct sales activity  which began during fiscal year historically  the company s sales in china were through third party marketing distributors 
we plan to continue to increase our direct sales presence in china 
a significant challenge for the company continues to be the rising costs of components and raw materials 
in recent years  we have incurred continuing cost increases 
to combat the rise in costs  we have implemented price increases on certain products during each of the last three fiscal years  and we plan to implement further price increases throughout the world during fiscal year in addition to price increases  we continue to address the rising costs through innovation and margin enhancement strategies 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased during fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased employee related costs  outbound freight costs  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes  professional services costs and other miscellaneous costs 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded an impairment charge of million related to its x indefinite lived intangible asset 
the impairment charge was triggered by the decline in future forecasted sales levels of the x brand resulting from management s fourth quarter strategic decision to withdraw a number of products from the grocery trade channel 
during fiscal year  we acquired  shares of our common stock for a total cost of million to complete a share buy back plan that was approved by the company s board of directors in march results of operations fiscal year ended august  compared to fiscal year ended august  the following table summarizes operating data for our consolidated operations for the fiscal years ended august  and in thousands  except percentages and per share amounts fiscal year ended august  change from prior year dollars percent net sales multi purpose maintenance products homecare and cleaning products total net sales cost of products sold gross profit operating expenses income from operations net income earnings per common share diluted

sales for the fiscal year ended august  translated at exchange rates for the prior fiscal year would have produced sales of million in this region 
thus  the impact of the change in foreign currency exchange rates year over year positively affected sales for the fiscal year ended august  by approximately million  or 
sales of multi purpose maintenance products in the americas were essentially flat for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year due partially to decreased wd sales in the us  where sales declined 
wd sales in the us declined as customers reduced inventory levels and in store promotional activities in response to the slowing us economy 
in addition  due to supply constraints related to the distribution of the wd smart straw  promotional activities associated with the company s conversion to the smart straw format scheduled for late fiscal year were delayed until fiscal year the decrease in wd sales in the us was offset by increased wd sales in latin america and canada of and  respectively 
growth in latin america was primarily due to new distribution and increased promotional activity  while growth in canada was due to increased promotional activity during the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
sales of homecare and cleaning products in the americas for the fiscal year ended august  were down million  or  compared to the prior fiscal year due primarily to declines in the us where sales decreased across all homecare and cleaning product brands 
these declines were the result of several factors  including decreased distribution  declining categories  the effect of competitive factors and temporary manufacturing disruptions  the latter of which resulted in lost sales of over million 
spot shot sales declined in the us for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year due to reduced sales to key customers and overall declines in the aerosol spot and stain category 
the declines in the aerosol category were due to retailers reducing shelf space for aerosol spot and stain removers 
in 
table of contents an effort to offset these declines  we developed and recently launched environmentally friendly products such as spot shot instant carpet stain and odor eliminator and spot shot pet clean which are non toxic and biodegradable 
we are currently using the newer non toxic and biodegradable product offerings to both replace existing spot shot trigger product distribution and obtain additional new distribution where possible 
us sales of flushes and x automatic toilet bowl cleaners were down for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year due to decreased distribution with key customers  competitive innovation and temporary manufacturing disruptions  the latter of which resulted in lost sales of over million 
the decrease in distribution with key customers was the result of the continued decline in sales velocity of the in bowl products  as consumer trends have shifted toward the drop in and manual cleaning categories 
as a result  we have shifted our product line focus toward the drop in category 
overall  sales in the entire toilet bowl cleaning category have declined in the grocery trade channel  and we continue to face increased competition for shelf space 
as part of the category trend  our customers are consolidating this category while searching for new offerings that better satisfy consumers evolving needs 
to generate additional sales for the brand  we are focusing on enhancing our distribution in channels outside of the grocery trade  as well as developing new distribution channels for our automatic toilet bowl cleaning products 
us sales of x hard surface cleaners decreased for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year due primarily to lost distribution as a result of competitors activities 
also contributing to the sales declines were temporary manufacturing disruptions that resulted in lost sales totaling over million for the fiscal year ended august  in an effort to offset these losses and generate additional sales for the brand  we are focused on exploring new distribution channels that are less reliant on the grocery trade channel 
sales of carpet fresh in the us declined for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year due to reduced distribution and category declines in the mass retail and grocery trade channels 
in recent years  retailers have reduced shelf space for traditional rug and room deodorizers for reallocation to other air care products 
as a result  the rug and room deodorizer category as a whole has declined in the mass retail and grocery trade channels 
we continue to refine our marketing  promotions and pricing strategies to create new distribution opportunities for the carpet fresh brand 
sales of heavy duty hand cleaners for the americas decreased for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year due to reduced sales to key customers 
distribution remains consistent and stable through the grocery trade and other trade channels 
our us homecare and cleaning products compete in a highly competitive market and currently face diminishing product categories or shifts within these categories  as well as significant competitor activity 
we are addressing these challenges through our focus on innovation and the continued renovation of our homecare and cleaning product lines  in addition to new distribution channels 
our innovation and renovation efforts are focused on the areas of packaging enhancements  promotional strategies and new product offerings 
for the americas segment  of sales came from the us  and came from canada and latin america for the fiscal year ended august   similar to the distribution for the prior fiscal year when of sales came from the us and came from canada and latin america

the countries in europe where we sell through a direct sales force include the uk  spain  portugal  italy  france  germany  the netherlands  denmark and austria 
sales from these countries increased for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year and accounted for of the region s sales for the fiscal year ended august   down from in the prior fiscal year 
percentage increases in sales in us dollars across the various parts of the region for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year were as follows france   italy   the german sales region  and spain portugal  
we experienced a decrease in sales in the uk of for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year 
in the long term  the number of countries where we sell through a direct sales force is expected to increase  and these direct sales markets are expected to continue to be important contributors to the region s growth 
the sales growth in france was the result of the continued growth of the wd brand  including the wd smart straw  as well as increased distribution of the in one professional line of products 
the sales growth in italy was also the result of increased awareness and penetration of the wd brand and the continued growth of the wd smart straw 
the increased sales in the sales region which includes germany  the netherlands  denmark and austria were due to the continued growth and distribution of the wd smart straw and the further development of direct sales in the region compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in sales in spain portugal was due to the continued growth and penetration of the wd and in one brands 
the decrease in sales in the uk was due primarily to less promotional activity and increased competition related to the brand 
in the countries in which we sell through local distributors  sales increased for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year due primarily to the continued growth in eastern and northern europe and the middle east 
the distributor market accounted for approximately of the total europe segment sales for the fiscal year ended august  compared to for the prior fiscal year 
we expect these markets to continue to experience growth in distribution and usage resulting from increased market penetration and brand awareness

sales for the fiscal year ended august  translated at exchange rates for the prior fiscal year would have produced sales of million in this region 
thus  the impact of the change in foreign currency exchange rates year over year positively affected sales for the fiscal year ended august  by approximately million  or 
sales in australia increased for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to sales growth of wd and no vac 
sales of wd were up as a result of the continuing broad distribution of the brand across all trade channels  while also benefiting from account specific promotional activity with key customers 
no vac sales were up as a result of promotional activity as well as increased distribution as the brand continues to gain market share in australia s growing aerosol rug and room deodorizer category 
sales in asia increased for the fiscal year ended august  compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to increased wd sales to customers across the entire region  including china  indonesia  korea  taiwan and malaysia 
the increase in sales was the result of both increased promotional activity as well as the continued growth in awareness and penetration of the brand 
sales in china also benefited from the continued development of direct sales activity 
historically  we have sold to asia through third party marketing distributors 
however  to accelerate the growth in this region  we began direct operations in china during fiscal year sales across other parts of the asian region were also up  including in the philippines  japan  india and thailand 
this region represents long term growth potential for us 
operating items gross profit gross profit was million  or of sales in fiscal year  compared to million  or of net sales in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased by as we continued to experience increases in costs of products sold  which have negatively affected gross margins in all of our regions 
the rise in costs of products has been due to the significant increase in costs for components and raw materials  including aerosol cans and petroleum based products 
as a result of the general upward trend of costs in the market  we expect to experience a continuing rise in costs of components  raw materials and finished goods 
losses associated with vml  a related party contract manufacturer  also negatively impacted gross profit 
these losses were the result of manufacturing inefficiencies at vml and were recorded as a component of cost of products sold 
in response to these inefficiencies  the company obtained alternative manufacturers  who are expected to help improve the cost structure for some of the company s products 

table of contents in addition to rising costs and losses associated with vml  short term costs associated with product conversions and sourcing changes in the us also negatively impacted gross profit during fiscal year product conversions related to wd aerosol products and automatic toilet bowl cleaners resulted in obsolete packaging and other components that were expensed in cost of products sold 
we expect the additional sales and margin opportunities arising from the conversions and sourcing changes to far outweigh the short term costs of the conversions 
to combat the rise in costs discussed above  we have implemented price increases on certain products worldwide 
these price increases added approximately to our gross margin percentage for fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
however  this benefit was more than offset by the continued cost increases 
to further mitigate these cost increases  we will implement additional prices increases in fiscal year  and we will continue to focus on margin enhancement strategies 
in addition  we see gross margin enhancement opportunities through our innovation efforts 
in general  shifts in product and customer mix  as well as the timing of advertising  promotional and other discounts  which are recorded as a reduction to sales  may cause fluctuations in gross margin percentage from period to period 
examples of advertising  promotional and other discounts include coupon redemptions  consideration and allowances given to retailers for space in their stores  consideration and allowances given to obtain favorable display positions in retailers stores  co operative advertising and promotional activity  volume discounts and other one time or ongoing incentives 
during fiscal year  advertising  promotional and other discounts increased compared to the prior fiscal year  negatively impacting gross margin by 
the increase in such discounts was due to the fact that a greater percentage of sales during fiscal year was subject to promotional allowances due to the overall increase in promotional activity 
note that our gross margins may not be comparable to those of other reporting entities  since some entities include all costs related to distribution of their products in cost of products sold  whereas we exclude the portion associated with amounts paid to third parties for distribution to our customers and include these costs in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal year increased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in sg a expenses was largely attributable to increases in employee related costs  outbound freight costs  the impact of foreign currency translation  professional services costs  stock based compensation expense and other miscellaneous expenses 
employee related costs  which include salaries  profit sharing  bonus and other fringe benefits  increased million compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and fringe benefit expenses of million as a result of annual compensation increases and additional staffing to support the continued growth of international operations 
partially offsetting the increase in salaries and fringe benefit expenses was a decrease in the bonus accrual of million  as many regions achieved lower profit and other performance metrics for fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
outbound freight costs increased million due to the increase in sales as well as higher fuel costs 
the changes in foreign currency exchange rates year over year resulted in an increase in sg a expenses of million 
sg a expenses for fiscal year translated at last fiscal year s exchange rates would have produced total sg a expenses of million 
costs for professional services increased million primarily as a result of increased legal and information technology costs 
stock based compensation increased million due to the increased number of stock options and restricted stock units granted compared to the prior fiscal year 
in addition  other miscellaneous expenses increased million 
we continued our research and development investment in support of our focus on innovation and renovation 
research and development costs were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year our new product development team  team tomorrow  engages in consumer research  product development  current product improvement and testing activities 
this team leverages its development capabilities by partnering with a network of outside resources including the company s current and prospective outsource suppliers 

table of contents advertising and sales promotion expenses advertising and sales promotion expenses were million for fiscal year  down from million for the prior fiscal year and  as a percentage of net sales  decreased to for fiscal year from for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was related to the timing of investment in advertising activities for fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal year  the company invested in consumer broadcast and print media advertising to support the brand in the uk  but had lower levels of marketing investment in the us  as the company did not repeat its spot shot and wd no mess pen consumer broadcast advertising and print media  which the company invested in during the prior fiscal year 
we expect to increase our media investment during fiscal year  as we align our advertising and sales promotion activities with the distribution of our new and existing products 
as a percentage of net sales  advertising and sales promotion expenses may fluctuate period to period based upon the type of marketing activities employed by the company and the period in which the costs are incurred 
the costs of certain promotional activities are required to be recorded as reductions to sales  while others are classified as advertising and sales promotion expenses 
during fiscal year  total promotional costs recorded as reductions to sales were million versus million for the prior fiscal year 
therefore  our total investment in advertising and sales promotion activities totaled million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
amortization of intangible asset expense amortization of our intangible asset was million in each of fiscal years and  respectively 
the amortization relates to the non contractual customer relationships acquired in the acquisition by the europe segment in fiscal year this intangible asset is being amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated eight year life 
impairment of intangible assets due to the decline in future forecasted sales levels of the x brand resulting from management s fourth quarter strategic decision to withdraw a number of products from the grocery trade channel  the company performed an impairment test as of august   in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of the x indefinite lived intangible asset to its estimated fair value 
currently  the fair values of the carpet fresh and x brands approximate their carrying values  and the fair values of our other homecare and cleaning brands exceed their carrying values 
management has concluded that the carpet fresh and x brands may have a higher risk of impairment in future periods 
if the performance of these brands does not meet management s expectations in future periods  a future impairment could result for a portion or all of the company s indefinite lived intangible assets 
the company will continue to closely monitor events and circumstances that could further impair its indefinite lived intangible assets 
income from operations income from operations was million  or of net sales in fiscal year  compared to million  or of net sales in fiscal year the decrease in income from operations was due to the items discussed above

interest expense decreased due to the lower principal balance on long term borrowings resulting from the annual million principal payments made in october and the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by a decrease in interest income as a result of lower cash balances and interest rates during fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year 
other income  net other income  net increased by million for fiscal year compared to the prior fiscal year due primarily to increased foreign currency exchange gains in europe for the period 
other income  net also included rental income from vml 
the company owns and rents a warehouse facility to vml in memphis  tennessee 
vml serves as one of the company s contract manufacturers for certain homecare and cleaning products and acts as a warehouse distributor for other products of the company 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was of income before income taxes for fiscal year  an increase from for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the tax rate was primarily due to the one time benefits from favorable rulings on foreign tax matters and significantly higher non taxable interest income on municipal bond auction rate securities in the prior fiscal year 
these benefits were partially offset in the current fiscal year by the increased benefits of the internal revenue code section deduction related to qualified domestic production activities and lower foreign tax rates 
net income net income was million  or per common share on a fully diluted basis for fiscal year  compared to million  or per common share on a fully diluted basis for the prior fiscal year

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview in light of the recent liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets  we have further evaluated the company s financial position and identified steps we will take to maintain our strong financial health 
we believe the company is well positioned to weather the uncertainty in the global credit and capital markets due to our strong balance sheet  efficient business model and growing and diversified global revenues 
we are managing all aspects of our business including  but not limited to  monitoring the financial health of our customers  suppliers and other third party relationships  implementing margin enhancement strategies and seeking new opportunities for growth 
our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations and cash available from our million revolving credit facility  which was obtained in september at august   we had a total of million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents at august   the liquidity under our revolving credit facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet the projected operating and capital requirements for our current business plans 
we consider various factors when reviewing liquidity needs and plans for available cash on hand including future debt  principal and interest payments  early debt repayment penalties  future capital expenditure requirements  future dividend payments which are determined on a quarterly basis by the company s board of directors  alternative investment opportunities  loan covenants and any other relevant considerations currently facing our business

marketable securities periodically  we invest in interest bearing short term investments 
recently  some of these investments consisted of investment grade auction rate securities classified as available for sale and reported at fair value 
although these investments generally had stated maturities of months to years  this type of investment is designed to provide liquidity through an auction process that resets the applicable interest rates at predetermined periods ranging from to days 
this reset mechanism is intended to allow existing investors to continue to own their respective interest in the auction rate security or to gain immediate liquidity by selling their interests at par value 
as a result of the recent liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets  auctions for auction 
table of contents rate securities held by us failed during the second and third quarters of fiscal year however  we were able to liquidate our investment grade auction rate securities at par value through successful auctions at the end of may therefore  as of august   we did not carry any auction rate securities or other short term investments

critical accounting policies the company s results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
management uses historical experience and other relevant factors when developing estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated 
note to the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this report includes a discussion of significant accounting policies 
the accounting policies discussed below are the ones management considers critical to an understanding of the company s consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment 
the company s financial results may have been different if different assumptions had been used or other conditions had prevailed 
the company s critical accounting policies have been reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition sales are recognized as revenue at the time of delivery to the customer when risks of loss and title pass 
management must make judgments and certain assumptions in the determination of when delivery occurs 
through an analysis of end of period shipments  the company determines an average time of transit that is used to estimate the time of delivery 
differences in judgments or estimates  such as the lengthening or shortening of the estimated delivery time used  could result in material differences in the timing of revenue recognition 
sales are recorded net of allowances for damaged goods and other sales returns  sales incentives  trade promotions and cash discounts 
accounting for sales incentives the company records sales incentives as a reduction of sales in its consolidated statements of operations 
the company offers on going trade promotion programs with customers  and consumer coupon programs that require the company to estimate and accrue the expected costs of such programs

costs related to coupon offers are based upon historical redemption rates and are recorded as incurred  when coupons are circulated 
estimated sales incentives are calculated and recorded at the time related sales are made and are based primarily on historical rates and consideration of recent promotional activities 
the determination of sales incentive liabilities requires the company to use judgment for estimates that include current and past trade promotion spending patterns  status of trade promotional activities and the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category 
we review our assumptions and adjust our reserves quarterly 
our financial statements could be materially impacted if the actual promotion rates fluctuate from the estimated rate 
if the company s accrual estimates for sales incentives at august  were to differ by  the impact on net sales would be approximately million 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable

valuation of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets the carrying values of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we assess possible impairments at least annually during our second fiscal quarter and otherwise when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment condition may exist 
in addition  indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
the company s goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
first  the book value of the company s net assets is compared to the fair value of the net assets of the reporting units that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment 
in the second step  the implied fair value of goodwill is estimated as the fair value of the reporting unit used in the first step less the fair values of all other net tangible and intangible assets of the reporting unit 
any required impairment losses are recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and charged to results of operations 
the company s tests for impairment of intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are based primarily on a discounted cash flow approach that requires significant management judgment and estimates with respect to  among other considerations  forecasted sales revenue  advertising and promotional expenses  cost of products sold  gross margins  operating margins  the success of product innovations and introductions  customer retention  tax rates  terminal growth values and the selection of appropriate discount and royalty rates 
many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management  and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods 
these changes could result in future impairments 
for its indefinite lived intangible assets  an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount and is measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 

table of contents events and circumstances that we consider important which could trigger impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the company s strategy for its overall business or use of the acquired assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  decreased market capitalization relative to net book value  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities  loss of key distribution  change in consumer demand  loss of key personnel  and acts by government and courts 
during the second quarter of fiscal year  the company performed its annual review of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and determined that there were no instances of impairment 
as of august   the company performed additional tests of impairment of its indefinite lived intangible assets due to the decline in the future forecasted sales levels of the x brand resulting from management s fourth quarter strategic decision to withdraw a number of products from the grocery trade channel 
as a result  the company recorded impairment costs of million related to its indefinite lived intangible assets included in the americas segment 
currently  the fair values of the carpet fresh and x brands approximate their carrying values  and the fair values of our other homecare and cleaning brands exceed their carrying values 
management has concluded that the carpet fresh and x brands may have a higher risk of impairment in future periods 
if the performance of these brands does not meet management s expectations in future periods  a future impairment could result for a portion or all of the company s indefinite lived intangible assets 
the company will continue to closely monitor events and circumstances that could further impair its indefinite lived intangible assets
