critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a thorough understanding of our accounting policies is essential when reviewing our reported results of operations and our financial position 
our management considers the following accounting policies critical to an informed review of our consolidated financial statements

investments management determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the time of purchase and re evaluates such determination at each statement of financial condition date 
marketable securities classified as available for sale are primarily comprised of investments in our sponsored open end and closed end mutual funds as well as highly rated debt and preferred instruments 
these investments are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices  with unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we periodically review each individual security position that has an unrealized loss  or impairment  to determine if that impairment is other than temporary 
if we believe an impairment on a security position is other than temporary  the loss will be recognized in our audited consolidated statement of income 
impairments that arise from changes in interest rates and not credit quality are generally considered temporary 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of our investment in the net assets of an acquired company over the fair value of the underlying identifiable net assets at the date of acquisition 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the fair value to their carrying amounts 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their useful lives

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of our business  we are exposed to the risk of interest rate  securities market and general economic fluctuations which may have an adverse impact on the value of our marketable securities 
at december   approximately million was invested in our sponsored mutual funds 
we had approximately million invested in preferred equity securities  million invested in domestic fixed income and million invested in foreign and domestic equities as of december  in addition  a significant majority of our revenue approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively is derived from investment advisory agreements with our clients 
under these agreements  the investment advisory and administration fee we receive is based on the market value of the assets we manage 
accordingly  a decline in the prices of securities generally  and real estate securities in particular  may cause our revenue and income to decline by causing the value of the assets we manage to decrease  which would result in lower investment advisory and administration fees  or causing our clients to withdraw funds in favor of investments that they perceive as offering greater opportunity or lower risk  which would also result in lower investment advisory and administration fees 
in addition  market conditions may preclude us from increasing the assets we manage in closed end mutual funds 
the market conditions for these offerings may not be as favorable in the future  which could adversely impact our ability to grow the assets we manage and realize higher fee revenue associated with such growth 
as of december   of the assets we managed were concentrated in us real estate common stocks 
an increase in interest rates could have a negative impact on the valuation of reits and other securities in our clients portfolios  which could reduce our revenue 
in addition  an increase in interest rates could negatively impact our ability to increase open end mutual fund assets and to offer new mutual funds
