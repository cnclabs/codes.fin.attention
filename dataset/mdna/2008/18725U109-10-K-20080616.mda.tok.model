overview as a result of our growing portfolio of proprietary genetic biomarkers and the integration and re branding of the pgxhealth  cogenics and epidauros operations  we believe we are emerging as a global leader in the development and commercialization of predictive tests and targeted therapeutics that improve the efficacy and safety of drugs and genetic tests for complex and difficult to diagnose diseases and syndromes 
we are also a leading provider of genomic services to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
within pgxhealth  we are utilizing pharmacogenetics to develop predictive tests and safer and more efficacious therapeutics by advancing genetic markers to guide drug development and utilization 
we successfully completed our first phase iii clinical trial for vilazodone  our dual serotonergic compound in development for the treatment of depression and identified proprietary biomarkers of response for vilazodone 
in december  we initiated a long term safety study for vilazodone and a second confirmatory phase iii trial was initiated in march vilazodone vilazodone is a small molecule which is both an ssri and a hta partial agonist  thus combining in one molecule the current first line and a common second line therapy for depression 
our initial phase iii trial was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of vilazodone and to apply our expertise in pharmacogenetics to identify biomarkers that would form the foundation of a companion pharmacogenomic test for vilazodone response 

table of contents positive results of this clinical trial were released in september the drug met both its primary and related secondary efficacy endpoints 
as a result of this achievement  we made a million equity milestone payment to merck 
in addition  proprietary biomarkers of response for vilazodone were identified and patents for these biomarkers were filed 
we also exercised an option to license from merck the manufacturing rights of vilazodone for an equity payment of million in december and are proceeding with the manufacturing of the clinical and commercial drug supply in accordance with the applicable regulatory guidelines 
after the announcement of the study results in september and through the quarter ended december   we prepared and analyzed the data and  in december  we initiated a long term safety study 
the second phase iii study began in march  as previously communicated  these and the ongoing activities relating to vilazodone clinical and genetic development will lead to substantial increases in research and development expenses for pgxhealth over the next eighteen months 
these and additional studies are intended to support an nda for vilazodone with the fda  which could be accomplished as early as the end of calendar year with success  vilazodone would be an important proof of concept for us and an early example of a drug launched with the use of a companion pharmacogenetic test 
vilazodone would also be the first drug in the treatment for depression to target a segment of a population where mean response would be greater than that in the overall  unselected population of patients with depression 
while we believe the market potential of vilazodone is significant  funding the continued development of vilazodone is a challenge as phase iii and related studies and other requirements associated with an nda filing are expensive 
we were able to create significant shareholder value by completing the successful phase iii trial and biomarker identification without relinquishing economics to a third party prior to these findings 
with the public offering completed in july  we are better positioned to continue with the development of vilazodone  but currently do not have the cash reserves or the cash flow from other sources to fund such development through an nda submission 
in order to successfully commercialize this compound  we will likely enter into a partnership with a third party that has sufficient resources or be required to raise additional capital through the sale of equity and or debt securities 
establishing a partnership to develop and or commercialize vilazodone  may reduce financial and other burdens to us and enhance clinical and other co development efforts for vilazodone 
however  a partnership could have an impact on the future economics relating to the marketing of vilazodone and for our shareholders 
additionally  the sale of our equity and debt securities could serve to dilute our stockholders 
predictive tests pgxhealth also leverages its expertise and intellectual property to develop and commercialize predictive tests to aid in the prediction of drug response  as well as  to aid in diagnosis and management of complex clinical conditions 
we believe that advances in biomarker identification in the field of pharmacogenomics and in laboratory practices and testing platforms  and the manner in which we focus our development of our predictive tests  serve as a foundation for the adoption of predictive tests by providers and payers 
these tests are used to determine which individuals will experience enhanced benefit from specific therapies and may result in the reduction of therapeutic and medical costs as patients experience better clinical outcomes 
pgxhealth s mission is to leverage its expertise and intellectual property to facilitate market introduction and broad adoption of proprietary predictive tests and targeted therapeutics 
we currently provide five tests that are commercially available the familion tests associated with various cardiac channelopathies  including lqts  brs and cpvt mutations and our pgxpredict tests for warfarin and rituximab 
we also receive royalties for the sublicense of our intellectual property for tpmt 
with a portion of the proceeds we received from the public offering we completed in july  we have launched a provider focused sales force to drive test adoption with an initial focus on the familion tests 
we are currently refining the design of our first generation pgxpredict test for cia and as a result we have suspended marketing efforts in the near term 
we believe the new test will improve the value proposition for patients  providers and payers 
this has allowed our growing sales team to focus its efforts on near term opportunities for test adoption and revenue growth in the established sales channel 
we continue to apply our efforts and expertise to the development of new pharmacogenetic tests that predict drug response  focusing on disease states within the central nervous system psychiatry  cardiology  oncology and inflammatory diseases therapeutic areas 
we are also pursuing additional tests for complex and difficult to diagnose 
table of contents diseases and syndromes that will compliment our familion family of tests 
we have a robust pipeline of future tests and expect to launch up to three new tests in fiscal year we are also actively reviewing investment opportunities to acquire and advance intellectual property that will support test and therapeutic development  enhance and update infrastructure automation and information systems and other related initiatives 
these activities are required to reduce the cost of delivery and to increase laboratory capacity relating to delivery of our tests  enhance scalability of lab operations as demand grows for our tests  drive adoption of existing tests  commercialize new tests and enhance reimbursement for the tests  among other key metrics 
based on the current growth of the business and related product development  we expect this increased investment to remain at higher than normal levels through september  pgxhealth has also made significant progress in its ongoing efforts to contract with private and government health insurers for test coverage and reimbursement 
most recently  we announced that our familion test for lqts has met the bcbs tec s criteria for establishing the diagnosis of lqts in certain individuals 
in addition  as of the date of filing this form k with the sec  we have applied to be an approved laboratory provider to all state medicaid programs and have received approval in states 
in the remaining states  we continue to pursue medicaid through pending claims and contract negotiations 
we are a medicare provider and have made great strides in establishing positive coverage policies and in network contracts with private payers and direct hospital system and institution contracts 
genomic services our genomic services are marketed to the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  clinical  academic  government and agricultural markets through cogenics 
we believe that cogenics has earned a reputation as a leading provider of high quality genomic services in the us  europe and with certain clients with a global presence 
this reputation has enabled cogenics to obtain key contracts with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and academic institutions throughout the world 
our offerings are focused on enabling our customers to derive and study genomic data from biological sources 
we have developed a robust set of services  know how and informatics capabilities that enable our customers to identify genes and genetic variation  and to understand gene expression and function in plants  animals  humans and lower organisms 
we believe we provide one of the widest ranges of dna and rna related services in the outsourced genomic services industry 
our experience includes the completion of more than  clinical trial projects for a broad customer base that includes of the top pharmaceutical companies in the world 
we employ a field sales force in the us and europe to proactively market and sell cogenics services 
we can accept biological samples from customers located anywhere in the world with access to commercial shipping services  and we routinely deliver our products of data  analysis and interpretation through electronic communication channels 
in this way  we have coordinated genotyping for hundreds of multi site and multinational clinical trials 
our future success in genomic services will depend in large part on maintaining a competitive position in the evolving genomics field 
competition in this market is intense and includes larger and better financed pharmaceutical  biotechnology and diagnostic companies  academic and research institutions and government and other publicly funded agencies  both in the us and abroad 
new technologies are rapidly bringing the price of dna sequencing services down resulting in lower margins 
our future success in this highly competitive market depends on our ability to i demonstrate that our recently acquired technology platforms  know how  and informatics technologies and capabilities are superior to those of such competitors and ii continue to develop our technologies and genetic testing franchises 
in addition  we must continue to contain costs and move toward profitability while growing revenues and to build long term relationships with global and regional clients 
in january  we entered into a marketing agreement with affymetrix for a new drug metabolism service called the dmet early access solution 
cogenics and affymetrix worked closely with clients to develop the dmet technology  which directly assays  biomarkers in adme genes 
the kit includes cytochrome p enzymes and drug transporters including mdr  genetic biomarkers with which cogenics has extensive working experience and in some instances intellectual property 

table of contents financial operations overview revenue 
the majority of our revenue is from services related to fee for service arrangements or genetic and pharmacogenetic tests deliveries 
revenue for fee for service arrangements is recognized upon the later of service delivery or  if applicable  customer acceptance 
we maintain relationships with certain healthcare providers as well as healthcare insurance companies  revenue from these arrangements is recognized net of contractual allowances 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  including stock based compensation expense  laboratory expenses  depreciation  travel and facility costs 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries  commissions and other related personnel costs  including stock based compensation expense 
other costs primarily include advertising and promotion expenses  direct mailings  trade shows  facility costs and travel and related expenses 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with independent monitoring of our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials  fees paid to independent researchers  costs of contract manufacturing  services expenses incurred in developing and testing products and product candidates  salaries and related expenses for personnel  including stock based compensation expense  costs of materials  depreciation  rent  utilities and other facilities costs 
in addition  research and development expenses include the cost to in license technologies to support current development efforts 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel  including stock based compensation expense  in our executive  finance  accounting  information technology and human resource functions 
other costs primarily include facility costs and professional fees for accounting  consulting and legal services  including patent related expenses 
purchased research and development expense 
purchased research and development expense represents the value of the in process research and development projects at genaissance and icoria that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative use at their dates of acquisition in fiscal such costs were expensed in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the method and assumptions used to value the in process research and development 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest expense consists of interest incurred under notes payable and other debt financings and capital lease obligations 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
other income expense  net consists primarily of foreign currency gains losses 
changes in foreign currency rates a portion of our balance sheet is denominated in euros  the functional currency of our french and german operations  and british pounds  the functional currency of our united kingdom operations 
the effect of translation of these local currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the gains or losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense 
the euro strengthened against the us dollar by during fiscal and by during fiscal from the respective prior fiscal year s closing rates 
the results of our european operations can be significantly impacted by changes in these foreign exchange rates 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements and notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  allowances for doubtful accounts  intangibles  goodwill  accrued expenses and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for 
table of contents making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the majority of our current revenue is from services related to fee for service arrangements or genetic and pharmacogenetic tests deliveries 
revenue for fee for service arrangements is recognized upon the later of service delivery or  if applicable  customer acceptance 
we maintain relationships with certain healthcare providers as well as healthcare insurance companies  revenue from these arrangements is recognized net of contractual allowances 
revenue is also derived from fees for licenses of intellectual property  commercial partnerships and government contracts and grants 
revenue from commercial contracts are generally related to service fees  milestone achievements and deliveries of genomic data  diagnostic and genetic tests  and assays 
revenue from service fees and milestone achievements from commercial contracts is recognized based on the completed contract method 
to the extent payments received exceed revenue recognized for each contract or grant  the excess portion of such payments is recorded as deferred revenue 
if revenue recognized exceeds payments received for each contract  the excess revenue is recorded as accounts receivable 
revenue from government contracts and grants  which are typically cost plus arrangements  is recognized as revenues as related expenses are incurred over the term of each contract or grant 
revenue from arrangements with multiple deliverables is divided into separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met 
the consideration for the arrangement is then allocated to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
applicable revenue recognition criteria are then applied separately for each unit of accounting 
we defer recognition of revenue on multiple element arrangements if the fair values of all deliverables are not known or if customer acceptance is contingent on delivery of specified items or performance conditions 
because we often lack evidence of fair value for commercial partnership contracts  revenue is deferred until the contract is completed and all elements have been delivered 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances of   and  at march   and  respectively  are periodically reviewed  analyzing the customers payment history and information known to us regarding customers credit worthiness 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of intangibles as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we completed three business combinations during fiscal and one in fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  the transactions have been accounted for based on fair value 
as a result of the purchase price allocations  we recorded purchased intangibles totaling million and goodwill totaling million 
the fair value of the purchased intangibles was determined based on either discounted probable cash flows or replacement costs 
the interest rates used to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on our weighted average cost of capital ranging between and 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  we perform an annual impairment test of the carrying value of goodwill using december as our selected annual evaluation date 
the fair value of our recorded intangibles can be impacted by economic conditions  market risks  and the volatility in the markets in which we and our customers operate 
changes in fair value could result in future impairment charges if the fair value of the reporting units or asset groups to which these long lived assets are associated are determined to be less than the carrying value of such assets 
as of december   the most recent evaluation date  there was no impairment of such goodwill 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  when facts and circumstances suggest that there may be impairment  we will assess the carrying value 
table of contents of amortizing intangibles  including purchased intangibles 
when a potential impairment has been identified  forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the assets present in that operations 
if such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts  such intangibles are written down to their respective fair values 
the results of these periodic impairment tests can be impacted by our future expected operating results and cash flows  economic conditions  market risks  and the volatility in the markets in which we and our customers operate 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we assessed the recoverability of certain intangible assets acquired in the icoria transaction 
this assessment was conducted in connection with the development of our fiscal budget 
based on the projections for fiscal  we concluded that certain assets were impaired and recorded a million impairment during the year ended march  accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated cost incurred for such services as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include contract service fees  such as amounts paid to clinical monitors  data management organizations  clinical sites and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  and fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of materials for clinical and non clinical trials  and professional service fees 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
in the event that we do not identify costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date  on which specified services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services is often judgmental 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of inaccurate estimates  in part  by communicating with our service providers when other evidence of costs incurred is unavailable 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of march   we had federal tax net operating loss carryforwards  after limitation for the change in ownership  of million  which expire starting in  federal tax credit carryforwards of  and net deferred tax assets of million 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as an offset against these otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the realization of the tax benefit 
in the event that we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period in which such a determination is made 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas no 
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of this statement relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for us beginning on april  and should be applied prospectively  except in the case of a limited number of financial instruments that require retrospective application 
in february  the fasb deferred the implementation of sfas for certain non financial assets and liabilities  which will become effective for the company beginning on april  we are evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on the consolidated financial statements 
in february  fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas 
sfas no 
permits companies to elect  at specified election dates  to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value 
companies shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date  and recognize upfront costs and fees 
table of contents related to those items in earnings as incurred and not deferred 
sfas no 
becomes effective for us on april   and management did not elect to account for any financial assets or liabilities at fair value at adoption 
in july  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities eitf no 

eitf no 
clarifies the accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for research and development activities 
eitf no 
states that such payments should be capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or the services rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
eitf no 
is effective for us on april  we are currently evaluating the effect of eitf no 
on the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements  eitf no 

eitf no 
requires participants in a collaborative arrangement to report costs incurred and revenue generated from transactions with third parties in the income statement 
eitf no 
is effective for us beginning on april  we are currently evaluating the effect of eitf no 
on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r retains the fundamental requirements in sfas no 
that the acquisition method of accounting which sfas no 
called the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
sfas no 
r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
that replaces sfas no 
s cost allocation process  which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
sfas no 
r retains the guidance in sfas no 
for identifying and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas no 
r will now require acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred  restructuring costs associated with a business combination must generally be expensed prior to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
sfas no 
r applies prospectively to our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after april  results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenue 
revenue increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal excluding the impact associated with the wind down of icoria s grant revenue in december  which amounted to million in fiscal and million in fiscal revenues increased million  or  from million to million compared to same period a year ago 
pgxhealth revenue for the current year increased million  or  to million from million for the same period a year ago 
this increase was primarily driven by the increase in sales of pgxhealth s predictive tests of million  or  from the same period a year ago 
the introduction of pgxhealth s new commercial sales and marketing team in september has begun to have a notable impact on pgxhealth revenue for the last half of fiscal we expect to continue to expand and invest in the development of our pgxhealth sales force in an effort to continue the acceleration of revenue growth 
cogenics revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended march  from million for the year ended march  the increase in cogenics revenue is in part due to the inclusion of revenue of million since the date of the acquisition of epidauros on august  as well as an overall improvement within cogenics core service lines compared to the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in icoria s grant revenue of million from its agricultural product line  which ended in fiscal year excluding the impact of icoria grant revenue  cogenics revenue increased million  or to million for the year ended march  from million for the same period a year ago 
gross profit 
gross profit margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decline was primarily due to unusual infrastructure investments in overhead to meet increasing demand for our tests and lower margins from our gene sequencing services 
gross margins also declined as the domestic cogenics operations absorbed lab overhead costs previously offset by icoria grant revenue 
during fiscal  we initiated a program to 
table of contents significantly upgrade our technology platforms  laboratory information systems and other technologies to reduce the cost of production while increasing our capacity as our pgxhealth predictive test revenues grow 
we expect margins to improve as pgxhealth test volumes increase and the investments increase efficiencies in test production 
in addition  we continue aggressive activities to increase efficiencies and reduce costs in our cogenics units while allowing for expected growth in revenues 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is primarily related to a million equity payment made to merck associated with the successful completion of the vilazodone phase iii clinical trials and the initiation of the vilazodone phase iii confirmatory and safety trials 
during fiscal  we recorded a million equity milestone charge for manufacturing rights acquired from merck 
we expect our ongoing research and development costs to increase significantly as our vilazodone phase iii confirmatory and safety trials progress 
in addition  stock based compensation expense charged to research and development expense increased  for fiscal to  from  for fiscal sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the development of a new sales and marketing function within pgxhealth  including the hiring of a new sales force and senior level sales and marketing management  and increases in wages at cogenics 
while in fiscal we aggressively hired our sales force  we expect to continue at a slower rate to expand our pgxhealth sales force and therefore  continue to expect increases in expense in this area 
in addition  stock based compensation expense charged to sales and marketing expense increased  for fiscal to  from  for fiscal general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of the costs incurred by epidauros of million for the period beginning august  date of acquisition through march  as well as the increase in stock based compensation expense charged to general and administrative expense of million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal these increases were partially offset by savings realized as a result of cost reduction efforts taken in fiscal interest and other income expense  net interest expense decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal interest income increased million from  in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of the financing transaction completed in july for net proceeds of million  we are investing our cash not required to fund current operations in interest bearing assets 
other income expense  net decreased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal  which included a gain of approximately  related to the sale of an investment 
fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  fiscal includes the operations of pgxhealth and cogenics for a month period while fiscal includes their operations since their dates of acquisition only 
pgxhealth and cogenics are the surviving operations of the genaissance  icoria and genome express acquisitions in october  december and march  respectively 
revenues consolidated revenues increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase is principally due to the inclusion of a full year of operations in gross profit gross profit from services revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal due primarily to cost savings realized from integrating and streamlining the operations of genaissance and icoria 
research and development expense research and development expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the inclusion a full year of operations for the acquired businesses in  including approximately million related to the development of vilazodone of which approximately million of the development costs related to the merck equity milestone charge for the manufacturing rights to vilazodone 

table of contents sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the inclusion a full year of operations for the acquired businesses in as we integrate and build our sales and marketing function 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal approximately million of the increase was due to the inclusion of a full year of operations for the acquired businesses in within these businesses  the general and administrative expenses included million for the impairment of purchased intangible assets associated with our acquisition of icoria 
the adoption of fas r  effective april   increased general and administrative expenses by million 
purchased research and development expense purchased research and development expenses of million in fiscal represents the fair value of the in process research and development projects at genaissance of million and at icoria of million at their dates of acquisition 
since the costs relate to projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative use at their dates of acquisition  the costs were expensed in fiscal there were no such costs in fiscal interest and other income expense  net interest expense increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due primarily to the full year impact of the debt assumed in the acquisitions of genaissance and icoria 
interest income increased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due primarily to higher average investment balances  including net proceeds of million and million received from the private equity placements in june and november  respectively 
the increase in other income expense  net to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily represents a  gain on the sale of an investment recognized in fiscal preferred stock dividends preferred stock dividends of  and  in fiscal years and  respectively  represent dividends accrued on the series a preferred stock issued in connection with the acquisition of genaissance 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million at march  our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  are summarized in the following table in thousands year end march  in thousands cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate increase in cash and cash equivalents significant sources and uses of cash flows during the fiscal year ended march  were as follows in november  we sold electa lab for million 
in october  we sold vital scientific for million 
in august  we acquired epidauros for approximately million in cash 
in july  we sold approximately million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 

table of contents in june  we sold cdss for million 
based on the final balance sheet  the purchase price was reduced by million 
this amount was remitted to the buyer in november in june  we received million from the settlement of a breach of contract law suit filed against a third party 
our total debt obligations were million at march  all of which is associated with the million of debt obligations we assumed or incurred in connection with the acquisitions of genaissance  icoria  genome express and epidauros 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at march  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period fiscal fiscal through through after total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal in thousands contractual obligations short and long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations includes interest expense currently  we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we do not have any special purpose entities or other off balance sheet arrangements 
during fiscal  we made capital expenditures of approximately million primarily to introduce new products  improve production processing of existing and planned product offerings and to upgrade our laboratory information systems 
we expect to use our available cash and capital leases to fund these expenditures 
our sources of liquidity as of march  include our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of approximately million and possible future equity and or debt financings 
our projected uses of cash include cash used to fund operations  capital expenditures  existing debt service costs and continued research and product development and potential strategic acquisitions 
as of march   we held auction rate preferred securities  or arps  with a par value of million and a fair value of million 
the investments at march  consisted of preferred stock issued by closed end mutual funds  none of the auction rate securities in our portfolio are mortgage backed 
the most recent auctions for the arps in our investment portfolio failed 
our goal is to liquidate these securities as soon as possible  however  as a result of the failed auctions we continue to hold these securities and the issuers continue to pay interest at the maximum contractual rate 
based on current market conditions  it is likely that auctions related to these securities will be unsuccessful in the near term 
unsuccessful auctions will result in our holding these securities beyond their next scheduled auction reset dates  thus limiting the short term liquidity of these investments 
while these failures in the auction process have affected our ability to access these funds in the near term  we do not believe that the underlying securities or collateral have been adversely impacted 
we believe that the higher reset rates on failed auctions provide sufficient incentive for the security issuers to address this lack of liquidity 
we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity in these investments to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation 
we believe that our cash and cash availability will be sufficient to fund our operations through september we will need additional funds to continue development of vilazodone beyond september the sale of any equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain 
table of contents financing  the company may be required to reduce the scope and timing of the planned vilazodone nda filing  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates  changes in credit worthiness and liquidity of our marketable securities  as well as changes in foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar 
interest rate risk we use a combination of fixed rate term loans and fixed rate leases to finance our activities 
our term loans and leases are all at fixed rates over their lives and carry no interest rate risk 
foreign exchange the value of certain foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar may affect our financial results 
fluctuations in exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our revenues  gross margins  operating expenses  and retained earnings  all of which are expressed in us dollars 
auction rate preferred securities at march   we held auction rate preferred securities  or arps  with a par value of million and fair value of million 
the investments at march  consisted of preferred stock issued by closed end mutual funds  none of the auction rate securities in our portfolio are mortgage backed 
the most recent auctions for the arps in our investment portfolio failed 
our goal is to liquidate these securities as soon as possible  however  as a result of the failed auctions we continue to hold these securities and the issuers continue to pay interest at the maximum contractual rate 
based on current market conditions  it is likely that auctions related to these securities will be unsuccessful in the near term 
unsuccessful auctions will result in our holding these securities beyond their next scheduled auction reset dates  thus limiting the short term liquidity of these investments 
while these failures in the auction process have affected our ability to access these funds in the near term  we do not believe that the underlying securities or collateral have been adversely impacted 
we believe that the higher reset rates on failed auctions provide sufficient incentive for the security issuers to address this lack of liquidity 
an unrealized loss of  was recorded at march  to reflect the lack of liquidity in the ars 
if the credit rating of the security issuers deteriorates or the liquidity issues persist  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an impairment charge 
based on our ability to access our cash  our expected operating cash flows  and our available credit lines  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity in these investments to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation
