item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our business strategy 
products and services the following table presents net sales by category dollars in thousands year ended july  increase decrease ophthalmic neurosurgery oem codman  stryker and iridex other total ophthalmic and vitreoretinal surgical market various diseases of the eye  including trauma to the eye  can lead to a damaged retina 
conditions associated with retinal detachment often require surgical treatment to prevent vision loss 
these conditions include proliferative diabetic retinopathy  macular holes  macular puckers and traumatic eye injuries 
vitreoretinal surgery involves the removal of damaged tissue from the eye caused by disease or injury that interferes with normal vision 
this surgery is generally performed on the posterior portion of the eye surrounding the retina through incisions made near the front of the eye 
the retinal surgeon needs a variety of instruments and capital equipment to perform the surgery  such as a vitreous cutter to remove the vitreous from the eye  a light source and an illuminator to illuminate the eye  a laser and a laser probe which provides spot welding to reattach the retina or mitigate disease  and other microsurgical instruments including forceps  scissors and picks  many of which are offered by the company 
based upon a study performed for the company by market scope llc  there are approximately  practicing retinal specialists in the united states and an additional  throughout the rest of the world 
it is estimated that approximately  vitrectomies are performed each year in the united states and million vitrectomies are performed throughout the rest of the world 
the company initially engineered and produced prototype instruments designed to assist retinal surgeons in treating acute subretinal pathologies such as histoplasmosis and age related macular degeneration 
synergetics developed a number of specialized lines of finely engineered microsurgical instruments  which today have grown to comprise a product catalogue of over  retinal surgical items including scissors  fiberoptics  cannulas  forceps and other reusable and disposable surgical instruments 
during fiscal  the company introduced disposable forceps to be utilized on reusable handles 
these forceps and other instruments of this type have been widely accepted 

table of contents we are a leading supplier of and gauge instrumentation to the ophthalmic surgical market 
the larger gauge size remains the industry standard 
the and gauge microsurgical instruments enable surgeons to make smaller suture less incisions 
however  the use of these instruments limits the amount of light that can be delivered to the surgical field using traditional light sources 
as such  we engineered a system solution using smaller optical fibers that  in combination with other product functionality  are capable of efficiently delivering more light to the surgical field than traditional illumination systems 
at the same time  the device can deliver concentrated laser energy to the site to provide endophotocoagulation 
this technology was introduced to operating rooms across the world with synergetics release in july of our photon tm xenon light source for vitreoretinal illumination 
in addition to a high output light  the illuminator is also able to pass laser energy 
the light and laser energy are delivered coaxially to the surgical site through a single  ultra fine fiberoptic 
when used in conjunction with a laser  the ability of the photon tm to deliver both laser energy and vitreoretinal illumination through the same fiber line is unique  as is the number of accessories which can be attached to the device 
these features distinguish the photon tm from other xenon light sources in the marketplace 
we believe the photon tm will continue to gain acceptance in the ophthalmic surgical market as demand increases for  and finer gauge instrumentation used in connection with minimally invasive surgical techniques 
in september  the company announced that a new version of the photon tm had been designed  called the photon tm ii  which features an advanced illumination source that offers surgeons increased light output and a light spectrum that more closely matches the light response of the human retina 
these additional features offer surgeons up to two times the apparent light levels as compared to the photon tm 
however  the photon tm remains available for ophthalmic surgeons who prefer the xenon light 
in addition to producing our own ophthalmic and vitreoretinal surgical instruments and equipment  we entered into a three year distribution agreement in june with quantel 
this distribution agreement allows for the exclusive distribution by the company of quantel s vitra tm and supra tm lasers into ophthalmic operating rooms and distribution into the retina physicians offices 
the vitra tm and supra tm are portable lasers and are compatible with the photon tm and photon tm ii light sources 
the supra tm laser is scheduled to start shipping during our second fiscal quarter 
in september  we also entered into two new distribution agreements with volk  granting synergetics rights over the next three years to sell volk s products to vitreoretinal surgeons in the united states 
these agreements cover volk s line of ophthalmic lenses  used for detailed examination and treatment of the retina  and grant the company exclusive rights to sell volk s new optiflex surgical assistant and surgical lenses in the us this new vitreoretinal system  compatible with all leading surgical microscopes  enhances the surgeon s visual ability with precision focus and control 
our business continues to grow and evolve as new  minimally invasive surgical techniques are pioneered by leading vitreoretinal surgeons 
as microsurgical instruments become ever smaller  new endoillumination technology is required to assist surgeons in this field 
the company was an early developer of cutting edge endoillumination products and continues to be an innovation leader in the marketplace in the design  manufacture and marketing of laser probes and fiberoptic endoilluminators 
neurosurgery market there are over different types of brain tumors  and more than  adults and approximately  children diagnosed with brain tumors each year 
in addition to brain tumors  cerebral aneurysms  congenital malformations of the skull and vessels  excess fluid in the brain and other disorders  including those caused by trauma  can lead to neurosurgery 
neurosurgery is a medical specialty dealing with disorders of the brain  skull  spinal column  spinal cord  cranial and spinal nerves  the autonomic nervous system and the pituitary gland 
the neurosurgeon needs a variety of different hand held instruments and energy source devices to perform the surgery  such as operating microscopes  tissue fragmentation and suction devices  electrosurgical generators  and other instruments  many of which are offered by the company 

table of contents the company estimates that there are approximately  practicing neurological surgeons in the united states and an additional  throughout the rest of the world 
it is estimated that approximately  cranial procedures are performed each year in the united states  including over  craniotomies for tumor removal 
in addition  over million spine surgery procedures are performed annually in the united states and a total of over one million such procedures are performed worldwide by neurosurgeons and orthopedic surgeons 
the company has an integrated neurosurgical product line which includes the omni ultrasonic aspirator  a malis electrosurgical generator and precision neurosurgical instruments 
our neurosurgery product catalogue consists of over neurosurgical items including energy source devices  disposable and reusable instruments and other disposable items 
the primary use of the company s omni ultrasonic aspirator in neurosurgery is tumor removal 
the company distributes the omni control module  handpieces and accessory tips in the united states  canada  australia  new zealand  a portion of latin and south americas and all but two countries in europe  spain and portugal 
the control module and handpieces are manufactured by mutoh america co  ltd  a division of miwatec co  ltd 
the accessory tips are manufactured by the company 
the omni system uses ultrasonic waves to cause vibration of a tip that emulsifies bone and tissue for removal and then may utilize suction to aspirate these bone and tissue fragments 
the omni system is unique in its ability to cause the handpiece tip to oscillate torsionally allowing the surgeon to remove bone  a feature that is a safer alternative to a rotating drill in removing bone in or near critical anatomical structures in intracranial and spine surgery 
the tips and disposable packs are manufactured at the company s facility in o fallon  missouri 
in intracranial neurosurgery  a bipolar electrosurgical system is the modality of choice for tissue coagulation as compared to monopolar products 
the popularity of the bipolar system is largely due to the efforts of the late dr 
leonard i 
malis  who designed and developed the first commercial bipolar coagulator in and pioneered the use of bipolar electrosurgery for use in the brain 
the foundation of our bipolar electrosurgical system lies in our proprietary dualwave tm technology 
using this technology  our bipolar generators are able to deliver two separate waveforms to perform the two separate and distinct functions of cutting and coagulation 
with the virtual elimination of heat and electrical current spread  this technology  when used in accordance with the product instructions  can be used in direct contact with nerves  bones  blood vessels and metal implants  and we believe can be used in many areas of surgery 
our generators contain a rigidly stabilized voltage control to provide a controlled cut  using about one fifth the power of other generators 
in addition  the company has developed and released a line of bipolar instruments in both disposable and reusable formats  which will connect to all electrosurgical generators 
oem markets the company has three oem relationships  codman  stryker and iridex corporation iridex 
the loss of codman would have a material adverse effect on the company 

table of contents in the neurosurgery market  the bipolar electrosurgical system manufactured by valley forge prior to the merger has been marketed for over years through a series of distribution agreements with codman 
on january   the company executed a three year distribution agreement with codman for the continued distribution by codman of the third generation electrosurgical generator  certain other generators  related disposables and accessories 
in addition  the company entered into a three year license agreement  which provides for the continued licensing of the company s malis trademark to codman for use with certain codman products  including those covered by the distribution agreement 
both agreements expire on december  sales to codman in the fiscal year ended july  comprised approximately percent of sales 
the company supplies a lesion generator used for minimally invasive pain treatment to stryker pursuant to a supply and distribution agreement dated as of october  the original term of the agreement was for slightly over five years  commencing on november  and ending on december  on august   the company negotiated a one year extension to the agreement and increased the minimum purchase obligation to units per year for the remaining contract period 
the agreement covers the manufacture and supply of the lesion generator unit together with certain accessories 
the pain control unit can be utilized for facet denervation  rhizotomy  percutaneous chardotomy  dorsal root entry zone lesions  peripheral neuralgia  trigeminal neuralgia and ramus communications 
pain relief is achieved by the controlled heating of the area surrounding the electrode tip 
a thermosensor in the probe is used to control tissue temperature 
impedance values are displayed to guard against unsafe conditions 
the system provides an electrical stimulator for nerve localization and various coagulating outputs that are selectable based on the procedures undertaken 
the generator is configured for bipolar output to minimize current leakage  but is also capable of monopolar operation 
the agreement also provides stryker the right of first refusal for the distribution of certain other products in the pain control  orthopedic  ear  nose and throat ent  craniomaxillofacial  and head and neck surgery markets 
in addition  the company manufactures directional laser probes for iridex 
in october  iridex filed a lawsuit against the company for infringement of its patent no 
 entitled optical fiber with electrical encoding 
pursuant to a settlement of the lawsuit in  the parties entered into a manufacture and supply agreement in which the company obtained the right to manufacture and supply various laser probes to iridex 
manufacturing and supplies we design  manufacture and assemble the majority of our ophthalmic and certain of our neurosurgical products in our facility in o fallon  missouri 
the bipolar electrosurgical generators including the neurosurgery  pain control and other generator units are manufactured in philadelphia  pennsylvania and o fallon  missouri 
the omni ultrasonic aspirator  the vitra tm and supra tm laser units and the volk lenses and optiflex tm systems are manufactured by the respective parties 
our products are assembled from raw materials and components supplied to us by third parties 
most of the raw materials and components we use in the manufacture of our products are available from more than one supplier 
for some components there are relatively few alternate sources of supply 
however  we rely upon single source suppliers or contract manufacturers for a small portion of our disposable product line  for the production of our omni and for several key components of our photon tm light sources and our electrosurgical generators 
our profit margins and our ability to develop and deliver products on a timely basis may be adversely affected by the lack of alternative supply in the required timeframe 
in october  we completed a  square foot addition to our  square foot manufacturing facility and headquarters in o fallon  missouri 
in july  valley forge moved its philadelphia manufacturing  engineering and assembly facility and the oaks  pennsylvania selling  general and administrative offices into a new facility located in upper merion township  pennsylvania

government regulations the medical devices manufactured by us are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities  including federal  state and non us governmental agencies 
the principal regulator in the united states is the food and drug administration the fda 
fda regulations are wide ranging and govern the introduction of new medical devices  the observance of certain standards with respect to the design  manufacture  testing  labeling and promotion of devices  the maintenance and retention of certain records  the ability to track devices in distribution  the reporting of potential product defects and patient incidents  the export of devices and other matters 
all medical devices introduced into the market since  which include substantially all of our products  are required by the fda as a condition of sale and marketing to secure either a k premarket notification clearance or an approved premarket approval application pma 
a premarket notification clearance indicates fda agreement with an applicant s determination that the product for which clearance has been sought is substantially equivalent to another medical device that was on the market before or that has received k premarket notification clearance 
the process of obtaining a premarket notification clearance can take several months or years and may require the submission of limited clinical data and supporting information 
the pma process typically requires the submission of significant quantities of clinical data and manufacturing information and involves significant review costs 
under fda regulations  after a device receives k clearance  any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness  or that would constitute a major change in the intended use of the device  technology  materials or packaging  requires a new k clearance 
the fda requires a manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance  but the fda can review any such decision and  if it disagrees  it can require a manufacturer to obtain a new k clearance or it can seek enforcement action against the manufacturer 
we are also required to register with the fda as a device manufacturer and are required to maintain compliance with the fda s quality system regulations qsrs 
the qsrs incorporate the requirements of good manufacturing practice as well as other regulatory requirements of the fda  which mandate detailed quality assurance and record keeping procedures and subject us to unscheduled periodic quality system inspections 
we conduct internal quality assurance audits throughout the manufacturing process and believe we are in material compliance with all applicable government regulations 
we may not promote or advertise our products for uses not within the scope of our clearances or approvals or make unsupported safety or effectiveness claims 
further  we are required to comply with various fda requirements for labeling and promotion 
the medical device reporting regulations require that we provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence to reasonably suggest that one of our devices may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury 
in addition  the fda prohibits us from promoting a medical device before marketing clearance has been received or promoting a cleared device for unapproved indications 
noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action  which is more fully described in the risk factors section of this form k 

table of contents medical device regulations also are in effect in many of the countries outside the united states in which our products are sold 
these laws range from comprehensive device approval and quality system requirements for some or all of our medical device products to simpler requests for product data or certifications 
the number and scope of these requirements are increasing 
in june  the european union medical device directive became effective  and all medical devices sold in the european common market must meet the medical device directive standards 
the company sells its products in the european medical device market  as such  we have voluntarily chosen to subject ourselves to the audits established by the european union through which we have obtained ce marking for many of our products 
the company is subjected to annual audits at both of our manufacturing facilities for compliance to the quality system standards established by the international standards organization iso and medical device directives established by european law 
in december  we received certification for iso en iso en is an  international quality system standard that documents compliance to the european medical device directive 
in december  we were certified to iso  which replaced iso en as the international standard for quality systems as applied to medical devices 
in march  we were certified to iso  which replaced iso as the international standard for quality systems as applied to medical devices 
failure to correct deficiencies discovered during an audit could result in the removal of the ce mark on our products  which would effectively bar the sale of the company s products in the european market 
such a result would have a significant and material negative impact on the company and its business 
in addition  there are several other countries that require additional regulatory clearances 
management believes that we are in material compliance with the government regulations governing our business 
safety approvals the majority of our capital equipment products also require electrical safety testing  and in some cases electromagnetic compatibility testing  either as a product registration requirement and or to gain market acceptance 
intellectual property our ability to effectively compete in our product markets depends in part on developing  improving  and maintaining proprietary aspects of our technology platforms 
to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology  we rely on patents and patent applications  trade secrets  trademarks and know how 
patented and patent pending technology is used in most of our product lines  including our malis line of bipolar electrosurgical generators and accessories  our photon tm and lumen tm lines of illumination technology with complimentary accessories  our omni line of ultrasonic bone cutting tips  and various other reusable and disposable instruments 
currently  the company owns unexpired united states patents  the oldest of which issued in  and none of which will expire before we do not believe that the expiration of any one patent  or the expiration over time of all of our currently unexpired patents  will have a material  adverse effect on our business 
the company also has dozens of pending us patent applications  which we believe will  one day  issue as patents 
however  other companies and entities have filed patent applications or have obtained issued patents relating to instruments  laser probes  endoillumination  light sources  monopolar and bipolar electrosurgical methods and devices  any of which may impact our ability to obtain patents in the future 
when deemed appropriate for our business success  we will enforce and defend our patent rights 

table of contents we generally seek patent protection in the us on technological advancements used or likely to be used in our products and product improvements  and may seek patent protection on such technology in select other countries 
we do not  however  rely exclusively on our patents to provide us with competitive advantages with respect to our existing product lines 
we also rely upon trade secrets  know how  continuing technological innovations and superior engineering to develop and maintain our competitive advantage 
in an effort to protect our trade secrets  we generally require our consultants  advisors and employees to execute confidentiality agreements and  when appropriate  invention assignment agreements upon commencement of employment  or the consulting or advising relationship with us 
these agreements typically provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the subject person during the course of that person s relationship with us must be kept confidential and cannot be used  except in specified circumstances 
when appropriate  these agreements also contain provisions requiring these individuals to assign to us  without additional consideration  any inventions conceived or reduced to practice by the subject person while employed or retained by us  subject to customary exceptions

risk factors in addition to the other information contained in this form k  we have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
a significant part of our oem sales comes from a single customer  which makes us vulnerable to the loss of that customer 
codman currently accounts for most of our total revenue from sales of our bipolar electrosurgical generators 
during the fiscal year ended july  revenue from sales of our bipolar electrosurgical generators  cord tubing sets and royalty payments from codman represented approximately percent of the company s total net sales 
under our existing agreement with codman  codman distributes the third generation generator trademarked as the cmc tm iii on an exclusive basis 
our existing agreement with codman will expire by its own terms on december   unless extended by mutual agreement of the parties 
in order to continue to be an oem supplier to codman  we are designing new generators for them 
these new generators may require electrical safety testing before we begin manufacturing these new units 
our efforts to maintain a continuous supply to codman may not be sufficient depending on our unit sales of the cmc tm iii and the time required for redesign and subsequent approval 
if any of our single source suppliers were to cease providing components  we may not be able to produce our products 
we rely on a single source for the supply of the ultrasonic aspirators sold in the united states and internationally under the company s omni brand 
net sales of the company s omni ultrasonic aspirators for each of our fiscal years ended july  and amounted to greater than percent of total net sales for each period 
also  the manufacture of the company s photon tm light sources depends on single sources for several key components 
if any of these suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide products or components in the required volumes and quality levels or in a timely manner  we would be required to locate and contract with substitute suppliers 
although we believe that alternative sources for many of these components and raw materials are available  we could have difficulty identifying a substitute supplier in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms and may have to pay higher prices to obtain the necessary materials 
any supply interruption could harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified 
manufacturers of several parts used in our third generation bipolar electrosurgical generator models sold to codman under the cmc tm iii brand are no longer manufacturing these parts 
we believe we have arranged to purchase and maintain an adequate inventory of these parts 

table of contents the medical device industry is highly competitive  and we may be unable to compete effectively with other companies 
the medical technology industry is characterized by intense competition 
we compete with established medical technology companies and early stage companies that have alternative solutions for the markets we serve or intend to serve 
many of our competitors have access to greater financial  technical  research and development  marketing  manufacturing  sales  distribution services and other resources than we do 
furthermore  our competitors may be more effective at implementing their technologies to develop commercial products 
certain of the medical indications that can be treated by our devices can also be treated by other medical devices or by medical practices that do not include a device 
the medical community widely accepts many alternative treatments and certain of these other treatments have a long history of use 
our competitive position depends on our ability to achieve market acceptance for our products  develop new products  implement production and marketing plans  secure regulatory approval for products under development and protect our intellectual property 
we may need to develop new applications for our products to remain competitive 
technological advances  including pharmacology  by one or more of our current or future competitors could render our present or future products obsolete or uneconomical 
our future success depends upon our ability to compete effectively against current technology  as well as respond effectively to technological advances  and upon our ability to successfully implement our marketing strategies and execute our research and development plan 
our future results are dependent  in part  upon the successful market penetration of our fourth generation multifunctional bipolar electrosurgical generators under the malis trademark 
our future success  in part  is dependent upon the successful market penetration of our multifunctional bipolar electrosurgical generators and related instrumentation 
in fiscal  the sales of the malis generators and accessories represented approximately percent of the company s total revenue 
the success of these products in the marketplace is dependent upon several factors including their acceptance by surgeons  the recognition of hospitals and surgical centers that the new generator and instruments offer sufficient advantages and benefits to warrant the cost of purchasing one or more of the malis generators  our ability to create an effective distribution network  our ability to sustain our average selling price through this distribution network  and the reaction of our competitors in this market 
our products may not be accepted in the market 
we cannot be certain that our current products or any other products we may develop or market will achieve or maintain market acceptance 
we cannot be certain that our devices and the procedures they perform will be able to replace established treatments or that either physicians or the medical community in general will accept and utilize our devices or any other medical products that we may develop 
for example  we cannot be certain that the medical community will accept our multifunctional  electrosurgical generators and related instruments over traditional monopolar and existing bipolar electrosurgical generators and instruments 

table of contents market acceptance of our products depends on many factors  including our ability to convince third party distributors and customers that our technology is an attractive alternative to other technologies  manufacture products in sufficient quantities and at acceptable costs  and supply and service sufficient quantities of our products directly or through marketing alliances 
if we do not introduce new commercially successful products in a timely manner  our products may become obsolete over time  thereby decreasing our revenue and profitability 
demand for our products may change because of evolving customer needs  the introduction of new products and technologies  the discovery of cures for certain medical problems  including pharmacology  evolving surgical practices and evolving industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new commercially successful products and enhancements  our products may become obsolete over time  causing our sales and operating results to suffer 
the success of our new products will depend on several factors  including our ability to properly identify and anticipate customer needs  commercialize new products in a cost effective and timely manner  manufacture and deliver products in sufficient volumes on time  obtain regulatory approval for new products  differentiate our products from those of our competitors  achieve positive clinical outcomes  satisfy the increased demands by health care payors  providers and patients for lower cost procedures and shorter hospital stays and recovery times  innovate and develop new materials  product designs and surgical techniques  and provide adequate medical and or customer education relating to new products and attract key surgeons to advocate these new products 
new products and enhancements usually require a substantial investment in research and development before we can determine the viability of the product  and we may not have the financial resources necessary to fund this research and development 
moreover  new products and enhancements may not produce revenues in excess of the research and development costs  and they may become obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of new technologies or features 
failure to develop our manufacturing capability may mean that even if we develop promising new products  we may not be able to produce them profitably  as a result of delays and additional capital investment costs 

table of contents our operating results may fluctuate 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to fluctuate from time to time in the future 
some of the factors that may cause these fluctuations include  but are not limited to the introduction of new product lines  product modifications  the level of market acceptance of new products  the timing of research and development and other expenditures  timing of the receipt of orders from  and product shipments to  distributors and customers  timing of capital and other selling and general expenditures  changes in the distribution arrangements for our products  manufacturing or supply delays  the time needed to educate and train additional sales personnel  costs associated with product introductions  product returns  and receipt of necessary regulatory approvals 
changes in the health care industry may require us to decrease the selling price for our products or could result in a reduction in the size of the market for our products  each of which could have a negative impact on our financial performance 
trends toward managed care  health care cost containment and other changes in government and private sector initiatives in the united states and other countries in which we do business are placing increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost effective medical therapies that could adversely affect the sale or the prices of our products 
for example there has been a consolidation among health care facilities and purchasers of medical devices in the united states who prefer to limit the number of suppliers from whom they purchase medical products and these entities may decide to stop purchasing their products or demand discounts on our prices  major third party payors of hospital services  including medicare  medicaid and private health care insurers could substantially revise their payment methodologies or could impose reimbursement cutbacks that could create downward price pressure on our products  recently  there has been an fda provided incentive for surgeons to move certain procedures from hospitals to ambulatory surgical centers  which may impact the demand for and distribution of our surgical products  numerous legislative proposals have been considered that  if adopted  would result in major reforms in the united states health care system that could have an adverse effect on our business  
table of contents there is economic pressure to contain health care costs in international markets  and there have been initiatives by third party payors to challenge the prices charged for medical products that could affect our ability to sell products on a competitive basis 
both the pressures to reduce prices for our products in response to these trends and the decrease in the size of the market as a result of these trends could adversely affect our levels of revenues and profitability of our sales 
delays in the receipt or failure to receive clearances or approvals  the loss of previously received clearances or approvals  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects 
our research and development activities and the manufacturing  labeling  distribution and marketing of our existing and future products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies in the united states and in other countries 
the fda and comparable agencies in other countries impose mandatory procedures and standards for the conduct of clinical trials and the production and marketing of products for diagnostic and human therapeutic use 
products we have under development are subject to fda approval or clearance before marketing for commercial use 
the process of obtaining necessary fda approvals or clearances can take years  is expensive and the outcome may be uncertain 
our inability to obtain required regulatory approval or clearance on a timely or acceptable basis could harm our business 
further  approval or clearance may place substantial restrictions on the indications for which the product may be marketed or to whom it may be marketed 
additional studies may be required to gain approval or clearance for the use of a product for clinical indications other than those for which the product was initially approved or cleared or for significant changes to the product 
furthermore  another risk relates to the regulatory classification of new products or proposed new uses for existing products 
in the filing of each application  we are required to make a judgment about the appropriate form and content of the application 
if the fda disagrees with our judgment in any particular case and  for example  requires us to file a pma rather than allowing us to market for approved uses while we seek broader approvals or requires extensive additional clinical data  the time and expense required to obtain the approval might be significantly increased or approval might not be granted 
approved and cleared products are subject to continuing fda requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance  maintenance of records  reporting of adverse events and product recalls  documentation and labeling and promotion of medical devices 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain necessary clearances or approvals to market any other products  or existing products for new intended uses  on a timely basis  if at all 

table of contents we may be subject to penalties and may be precluded from marketing our products if we fail to comply with extensive governmental regulations 
the fda and non us regulatory authorities require that our products be manufactured according to rigorous standards 
these regulatory requirements may significantly increase our production costs and may even prevent us from making our products in amounts sufficient to meet market demand 
if we change our approved manufacturing process  the fda may need to review the process before it may be used 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements discussed throughout this annual report on form k could subject us to enforcement actions  including warning letters  fines  injunctions and civil penalties against us  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of our production  refusing our requests for premarket clearance or approval of new products  withdrawing product approvals already granted  and criminal prosecution 
federal  state and non us regulations  regarding the manufacture and sale of medical devices are subject to future changes 
the complexity  timeframes and costs associated with obtaining marketing clearances are unknown 
although we cannot predict the impact  if any  these changes might have on our business  the impact could be material 
we may be unable to maintain our iso certification or ce mark which allows us to sell our products in the european medical market 
pursuant to the medical device directive  the company is audited annually 
failure to correct deficiencies discovered during an audit could result in the removal of the ce mark on our products  which would effectively bar the sale of the company s products in the european market 
such a result would have a significant and material negative impact on the company and its business 
in addition  there are several other countries that require additional regulatory clearances we will first need to obtain electrical safety approval to market our applicable products under development 
the majority of our capital equipment products require electrical safety testing  and in some cases  electromagnetic compatibility testing  as either a product registration or to gain market acceptance 
the electrical safety testing and electromagnetic compatibility testing requirements may change and require us to redesign and retest our products 
the complexity  timeframes and costs associated with potential redesign and retesting are unknown 
required redesign and retesting could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our intellectual property rights may not provide meaningful commercial protection for our products  which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market 
our ability to compete effectively depends  in part  on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies and manufacturing processes  which includes the ability to obtain  protect and enforce patents on our technology and to protect our trade secrets 
we own patents that cover significant aspects of our products 
certain patents of ours have expired and others will expire in the future 
in addition  challenges may be made to our patents and  as a result  our patents could be narrowed  invalidated or rendered unenforceable 
competitors may develop products similar to ours that our patents do not cover 
in addition  our current and future patent applications may not result in the issuance of patents in the united states or other countries 
further  there is a substantial backlog of patent applications in the us patent and trademark office  and the approval or rejection of patent applications may take several years 
we may become subject to patent infringement claims or litigation or interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office to determine the priority of invention 

table of contents our competitive position depends  in part  upon unpatented trade secrets  which can be difficult to protect 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or gain access to our trade secrets 
in an effort to protect our trade secrets  we require consultants  advisors and most of our employees to execute confidentiality agreements and certain of them to sign invention assignment agreements upon commencement of employment or a consulting relationship with us 
these agreements typically provide that  except in specified circumstances  all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of his or her relationship with us must be kept confidential and cannot be used 
they typically contain provisions requiring these individuals to assign to us  without additional consideration  any inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by us  subject to customary exceptions 
some jurisdictions limit the enforceability and scope of these agreements and these agreements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of the unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information 
the medical device industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
numerous patents are held by others  including academic institutions and our competitors 
until recently  patent applications were maintained in secrecy in the united states until after the time the patent had been issued 
patent applications  filed in the united states after november generally will be published months after the filing date 
however  since patent applications continue to be maintained in secrecy for at least some period of time  we cannot assure you that our technology does not infringe any patents  patent applications held by third parties or prior patents 
we have  from time to time  been notified of  or have otherwise been made aware of  claims that we are infringing upon patents or other proprietary intellectual property owned by others 
if it appears necessary or desirable  we may seek licenses under such patents or proprietary intellectual property 
although patent holders may offer such licenses  licenses under such patents or intellectual property may not be offered or the terms of any offered licenses may not be reasonable 
any infringement claims  with or without merit  and regardless of whether we are successful on the merits  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel  cause shipment delays or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
an adverse determination could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may have product liability claims  and our insurance may not cover all claims 
the development  manufacture  sale and use of medical products entail significant risk of product liability claims 
we maintain product liability coverage at levels we have determined are reasonable 
we cannot assure you that such coverage limits are adequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur in connection with the development  manufacture  sale or use of our products 
in addition  we may require increased product liability coverage as our sales increase in their current applications and new applications 
product liability insurance is expensive and in the future may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could adversely affect our business 
the loss of key personnel could harm our business 
our future success depends upon the continued service of key management  technical sales and other critical personnel  including messrs 
gampp  malis and dallam and ms 
boone  our chief operating officer  chief scientific officer  executive vice president of sales and marketing and chief financial officer  respectively 
we maintain key person life insurance for messrs 
gampp and malis 
with the exception of ms 
boone  our officers and other key personnel are employees at will  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain them 
the loss of any key employee could result in a disruption to our operations and could materially harm our business 
in addition  the integration of replacement personnel could be time consuming  may cause additional disruptions to our operations  and may be unsuccessful

if we are unable to hire  train and retain additional sales  marketing  manufacturing  engineering and finance personnel  our growth could be impaired 
to grow our business successfully and maintain a high level of quality  we will need to recruit  retain and motivate highly skilled sales  marketing  engineering  manufacturing and finance personnel 
if we are not able to hire  train  and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  our growth may be impaired 
in particular  we will need to expand our sales and marketing organizations in order to increase market awareness of our products and to increase revenues 
in addition  as a company focused on the development of complex products  we will need to hire additional engineering staff of various experience levels in order to meet our product development strategy 
competition for skilled employees is intense 
we plan to expand our international sales and distribution operations  and the success of our international expansion is subject to significant uncertainties 
we believe that we must expand our international sales and distribution operations to have continued growth 
in fiscal  our sales to countries outside the us represent percent of our total sales 
we expect to sell an increasing portion of our products to customers overseas 
in attempting to conduct and expand business internationally  we are exposed to various risks that could adversely affect our international operations and  consequently  our operating results  including difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  including imposition of currency exchange controls  longer accounts receivable collection cycles  import or export licensing requirements  potentially adverse tax consequences  political and economic instability  obtaining regulatory approval for our products  end market and or regional competition that may have competitive advantages  
table of contents potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights  and subjectivity of other countries laws 
we have international suppliers of various products  including the omni ultrasonic aspirator console and handpieces 
we have suppliers that are located outside the united states  subjecting us to risks generally associated with contracting with non us suppliers  including quality concerns  adverse changes in other countries economic conditions  import regulations  duties  tariffs  quotas  economic and political instability  burdens of complying with a wide variety of other countries laws and embargoes 
our reliance on international suppliers may cause us to experience problems in the timeliness and the adequacy or quality of product deliveries 
additionally  and specifically in regard to the omni console and handpieces  there is an additional risk as our contract with the equipment manufacturer is year to year 
our cash and lines of credit facilities are maintained with a regional bank which given the current financial crisis may not be fully insured or available 
we maintain significant amounts of cash and cash equivalents at a financial institution that is in excess of federally insured limits 
given the current instability of financial institutions  we cannot be assured that we will not experience losses on these deposits 
in addition  in the current environment  we can not be assured that the company s million revolving credit facility  million non us receivables credit facility  or the million equipment line of credit will be available for borrowing  or that the company will be able to replace the revolving credit facility upon its expiration on december  the market price of our stock may be highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock could fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors  including our ability to successfully commercialize our products  the execution of new agreements and material changes in our relationships with companies with whom we contract  quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  announcements regarding technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors or the results of regulatory filings  market reaction to trends in sales  marketing and research and development and reaction to acquisitions  sales of common stock by existing shareholders  changes in key personnel  economic and political conditions  including worldwide geopolitical events  and fluctuations in the united states financial markets 

table of contents synergetics usa has anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition and could adversely affect the price of its common stock 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in the control of our management  including transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices 
in addition  these provisions may limit the ability of our shareholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interest 
also  our board of directors is divided into three classes  as nearly equal in size as practicable  with three year staggered terms 
this provision may deter a potential acquirer from engaging in a transaction with us because it will be unable to gain control of our board of directors until at least two annual meetings have been held in which directors are elected by our shareholders 
material increases in interest rates could potentially be a detriment to sales 
many of our products are sold to non us distributorships which purchase our products via funds secured through assorted financing arrangements with third party financial institutions  including credit facilities and short term loans 
increased interest rates would ultimately increase the overall cost of owning our products for the end user and  thereby  reduce product demand 
because we do not require training for users of our products  and sell our products to non physicians  there exists an increased potential for misuse of our products  which could harm our reputation and our business 
federal regulations restrict the sale of our products to or on the order of licensed practitioners 
the definition of licensed practitioners varies from state to state 
as a result  our products may be purchased or operated by physicians with varying levels of training  and in many states by non physicians  including nurse practitioners and technicians 
outside the united states  many jurisdictions do not require specific qualifications or training for purchasers or operators of our products 
we do not supervise the procedures performed with our products  nor do we require that direct medical supervision occur 
we  and our distributors  generally offer but do not require purchasers or operators of our products to attend training sessions 
in addition  we sometimes sell our systems to companies that rent our systems to third parties and that provide a technician to perform the procedure 
the lack of training and the purchase and use of our products by non physicians may result in product misuse and adverse treatment outcomes  which could harm our reputation and expose us to costly product liability litigation 
if our facilities were to experience catastrophic loss  our operations would be seriously harmed 
our facilities could be subject to catastrophic loss such as fire  flood  tornados or earthquake 
all of our research and development activities  manufacturing  our corporate headquarters and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults in o fallon  missouri 
any such loss at any of our facilities could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue and result in large expense to repair and replace our facilities

defendants filed counterclaims alleging tortious interference with business relationships 
the counterclaims were transferred to new jersey and subsequently dismissed without prejudice 
after a full trial on synergetics claims  the jury found in synergetics favor 
on december   the court entered a judgment awarding synergetics  in compensatory damages against defendants   in punitive damages against each of hurst and mcgowan  and  for litigation costs 
the court also granted synergetics certain injunctive relief against defendants 
after appeal by defendants  the eighth circuit court of appeals affirmed the judgment in all respects 
subsequently  on motion of defendants to vacate the judgment  the trial court issued an order denying defendants motion  and awarding defendants  as a sanction against synergetics  in effect reducing by half the damages originally awarded to the company 
defendant s again appealed

this suit is captioned synergetics usa  inc v 
alcon laboratories  inc 
and alcon  inc  case no 
civ the company s attorneys in this matter have agreed to represent the company on a contingency fee basis 
in the complaint  the company alleges that alcon has used its monopoly power in the market for vitrectomy machines to control its customers purchasing decisions in favor of alcon s surgical illumination sources and associated accessories  such as by tying sales of its light pipes to sales of its patented fluid collection cassettes  which are required for each vitreoretinal surgery using alcon s market dominant vitrectomy machine 
the complaint describes further anti competitive behaviors  which include commercial disparagement of the company s products  payment of grant monies to surgeons  hospitals and clinics in order to influence purchasing decisions  the maintenance of a large surgeon advisory board  many of the surgeons on which receive benefits far beyond their advisory contributions and are required to buy alcon s products  predatory pricing  an unlawful rebate program  and a threat to further lock out the company from an associated market unless granted a license to use some of our key patented technologies 
the company requested both monetary damages and injunctive relief 
on june   alcon filed a pleading responsive to the complaint  denying all counts  asserting affirmative defenses  and stating a counterclaim in which alcon alleges that the company misappropriated trade secrets from infinitech  a company acquired by alcon in at present  deadlines for pre trial activities in this suit are scheduled through january

cv y  alleging infringement of united states patent no 
 as such patent is amended by the reexamination certificate issued july  alcon research  ltd 
has requested enhanced damages based on an allegation of willful infringement  and has requested an injunction to stop the alleged acts of infringement 
because the complaint fails to identify a single product as infringing  at this stage the company is left to guess at the basis for the suit 
aggregate sales revenue of products which may have any similarity with the referenced patent was approximately  for the last six fiscal years 
the company expects to raise meritorious defenses to the infringement suit 
in addition  from time to time we may become subject to litigation claims that may greatly exceed our product liability insurance limits 
an adverse outcome of such litigation may adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity

through continuous improvement and development of our people  our mission is to design  manufacture and market innovative microsurgical instruments and consumables of the highest quality in order to assist and enable microsurgeons around the world to provide a better quality of life for their patients 
the company s primary focus is on the microsurgical disciplines of ophthalmology and neurosurgery 
our distribution channels include a combination of direct and independent sales organizations and important strategic alliances with market leaders 
the company s product lines focus upon precision engineered  microsurgical  hand held instruments and the microscopic delivery of laser energy  ultrasound  electrosurgery  illumination and irrigation  often delivered in multiple combinations 
enterprise wide information is included in note to the consolidated audited financial statements 
during fiscal  the company decided to redirect the efforts formally placed on the ent market back into neurosurgery 
new product sales the company s business strategy has been  and is expected to continue to be  the development  manufacture and marketing of new technologies for micro surgery applications including the ophthalmic and neurosurgical markets 
new products  which management defines as products first available for sale within the prior month period  accounted for approximately percent of total sales for the company for fiscal  or approximately million 
for fiscal  new products accounted for approximately percent of total sales for the company  or approximately million 
this continued growth was primarily in our capital equipment products both in the ophthalmic and neurosurgery markets 
synergetics past revenue growth has been closely aligned with the adoption by surgeons of new technologies introduced by synergetics 
since august   synergetics has introduced new items to the ophthalmic and neurosurgery markets 
we expect adoption rates for the company s new products in the future to have a similar effect on its operating performance 

table of contents growth in minimally invasive surgery procedures minimally invasive surgery is surgery performed without making a major incision or opening 
minimally invasive surgery generally results in less patient trauma  decreased likelihood of complications related to the incision and a shorter recovery time 
a growing number of surgical procedures are performed using minimally invasive techniques  creating a multi billion dollar market for the specialized devices used in the procedures 
based on our micro instrumentation capability  we believe we are ideally positioned to take advantage of this growing market 
the company has developed scissors having a single activating shaft as small as gauge inch  millimeter in diameter 
we also believe that we are the world leader in small fiber illumination technology as our photon tm and photon tm ii light sources can transmit more light through a fiber of micron diameter or smaller than any other light source in the world 
this product was developed for ophthalmology but has wide ranging minimally invasive surgical applications 
the company s malis line of electrosurgical bipolar generators is the market share leader in neurosurgical generators worldwide 
these generators produce a unique and patented waveform that has been developed and refined over many decades and has proven to cause less collateral tissue damage as compared to other competing generators 
the omni power ultrasound system technology provides a new method for the minimally invasive removal of soft and fibrotic tissue  as well as bone removal 
this technology is in its infancy  and we anticipate that  once fully developed  it will become a standard of care in multiple minimally invasive surgical applications 
the company has benefited from the overall growth in this market and expects to continue to benefit as it continues to introduce new and improved technologies targeting this market 
demand trends increased procedure volume  product mix improvements and price contributed to the majority of sales growth for the company during the fiscal years ended july   and ophthalmic and neurosurgical procedures volume on a global basis continues to rise at an estimated percent growth rate driven by an aging global population  new technologies  advances in surgical techniques and a growing global market resulting from ongoing improvements in healthcare delivery in third world countries  among other factors 
in addition  the demand for high quality products and new technologies  such as the company s innovative instruments and disposables  to support growth in procedures volume continues to positively impact growth 
the company believes innovative surgical approaches will continue to significantly impact the ophthalmic and neurosurgery market 
pricing trends through its strategy of delivering new and higher quality technologies  the company has generally been able to maintain the average selling prices for its products in the face of downward pressure in the healthcare industry 
however  increased competition in the market for the advantage tm electrosurgical generator has negatively impacted the company s selling prices on these devices 
further economic conditions may be negatively impacting the company s selling prices for the omni ultrasonic aspirator 

table of contents our business strategy our goal is to become a global leader through continuous improvement and development of our people  continuous improvement and development of our manufacturing facilities  continuous improvement of our systems  and continuous improvement of our research and development initiatives 
during july  the company realigned its field sales operations 
the realignment is designed to position the company to attain increased revenues and market share 
a comprehensive study of the company s sales and marketing structure was undertaken  and as a result  a new and improved sales training system is being developed  higher recruitment standards are being implemented  individual and corporate objectives were linked with changes to the compensation structures and a defined sales process has been initiated 
during august  the company has begun to introduce lean manufacturing philosophies into the production environment 
these philosophies were applied to our largest volume disposable product family where we were able to cut manufacturing times in half and reduce scrap by one third 
we plan to continue to apply the lean philosophy to one value stream at a time according to the financial importance to the company 
we will also be applying this philosophy to other departments in our organization  including purchasing  accounting and administration

revenue from licenses  extended warranty contracts and royalty fees is recorded when earned 

table of contents inventories inventories  consisting of purchased materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  with cost being determined using the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
the company s inventory is very dynamic and new products are added frequently 
thus  the company reviews the valuation of its inventory on a quarterly basis and determines if a valuation allowance is necessary for items that have not had their values updated recently 
in addition  the company evaluates inventories for excess quantities and identified obsolescence quarterly 
the company s evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand  as well as estimates of quantities required to support warranty and other repairs 
to the extent that it determines there are some excess quantities based on its projected levels of sales and other requirements  or obsolete material in inventory  it records valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related parts or products 
if future cost valuations  future demand or market conditions are different from the company s projections  a change in recorded inventory valuation reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
amortization periods the company records amortization of intangible assets using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of these assets 
it bases the determination of these useful lives on the period over which it expects the related assets to contribute to its cash flows or in the case of patents  their legal life  whichever is shorter 
if the company s assessment of the useful lives of intangible assets changes  it may change future amortization expense see impairment of long lived assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors

salaries  benefits and other direct costs of product development are expensed as operating expenses in research and development costs 
patents are amortized to operations under the straight line method over the remaining statutory life of the patent 
goodwill and other intangibles absent any impairment indicators  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis 
the company has performed its impairment tests during the fourth fiscal quarter 
management analyzed the valuation of our valley forge acquisition by utilizing current business operations and a market multiple method 
based on this analysis  we believe the enterprise value of our acquisition continues to be greater than our investment 
as a result  we have determined that no impairment of our goodwill has occurred 
while the annual impairment tests did not indicate goodwill impairment  we would be subject to future impairment if the operating results and cash flows of our valley forge acquisition would not support the fair value of the reporting unit s net assets including goodwill 
intangible assets  consisting of patents  licensing agreements and proprietary know how are amortized to operations under the straight line method over their estimated useful lives or statutory lives whichever is shorter 
these periods range from two to seventeen years 
the life of a trademark is inextricably related to the life of the product bearing the mark or the life of the business entity owning the trademark 
the company intends to use the trademark indefinitely  and therefore  its useful life is not limited to any specific product 
the trademark constitutes an indefinite lived intangible that will be used in perpetuity 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the group of assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
deferred tax assets and liabilities the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse

and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense was recognized if the exercise price of the company s employee stock options equaled or exceeded the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant 
under sfas r  compensation expense is now recognized 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the directors and employees requisite service period 
compensation expense is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
of the inputs into the black scholes option pricing model  the one that can impact the value of the options the most is the volatility factor 
the company has utilized a volatility factor of percent in this calculation 
in addition  the company utilized an expected average risk free interest rate of percent  an expected average life of years and no expected dividends 
the company has elected to use the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  an entity uses the fair value based accounting method for all employee awards granted  modified or settled after the effective date 
as of the effective date  compensation costs related to the nonvested portion of awards outstanding as of that date are based on the grant date fair value of those awards as calculated under the original provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  that is  an entity would not remeasure the grant date fair value estimate of the unvested portion of awards granted prior to the effective date of sfas r

the other revolving credit facility had no outstanding balance at july  balances on this credit facility bear interest at the bank s prime lending rate 
the equipment line of credit facility had no outstanding balance at july   bearing interest at an effective interest rate at the prime rate 
interest expense from these credit facilities is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
assuming the current levels of borrowings at variable rates and a two percentage point increase in the average interest rate on these borrowings  it is estimated that our interest expense would have increased by approximately  the company does not perform any interest rate hedging activities related to these three facilities 

table of contents additionally  the company has exposure to non us currency fluctuations through export sales to international accounts 
as only approximately percent of our sales revenue is denominated in non us currencies  we estimate that a change in the relative strength of the dollar to non us currencies would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations 
the company does not conduct any hedging activities related to non us currency
