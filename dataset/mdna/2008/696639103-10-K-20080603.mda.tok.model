table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are one of the nation s leading manufacturers and marketers of factory built homes 
we market nationwide through vertically integrated operations  encompassing manufactured and modular housing  financing and insurance 
as of march   we operated manufacturing facilities that sell homes through company owned retail sales centers and builder locations and approximately independent retail dealers  builders and developers 
through our subsidiary  countryplace  we currently offer conforming mortgages to purchasers of factory built homes sold by company owned retail sales centers and certain independent retail dealers  builders and developers 
the loans originated through countryplace are either held for our own investment portfolio  sold to investors  or included as part of securitized financing transactions 
we also provide property and casualty insurance for owners of manufactured homes through our subsidiary  standard casualty 
the tightening of credit standards  limited retail and wholesale financing availability  increased levels of repossessions  excessive retail inventory levels and manufacturing capacities caused the manufactured housing industry to enter a cyclical downturn in mid our fiscal results were heavily influenced by these difficult industry conditions 
industry shipments have continued to decline with calendar year manufactured housing shipments down from calendar year and the three significant to both us and the industry manufactured housing states of florida  california and arizona down a combined and comprising of the total national decline in shipments 
industry modular shipments are down for calendar year as compared to calendar year modular sales accounted for approximately of our revenues in fiscal while average selling prices of modular homes were higher in fiscal  unit sales were down due to weaker housing demand trends 
the severe downturn of the overall housing market created by a return to more prudent lending practices has produced excess site built inventory which is directly competitive with modular housing 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we closed our sabina  ohio  casa grande  arizona and one of our plant city  florida manufacturing facilities as well as under performing retail sales centers to more effectively align our manufacturing capacity and distribution channels with current and expected regional demand 
in connection with these actions  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million primarily related to facility closure costs 
of this million  million is included in cost of sales and million is included in selling  general and administrative expenses on our consolidated statement of operations 
also  as part of this restructuring  we listed three of our manufacturing facilities for sale 
we expect to sell these facilities during fiscal the carrying value of these facilities is included in assets held for sale on the consolidated balance sheets 
no significant additional charges are expected to be incurred in connection with this restructuring 
the deterioration of the credit markets that we depend on for warehouse lending for originations and securitizations of our loans has also impacted our business during fiscal countryplace s warehouse borrowing facility was originally scheduled to expire march   however  they negotiated an extension with the lender until april  during the extension period  countryplace stopped taking applications for chattel loans and non conforming mortgages but continued to originate conforming mortgage loans 
on april   countryplace sold approximately million of its warehoused portfolio of chattel and mortgage loans without incurring a loss 
approximately million of the proceeds were used to repay in full and terminate the warehouse borrowing facility scheduled to expire on april  countryplace will continue to originate and service conforming mortgages for our credit worthy customers 
with these difficult market conditions worsening and no near term signs of recovery for the factory built housing industry  we have focused on executing three key strategies to improve our operating results 
first  the company plans to increase revenues through an expanded product offering including the less expensive manufactured and modular products introduced during the first quarter of fiscal  enhanced marketing and advertising efforts  and expanded distribution channels 
along with this  we will continue to identify ways to 
table of contents reduce our fixed costs and improve operating efficiencies 
we will also focus on cash generation and conservation throughout our operations 
in addition  we have amended certain debt agreements subsequent to march  see liquidity and capital resources section for further details 
results of operations the following table sets forth the items in our statements of operations as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended march  march  march  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses goodwill impairment income loss from operations interest expense equity in earnings loss of limited partnership and impairment charges interest income and other income loss before income taxes income tax benefit expense net income loss the following table summarizes certain key sales statistics as of and for the period indicated

fiscal years and were comprised of weeks while fiscal year was comprised of weeks 
the additional week in fiscal is immaterial for separate discussion in the income statement categories below 
compared to net sales 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease is primarily the result of a million decrease in factory built housing net sales offset by a million increase in financial services net revenues 
the decline in factory built housing net sales is primarily due to a decrease in the total number of factory built homes sold and decreases in the average retail and 
table of contents wholesale selling prices of new manufactured homes offset by an increase in the average retail selling price of a new modular home 
the decrease in the total number of factory built homes sold is largely due to a decrease in the homes sold to independent dealers  builders and developers  the majority of which related to shipments to the states of florida  california and arizona  which prior to were typically some of our most profitable states see executive overview section above for more details 
these states have been especially impacted by decreased manufactured home sales to manufactured housing retirement communities 
the decrease in the average retail and wholesale selling prices of new manufactured homes is the result of our new lower priced products 
the increase in the average selling prices of a new modular home is the result of customers purchasing larger modular homes 
the increase in financial services net revenues primarily reflects an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in consumer loans receivable as of march  as compared march  gross profit 
in fiscal  gross profit decreased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales in fiscal gross profit for the factory built housing segment decreased to of net sales in fiscal from in fiscal factory built housing gross profit for fiscal includes million in restructuring charges related to closing under performing sales centers and less than efficient plants and for fiscal includes million in restructuring charges related to closing sales centers and plants in fiscal excluding these charges  gross profit for the factory built housing segment would have been in fiscal and in fiscal this decrease was the result of a decline in the factory utilization rates coupled with continued pressure on our manufactured housing wholesale margins in florida  california and arizona and offset by an increase in the internalization rate from in fiscal to in fiscal gross profit for the financial services segment increased million in fiscal primarily due to increased interest income as explained above in the net sales section 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal of this million decrease  million related to the factory built housing segment and was offset by a million increase in financial services general corporate expenses were essentially flat with the prior year 
factory built housing expenses include million in charges related to closing under performing sales centers and less than efficient plants in fiscal and million in restructuring charges related to closing sales centers and plants in fiscal excluding these charges  selling  general and administrative expenses for the factory built housing segment decreased million 
this decrease is largely the result of the cost savings steps we put in place during fiscal plus a reduction in performance based compensation costs and operating fewer manufacturing facilities and sales centers 
selling  general and administrative expenses related to the financial services segment increased due to a million one time performance based compensation payment 
the payment was based on countryplace profitability from inception through goodwill impairment 
goodwill impairment was million for fiscal due to the difficult market environment  particularly the recent fallout in the sub prime market  and our recent losses  we determined that an interim test to assess the recoverability of goodwill was necessary 
with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  we performed an interim goodwill impairment analysis and concluded that the goodwill relating to our factory built housing reporting unit was impaired 
as a result  during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to our factory built housing segment goodwill balance 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as a result of the completion of countryplace s second securitization in march  our interest expense on securitized financings increased million and was offset by a million decrease in interest expense on our warehouse revolving debt 
also  interest expense on floor plan payable increased million 
the interest rate on the warehouse revolving debt and the floor plan payable is variable 

table of contents equity in loss of limited partnership and impairment charges 
equity in loss of limited partnership and impairment charges was zero in fiscal as compared to a million loss in fiscal the million loss in fiscal includes the write off of our investment in bsm of million effective september  on may   we executed an agreement to terminate our partnership with bsm effective june  under the termination agreement  we have no further financial obligation to bsm 
interest income and other 
interest income and other decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the million decrease was primarily the result of a million decrease in interest and dividend income and a million impairment charge on investment securities in fiscal the impairment on investment securities related to the write down of an other than temporary loss on an available for sale investment security 
interest income in was also impacted by reduced rates of return 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax expense was million in fiscal as compared to a benefit of million in fiscal due to the difficult market environment  particularly the recent fallout in the sub prime market  and our recent losses  we reviewed the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  we recorded a million valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets resulting in income tax expense for fiscal of million 
in fiscal  we recorded a million benefit on our loss before income taxes of million 
compared to net sales 
net sales decreased to million in fiscal from in fiscal this million decrease in net sales is comprised of a million decrease in factory built housing net sales offset by a million increase in financial services net sales 
the decrease in factory built housing net sales is the result of million  or homes  sold to fema in fiscal and a decrease in the number of factory built homes sold excluding fema business offset by an increase in the average selling prices of new manufactured and modular homes 
the decrease in total factory built homes excluding fema business is largely due to a decrease in demand for hud code homes in florida  california and arizona  which are typically some of our most profitable states see executive overview section above for more details 
the average retail selling price of a new manufactured home increased and a new modular home increased while the average wholesale selling price of a new manufactured home increased and a new modular home increased 
these increases in average selling prices are the result of customers purchasing larger  more complex homes 
the increase in financial services net sales of million reflects an increase in interest income resulting from an increase in consumer loans receivable  net from million as of march  to million as of march  gross profit 
in fiscal  gross profit decreased to million  or of net sales  from million  or of net sales 
gross profit for the factory built housing segment decreased from of net sales in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease is partially due to million in charges related to closing under performing sales centers and less than efficient plants in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal excluding these charges  gross profit for the factory built housing segment would have been 
the reduction in retail and wholesale deliveries in florida  california and arizona also contributed to the decrease in factory built housing gross profit 
gross profit for the financial services segment increased million to of net sales in fiscal  up slightly from of net sales in fiscal this increase is due to the increase in net sales as explained above 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal in dollars  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal of this million decrease  million related to the factory built housing segment and was offset by increases in general corporate expenses of million and increases in financial services expenses of million 
factory built housing expenses also include million in charges related to closing under performing sales centers and less than efficient plants in the second and fourth quarters of fiscal 
table of contents excluding these charges  selling  general and administrative expenses for the factory built housing segment decreased million 
this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in performance based compensation costs  a reduction of manufacturing facilities and sales centers at march  as compared to march  as well as our ongoing cost savings efforts 
the increase in general corporate expenses is due primarily to increases in advertising costs and various other administrative expenses 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this was primarily due to a million increase in interest expense on the warehouse revolving debt  a million increase in interest expense on the securitized financing and a million increase in interest expense on floor plan payable 
both the interest rates on the warehouse revolving debt and the floor plan payable are variable 
impairment of limited partnership and equity in earnings loss of limited partnership 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we filed a petition for dissolution of our partnership with bsm 
the investment in bsm of million as of september was written off effective september  effective may   we have reached an agreement with bsm to terminate the partnership 
as part of the agreement  we have both agreed to mutual releases of all prior claims  counterclaims and causes of action 
we have not recorded any equity in bsm s earnings losses since the second quarter when we wrote off our investment 
interest income and other 
interest income and other remained relatively flat at million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal interest income and other decreased primarily due to million earned on a real estate investment in fiscal and was offset by a million increase in interest and dividend income and a million gain on the sale of available for sale investments in fiscal income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit is million in fiscal as compared to expense of million in fiscal this is the result of a pretax loss of million in fiscal versus pretax earnings of million in fiscal the effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents totaled million at march   down from million at march  net cash used in operating activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the million decrease in cash used is primarily due to changes in net cash used to originate consumer loans for investment and is offset by changes in trade receivables  restricted cash and accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this million increase is due to million of insurance proceeds received for the property  plant and equipment at our burleson facility which was destroyed by a fire  a million decrease in net cash related to purchasing and selling investment securities and a million payment to the minority interest holders of countryplace to purchase the remaining of the company 
these increases are offset by a million decrease in net purchases of property  plant and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal of this million decrease  million is the result of us receiving proceeds from a securitization in offset by a million increase in proceeds from warehouse revolving debt and floor plan payable 
we have an agreement with a financial institution for a million floor plan facility expiring march  the advance rate for the facility is of manufacturer s invoice 
this facility is used to finance a portion of the new home inventory at our retail sales centers and is secured by new home inventory and a portion of receivables from financial institutions 
the interest rate on the facility is prime at march  plus or prime plus to for aged units  of which we have none financed as of march  in 
table of contents may  the agreement was amended to revise the covenants which must be maintained in order for us to borrow against the facility 
the amended covenants require us to comply with a loan to collateral value  as defined  of and minimum liquidity amount  as defined  of million 
as of march   the loan to collateral value  as reported  was and  therefore  we were not in compliance with the covenant 
if either of the covenants are not met  we must then comply with minimum inventory turns of  tangible net worth of million and operating cash flow of negative million 
as of march   the tangible net worth  as reported  was million and  therefore  we were not in compliance with the covenant 
we received a waiver for non compliance through march  and executed an amendment to the agreement effective june  the amendment extends the agreement to march   changes interest rate to libor plus and alters certain covenant levels loan to collateral value is increased to for quarter one of fiscal and is gradually reduced to by fiscal year end  tangible net worth is reduced to million for quarter one of fiscal and is gradually increased to by fiscal year end  and fiscal operating cash flow is increased to million 
we had million and million outstanding under these floor plan credit facilities at march  and march   respectively 
on may   we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due the notes in a private  unregistered offering 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in may and november 
on june   the initial purchaser of the notes exercised its option to purchase an additional million aggregate principal amount of the notes 
on september   for the benefit of the note holders  the company filed a shelf registration statement covering resales of the notes and the shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of the notes 
the notes are senior  unsecured obligations and rank equal in right of payment to all of our existing and future unsecured and senior indebtedness 
the note holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash on may   may  and may  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
each  in principal amount of the notes is convertible  at the option of the holder  at a conversion price of  or shares of our common stock upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and contingencies 
for fiscal years  and  the effect of converting the senior notes to  shares of common stock was anti dilutive  and  therefore  was not considered in determining diluted earnings per share 
on july   we  through countryplace  completed our initial securitization for approximately million of loans  which was funded by issuing bonds totaling approximately million 
the bonds were issued in four different classes class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  and class a totaling million with a coupon rate of 
maturity of the bonds is at varying dates beginning in through and were issued with an expected weighted average maturity of years 
the proceeds from the securitization were used to repay approximately million of borrowings on our warehouse revolving debt with the remaining proceeds being used for general corporate purposes  including future origination of new loans 
for accounting purposes  this transaction was structured as a securitized borrowing 
on march   we  through countryplace  completed our second securitization for approximately million of loans including approximately million of pre funded loans to be originated in the future which was funded by issuing bonds totaling approximately million 
the bonds were issued in four classes class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  class a totaling million with a coupon rate of  and class a totaling million with a coupon rate of 
maturity of the bonds is at varying dates beginning in through and were issued with an expected weighted average maturity of years 
the proceeds from the securitization were used to repay approximately million of borrowings on our warehouse revolving debt with the remaining proceeds being used for general corporate purposes  including future origination of new loans 
for accounting purposes  this transaction was also structured as a securitized borrowing 

table of contents countryplace had an agreement with a financial institution for a million warehouse borrowing facility to fund loans originated by countryplace 
the facility was collateralized by specific consumer loans receivable pledged to the facility 
the advance against the outstanding principle balance of eligible consumer loan receivables was and draws could be made at an advance rate against land home loans in various stages of completion 
the advance rates were subject to market value adjustments 
the interest rate was libor at march  plus 
countryplace had outstanding borrowings under the warehouse facility of million as of march  and million as of march  the facility was originally scheduled to expire march   however  countryplace negotiated an extension with the lender until april  during the extension period  the interest rate was increased to libor plus and the advance rate  affected for market value adjustments  was reduced to 
countryplace stopped taking applications for chattel and non conforming mortgage loans but continued to originate conforming mortgage loans during the extension period 
on april   countryplace sold approximately million of its warehoused portfolio of chattel and mortgage loans 
approximately million of the proceeds were used to repay in full and terminate the warehouse borrowing facility scheduled to expire on april  countryplace is currently considering alternatives for short term and long term financing of its loan portfolio  including construction financing for mortgage loans 
until such financing is arranged  we will continue to advance funds to countryplace 
upon completion of the securitization  countryplace extinguished its interest rate swap agreement on its variable rate debt which was used to hedge against an increase in variable interest rates 
countryplace recorded the hedge instrument at fair value as of the end of each fiscal quarter with the effective offsetting portion of the hedge being recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  and the ineffective portion  if any  of the hedge being recorded in our consolidated statement of operations 
upon extinguishment of the hedge  countryplace recorded a loss of million  net of tax  for the change in fair value to other comprehensive income loss  which is amortized to interest expense over the life of the loans 
there was no significant ineffectiveness 
countryplace currently intends to originate conforming mortgage loans for sale to fannie mae and other investors 
countryplace plans to retain the associated servicing rights 
in addition  countryplace plans to continue holding its remaining portfolio of chattel  non conforming mortgages for investment on a long term basis 
countryplace makes loans to borrowers that it believes are credit worthy based on its credit guidelines 
however  originating and holding loans for investment subjects countryplace to more credit and interest rate risk than originating loans for resale 
the ability of customers to repay their loans may be affected by a number of factors and if customers do not repay their loans  the profitability and cash flow of the loan portfolio would be adversely affected and we may incur additional loan losses 
at present  asset backed and mortgage backed securitization markets are effectively closed to countryplace and other manufactured housing lenders  and no assurances can be made that a securitization or other term financing market will be available to countryplace in the future 
at such time in the future that any securitization or other term financing market re emerges  countryplace intends to resume originating chattel and non conforming mortgages for its investment portfolio 
while we believe countryplace will be able to obtain liquidity through sales of conforming mortgages to fannie mae and other investors  no assurances can be made that these investors will continue to purchase loans secured by manufactured homes  or that countryplace will successfully complete transactions on acceptable terms and conditions  if at all 
we believe that the proceeds from floor plan financing  conforming mortgage sales  and any other available borrowing alternatives will be adequate to support our working capital needs  and currently planned capital expenditure needs for the foreseeable future 
however  we intend to focus on cash generation and conservation through our operations to help support these cash needs as well 
because future cash flows and the availability of financing will depend on a number of factors  including prevailing economic and financial conditions  business  credit market conditions  and other factors beyond our control  no assurances can be given in this regard 

table of contents contractual obligations dollars in thousands the following tables summarize our contractual obligations  including interest  at march  for additional information related to these obligations  see the notes to consolidated financial statements 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years floor plan payable debt obligations warehouse revolving debt convertible senior notes securitized financing securitized financing repurchase obligations letters of credit operating lease obligations total contractual obligations interest is calculated by applying contractual interest rates to fiscal year end balances 
we have contingent repurchase obligations outstanding at march  which have a finite life but are replaced as we continue to sell our factory built homes to dealers under repurchase agreements with financial institutions 
we did not incur any losses related to these contingent repurchase obligations during fiscal  and we have provided letters of credit to providers of certain of our insurance policies 
while the current letters of credit have a finite life  they are subject to renewal at different amounts based on the requirements of the insurance carriers 
we have recorded insurance expense based on anticipated losses related to these policies as is customary in the industry 
the note holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash on may   may  and may  at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
the warehouse revolving debt facility was repaid in full and terminated in april  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
impairment of intangible assets goodwill and other long lived assets 
in assessing the recoverability of our intangible assets and other long lived assets on an annual basis  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
due to the difficult market environment  particularly the recent fallout in the sub prime market  and the continued decline in shipments to florida  california and arizona  and our recent losses  we determined that an interim test to assess goodwill for impairment was necessary 
with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  we completed this analysis in the second quarter of fiscal 
table of contents in analyzing the potential impairment of goodwill  sfas no 
prescribes a two step process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting units 
if the results of the first step indicate that impairment potentially exists  the second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
impairment is determined to exist when the estimated fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
for the first step  in accordance with sfas no 
and with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  we estimated the fair value of our factory built housing reporting unit utilizing the estimated present values of future cash flows of the reporting unit  and other market based assessments of fair value for the reporting unit 
based on the results of the first step of the analysis  we concluded that the fair value of our factory built housing reporting unit was less than its carrying value and  accordingly  that the second step of the analysis was necessary to determine the amount of goodwill impairment 
for the second step  in accordance with sfas no 
and with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  we allocated the estimated fair value of our factory built housing reporting unit to various assets and liabilities to determine the fair value of its goodwill 
this process primarily involved estimating the difference between the carrying value and fair value of our property  plant and equipment  intangibles and inventories 
based on the results of the second step of our analysis  we concluded the goodwill relating to our factory built housing reporting unit was fully impaired 
as a result  in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to our factory built housing segment goodwill balance 
recovery of deferred tax asset 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized prior to expiration  we are required to establish a valuation allowance against that portion of our deferred tax assets 
the determination of valuation allowances involves significant management judgment and is based upon the evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  including our best estimates of anticipated taxable profits in the various jurisdictions with which the deferred tax assets are associated 
changes in events or expectations could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances and material changes to our provision for income taxes 
as a result of the continued difficult market environment  particularly the recent fallout in the sub prime market  and our losses for the cumulative three year historical period  we reviewed our deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance was necessary 
after considering both positive and negative evidence  based primarily upon our recent losses  we recognized a million valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets which resulted in us recording an income tax provision of approximately million for fiscal if  after future considerations of positive and negative evidence related to the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  we determine a lesser allowance is required  we would record a reduction to income tax expense and the valuation allowance in the period of such determination 
revenue recognition 
retail sales of manufactured homes and certain single story modular homes  including shipping charges  are recognized when a down payment is received  the customer enters into a legally binding sales contract  title has transferred and the home is accepted by the customer  delivered and permanently located at the customer s site 
additionally  for retail sales of all multi story modular homes  nationwide modular homes  and manufactured homes in which we serve as the general contractor with respect to virtually all aspects of the sale and construction process  sales are not recognized until after final consumer closing 
transportation costs  unless borne by the retail customer or independent retailer  are included in the cost of sales 
warranties 
we provide the retail homebuyer a one year limited warranty covering defects in material or workmanship in home structure  plumbing and electrical systems 
we record a liability for estimated future warranty costs relating to homes sold  based upon our assessment of historical experience factors 
factors we use in the estimation of the warranty liability include historical warranty experience related to the actual number of calls and the average cost per call 
although we maintain reserves for such claims based on our assessments as described above  which to date have been adequate  there can be no assurance that warranty expense levels will 
table of contents remain at current levels or that such reserves will continue to be adequate 
a large number of warranty claims exceeding our current warranty expense levels could have a material effect on our results of operations and liquidity 
transfers of financial assets 
countryplace has completed two securitizations of manufactured housing loan receivables since the second quarter of fiscal the securitizations were accounted for as financings  which use the portfolio method of accounting in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  where loan contracts are securitized and accounted for as borrowings  interest income is recorded over the life of the loans using the interest method  the loan contracts receivable and the securitization debt asset backed certificates remain on countryplace s balance sheet  and the related interest margin is reflected in the income statement 
this accounting has been utilized since july   the date of issue of the company s initial securitized financing 
the securitizations include provisions for removal of accounts by countryplace that preclude sale accounting of the securitizations under sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
the structure of countryplace s securitizations have no effect on the ultimate amount of profit and cash flow recognized over the life of the loan contracts  except to the extent of surety fees and premiums  trustee fees  backup servicer fees  and securitization issuance costs 
however  the structure does affect the timing of cash receipts 
countryplace services the loan contracts under pooling and servicing agreements with the securitization trusts 
countryplace also retains interests in subordinate classes of securitization bonds that provide over collateralization credit enhancement to senior certificate holders and are subject to risk of loss of interest payments and principal 
as is common in securitizations  countryplace is also liable for customary representations 
we guarantee certain aspects of countryplace s performance as the servicer under the securitization pooling and servicing agreement 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses reflects countryplace s judgment of the probable loss exposure on their loan portfolio as of the end of the reporting period 
countryplace s loan portfolio is comprised of loans related primarily to factory built palm harbor homes 
the allowance for loan losses is developed at a portfolio level and not allocated to specific individual loans or to impaired loans 
a range of probable losses is calculated after giving consideration to  among other things  the composition of the loan portfolio  including historical loss experience by static pool  expected probable losses based on industry knowledge of losses for a given range of borrower credit scores  the composition of the portfolio by credit score and seasoning  and recent loss experience 
countryplace then makes a determination of the best estimate within the range of loan losses 
the accrual of interest is discontinued when either principal or interest is more than days past due 
in addition  loans are placed on nonaccrual status when there is a clear indication that the borrower has the inability or unwillingness to meet payments as they become due 
payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied first to accrued interest and then to principal 
impaired loans  or portions thereof  are charged off when deemed uncollectible 
as of march   countryplace management was not aware of any potential problem loans that would have a material effect on loan delinquency or charge offs 
delinquency performance for loans receivable in california  florida and arizona suggests the effects of declining house prices in these states in general has had no discernable effect to date on performance of countryplace s loans receivable portfolio 
there were no accounts in arizona past due or more days as of march  the delinquency rate for california chattel loans is comprised of a single loan with a receivable balance of  representing less than of the total loans receivable portfolio 
although the delinquency rate of florida land home loans receivable is almost triple the rate of the total portfolio  this delinquency is comprised entirely of three loans with total loans receivable balance of  these three florida loans represent less than of the total loans receivable portfolio 
delinquency performances for texas remain well within the average delinquency rates of the total portfolio 

table of contents recent deteriorating performance of mortgage loans in general in these states has been driven  in large part  by product features such as adjustable rates  interest only payments  payment options  etc 
that have a high propensity to induce payment shock or negative equity  and underwriting practices which relied on the expectation of continuous house price 
countryplace s underwriting practices and risk management policies have been based on an assumption that the manufactured home collateral would depreciate  rather than appreciate  in value over the life of the loan 
accordingly  its credit standards are based on both the borrowers capacity to repay the loan as scheduled  and the borrowers history of satisfying repayment obligations 
as a result  countryplace management believes the portfolio is less susceptible to defaults due to adjustable interest rate resets  and default losses due to house price depreciation have always been considered in determining the company s allowance for loan losses 
allowance for loan losses as of march  was million  or approximately of the million total consumer loans receivable and construction advances balance 
countryplace management believes this allowance  in conjunction with its planned periodic provision for credit losses  is adequate for expected loan losses  considering the geographic and loan type concentrations of the portfolio expected overall future credit losses  and recent delinquency experience by geographic area and type of loan collateral

inventory consists of raw material and finished goods factory built homes 
we carry very little land held for development and we do not purchase options to acquire land inventory 
each quarter we assess the recoverability of our inventory by comparing the carrying amount to its estimated net realizable value 
our raw materials consist of home building materials and supplies and turn approximately times per month 
our finished goods consist of homes completed under customer order and homes available for purchase at our retail sales centers 
we evaluate the recoverability of our finished homes by comparing our inventory cost to our estimated sales price  less costs to sell 
we estimate our sales price by product type hud code and modular 
approximately of our inventory is located in texas  where the manufactured housing business has not experienced the same declines as california and florida 
historically  the amount of our inventory valuation adjustments has been immaterial 
we are not aware of any trends or other factors that are reasonably likely to result in valuation adjustments in future periods 
these valuations are significantly impacted by estimated average selling prices  average sales rates and product type 
our quarterly assessments reflect management s estimates  which we believe are reasonable 
however  based on the general economic conditions  future results could differ materially from management s judgments and estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  be recognized in financial statements 
that cost will be measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r permits entities to use any option pricing model that meets the fair value objective in the statement 
we adopted sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
on march   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin  an interpretation of statement of financial accounting standard  accounting for income taxes  clarifies the accounting and disclosure requirements for uncertainty in tax positions as defined by the standard 
in connection with the adoption of fin  we have analyzed its filing positions in all significant jurisdictions where it is required to file income tax returns for the open tax years in such jurisdictions 
we have identified as major tax jurisdictions  as defined  its federal income tax return and its state income tax return in states in which we operate 
our federal income tax returns for the years subsequent to march   remain subject to examination 
our income tax returns in major state income tax jurisdictions remain subject to 
table of contents examination for various periods subsequent to march  we currently believe that all significant filing positions are highly certain and that  more likely than not  all of our significant income tax filing positions and deductions would be sustained 
therefore  we have no significant reserves for uncertain tax positions and no adjustments to such reserves were required upon the adoption of fin if interest and penalties are assessed  interest costs will be recognized in interest expense and penalties will be recognized in operating expenses 
in september  the fasb issued statement  fair value measurements fas 
this statement clarifies the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and requires expanded financial statement disclosures about fair value measurements for assets and liabilities 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of the standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  we will need to expand our disclosures in the future about the factors used to determine fair market value of our financial instruments 
in february  the fasb issued statement  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
this statement allows companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value in an effort to mitigate volatility in earnings without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of the standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt  which consists primarily of our liabilities under retail floor plan financing arrangements 
for variable interest rate obligations  changes in interest rates generally do not impact fair market value  but do affect future earnings and cash flows 
assuming our level of variable rate debt as of march  is held constant  each one percentage point increase in interest rates occurring on the first day of the year would result in an increase in interest expense for the coming year of approximately million 
countryplace is exposed to market risk related to the accessibility and terms of long term financing of its loans 
in the past  countryplace accessed the asset backed securities market to provide term financing of its chattel and non conforming mortgage originations 
on july   countryplace successfully completed its initial securitized financing of approximately million of loans 
on march   countryplace completed a second securitized financing of approximately million of loans including approximately million of pre funded loans to be originated in the future 
at present  asset backed and mortgage backed securitization markets are effectively closed to countryplace and other manufactured housing lenders 
accordingly  it is unlikely that countryplace can continue to securitize its loan originations as a means to obtain long term funding 
this inability to continue to securitize its loans caused countryplace to discontinue origination of chattel loans and non conforming mortgages until other sources of funding are available 
we are also exposed to market risks related to our fixed rate consumer loans receivable balances and our convertible senior notes 
for fixed rate loans receivable  changes in interest rates do not change future earnings and cash flows from the receivables 
however  changes in interest rates could affect the fair market value of the loan portfolio 
assuming countryplace s level of loans held for investment as of march  is held constant  a increase in average interest rates would decrease the fair value of countryplace s portfolio by approximately million 
excluding the million of loans held for sale that countryplace sold subsequent to march   a increase in average interest rates would decrease the fair value of countryplace s portfolio by approximately million 
for our fixed rate convertible senior notes  changes in interest rates could affect the fair market value of the related debt 
assuming the amount of convertible senior notes as of march  is held constant  a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of the notes by approximately million
