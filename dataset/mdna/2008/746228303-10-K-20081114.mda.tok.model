item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies  and note to the accompanying financial statements 
the million of capitalized water costs on our balance sheet represents the cost of the water rights we own and the related infrastructure we developed to provide water and wastewater services 
we own or have the exclusive rights to use water in several river basins throughout colorado  with our most significant assets being located in the denver metropolitan area and the arkansas river basin in southern colorado 
each of these assets is explained in detail below 
rangeview water supply and the lowry range our rangeview water the rangeview water supply is a combination of tributary surface water  nontributary and not nontributary groundwater rights  and storage rights associated within the lowry range 
we own approximately  acre feet of non tributary groundwater located in arapahoe county  colorado at property known as the lowry range described below  which we can export from the lowry range to supply water to nearby communities and developers in need of additional water supplies this water asset is referred to as our export water 
in addition  we have the exclusive rights to use  through  approximately  acre feet of tributary surface water and non tributary and not nontributary groundwater located at the lowry range  which is required to be used at the lowry range 
collectively we refer to the  acre feet of export water and the  acre feet of water designated for use at the lowry range as our rangeview water supply 
based on independent engineering estimates  the export water can serve approximately  sfe s and the  acre feet of water designated for use at the lowry range is capable of providing water service to approximately  sfe s  for a combined service capacity of our rangeview water supply of approximately  sfe s 

table of contents we acquired our rangeview water supply in april pursuant to the following agreements  which collectively are referred to as the rangeview water agreements i the amended and restated lease agreement the lease between the state board of land commissioners the land board and the rangeview metropolitan district the district  a quasi municipal political subdivision of the state of colorado  ii the agreement for sale of export water between us and the district  and iii the service agreement between us and the district for the provision of water service to the lowry range 
pursuant to the rangeview water agreements we are required to design  construct  operate and maintain the district s water system to provide water service to customers within the district s service area at the lowry range 
in exchange for providing this water service  we receive of all amounts received by the district relating to water services  after deducting required royalties to the land board  which initially total approximately of gross revenues received from water sales 
the rangeview water agreements require us to charge customers fair market rates for water service based on the average of similar rates and charges at three nearby communities 
see water and wastewater tap fees section below 
we are also required to design  finance  construct  operate and maintain the district s wastewater system to provide wastewater service to customers within the district s service area 
in exchange for providing wastewater services  we receive of the district s wastewater tap fees and of the district s monthly wastewater fees  as well as the rights to use or sell the reclaimed water 
on the lowry range  we operate both the water and the wastewater systems during our contract period and the district owns both systems 
however  after  ownership of the water system infrastructure servicing customers on the lowry range reverts to the land board  with the district retaining ownership of the wastewater infrastructure 
we historically  have contracted with third parties for the construction of these facilities  which is a practice we plan to continue 
off the lowry range  we use our export water to provide water and wastewater services to our customers and we own these facilities 
we have contracted with third parties for the construction of these facilities 
the lowry range property the lowry range was acquired by the land board in the s  and has been characterized by the land board  as one of the most valuable pieces of property in the land board s nearly million acre portfolio 
the lowry range is approximately  acres of undeveloped property located in unincorporated arapahoe county 
of the  acres  we have the exclusive rights to provide water and wastewater services to approximately  acres 
in december  the land board awarded the right to negotiate an exclusive contract for the conservation of approximately  acres  generally along the eastern portion  of the lowry range to the arapahoe grasslands team the grasslands team 
the land board and the grasslands team continue to work towards a definitive agreement regarding the long term conservation and management plan for the  acres 
as of the date of this filing  the land board and the grasslands team have not finalized such an agreement 
in june  the land board entered into an agreement with lend lease lowry range llc lend lease for sole development rights of six sections or approximately  acres of the lowry range 
of this  we have the exclusive rights to provide water and wastewater services to two sections or approximately  acres 
since june  we have been in discussions with lend lease to provide water and wastewater services to the two sections subject to the lease as well as to the other four sections not covered under the lease that the land board seeks to develop 

table of contents as described in a form k we filed on march  with the securities and exchange commission the commission  in  the city of aurora filed an application for conditional water rights with the district court  water division i  state of colorado water court 
in the filing  aurora listed numerous potential sites for reservoirs for storage of its water rights 
three of the potential reservoir sites were located on the lowry range on reservoir sites which had been adjudicated by the district and the land board and for which the land board has previously granted the right to obtain rights of way to the district and us to construct reservoirs 
on november   as a result of a motion for summary judgment filed by the district  the water court ruled in favor of a motion requiring aurora to remove the three reservoir sites from its filing 
on february   aurora filed a motion with the water court for reconsideration of this judgment 
following this  on march   lend lease filed a motion with the water court supporting aurora s reconsideration motion to allow a third party to build and operate a reservoir on sites which had been adjudicated and identified in the lease 
also in this motion  lend lease stated that we may not have the exclusive right to provide water service to the two sections of the lowry range subject to the lease 
in april  the water court denied lend lease s motion to file an amicus brief and upheld its november motion requiring aurora to remove the three reservoir sites from its filing 
aurora has appealed this decision to the colorado supreme court and we  together with the district  intend to vigorously defend our rights to these adjudicated reservoirs sites 
despite these efforts on the part of lend lease and aurora to repudiate our rights and the rights of the land board in the rangeview water supply  recognizing the need to cooperate with other regional water providers in the denver metropolitan area  we have continued to negotiate with the land board  lend lease  and aurora on water and wastewater services to the lowry range 
as of the date of this filing there have been no resolutions on the provision of water and wastewater services to the lowry range 
in october  lend lease notified the land board that it intends to withdraw from the lowry range project on december   unless it is able to obtain sustainable water and wastewater systems for the project at commercially reasonable rates 
we have engaged in  and continue to engage in  discussions with lend lease and the land board concerning our plans to provide sustainable  commercially reasonable  water and wastewater services to the lowry range 
we are discouraged by lend lease s statements regarding their inability to obtain such service despite our nearly two years of negotiations 
during the past twenty years we have been a dedicated partner with the land board in the pursuit of development opportunities at the lowry range and we remain prepared to provide water and wastewater services to the two sections governed under our exclusive agreement as well as the additional four sections the land board seeks to develop 
if lend lease withdraws from the lowry range project  development of the lowry range would likely be delayed for a substantial period of time 
arkansas river water we own approximately  acre feet of senior water rights in the arkansas river basin 
currently this water is being used for agricultural purposes on the approximately  acres of real property we own in southern colorado 
the water rights we own are represented by over  shares of the fort lyon canal company flcc  which is a non profit mutual ditch company established in the s that operates and maintains the mile long fort lyon canal between la junta  colorado and lamar  colorado 
we acquired these assets on august   from high plains a m  llc hp a m pursuant to an asset acquisition agreement the arkansas river agreement 
owning this large portfolio of surface water allows us to more effectively market our water and wastewater services to customers in the denver metropolitan market as well as other markets such as the colorado springs region 
in addition  it expands our service capacities from approximately  sfe s as noted above to approximately  sfe s 
timing of the development of the arkansas river water will depend on the timing of new connections to our existing water and wastewater systems 
we plan to fund the development of the arkansas river water  much like the other water we own  by using proceeds generated from the sale of taps or connection fees associated with new connections to our system 
in addition to increasing our service capacities  this water may present additional market opportunities for us to assist existing water providers in solving their long term water supply needs for their existing and new connections 
along the front range of colorado  there are over separate independent water providers with varying needs for replacement and new water supplies  which we believe presents an opportunity for us to assist these water providers in meeting their future water needs 

table of contents the real and personal property and other non water assets were acquired because the water we intend to ultimately develop for municipal purposes is based on the historical consumptive use of such water 
we anticipate that approximately  acre feet of the  acre feet we own will be available for non agricultural uses along the front range  but this will not be available until we successfully file for a change of use in the colorado water court system 
by owning the land and having the water continue to be used for agricultural purposes  we maintain beneficial use of the water 
we are working with the flcc and other interested parties in the arkansas river valley to mitigate adverse impacts to the local communities and to make investments and decisions on farming operations which benefit us along with the historic water users 
if any of our real property is converted to non irrigated uses  we expect to be required to re vegetate the land 
additional details and agreements related to the arkansas river agreement are explained in note to the accompanying financial statements 
arapahoe county fairgrounds agreement for water service in  we entered into an agreement for water service the county agreement with arapahoe county the county to design  construct  operate and maintain a water system for  and provide water services to  the arapahoe county fairgrounds the fairgrounds  which is located west of the lowry range 
the county agreement anticipated us acquiring acre feet of water from the county  but due to prior water transfers and water court case changes  the actual water we received was reduced to acre feet in as a result of the decrease in the water we acquired  the county made an additional cash payment of approximately  as specified in the county agreement 
further details of the funding arrangements with the county are described in note to the accompanying financial statements 
pursuant to the county agreement we constructed various wholesale and special facilities  including a new deep water well  a  gallon water tank and pipelines to transport water to the fairgrounds 
the construction of the special and wholesale facilities were completed in our fiscal  and we began providing water service to the fairgrounds for the th annual arapahoe county fair on july  sky ranch water supply and water service agreements we own approximately acre feet of water located beneath sky ranch together with the right to purchase an additional acre feet of water for a total of acre feet  which could be used to provide water service to the initial  taps purchased at sky ranch 
we acquired these water rights pursuant to two water service agreements the sky ranch agreements with the developer of approximately acres of property located four miles north of the lowry range along interstate  known as sky ranch 
pursuant to the sky ranch agreements  we are to provide water service to the homes  businesses  schools and other customers at sky ranch  which could include service to up to  sfes 
as reported in our interim reports on form q throughout  the developer of sky ranch filed for bankruptcy protection  therefore  as further described below in item a risk factors  the status of the sky ranch agreements is uncertain as of the date of this filing 
because of the bankruptcy filing  our sky ranch agreements could be rejected  leaving us with damage claims against a bankrupt entity 
alternatively  we may need to renegotiate the sky ranch agreements with whomever the developer of the property may be and the result of those negotiations could result in significantly different terms than those in the sky ranch agreements 
as of the date of this filing  we have not received any payments for tap purchases from the developer and have no information on if or when development of the project will occur 
as part of the sky ranch agreements  the developer is required to dedicate approximately acre feet of water to us in exchange for a  per tap credit for the first water taps purchased 
additionally  pursuant to the sky ranch agreements  the developer is required to pay us million for the construction of certain special facilities required to extend service to sky ranch 
as of august   none of this water has been dedicated to us  sky ranch has not purchased any water taps  and construction of the special facilities has not occurred 
consequently  none of the million for construction of the special facilities has been paid 
we also entered into a five year groundwater purchase agreement with the developer of sky ranch to acquire the acre feet of denver aquifer groundwater located at sky ranch for payments totaling  as of the date of this filing  we have acquired of this water  or acre feet  for payments totaling  the acre feet of water we have acquired from sky ranch does not have to be used at sky ranch  at our discretion this water can be used elsewhere 
due to the developer s bankruptcy filing  we have not been able to complete the acquisition of the remaining of the denver aquifer groundwater located at sky ranch and we are unsure if we will be able to complete that acquisition 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation investing activities for additional information regarding our attempts to purchase the remaining groundwater 

table of contents in addition to this  sky ranch is required to make five annual payments to us of  and  to maintain the right to use our export water at sky ranch 
we received two  payments and one  payment prior to the bankruptcy filing 
we do not expect to receive any additional payments until the bankruptcy is resolved and  depending on the resolution of the bankruptcy  we may not receive any additional payments 
paradise water supply in we acquired the conditional rights to build a  acre foot reservoir to store colorado river tributary water and a right of way permit from the us bureau of land management for property at the dam and reservoir site collectively known as our paradise water supply 
due to the nature of the paradise water rights  the significant development costs of water assets along the western slope  and agreements with other western slope water interests  the use of our paradise water supply is limited to opportunities along the western slope 
see discussion of impairment analysis in the critical accounting policies section below

well enhancement and recovery systems in january  we  along with two other parties each of whom own rd of the venture  formed well enhancement and recovery systems  llc well enhancement llc  to develop a new deep water well enhancement tool and process which we believe will increase the efficiency of wells into the denver basin groundwater formation 
in our fiscal  the well enhancement tool and process was completed and tested on two deep water wells developed by an area water provider with favorable results 
according to studies performed by an independent hydro geologist  preliminary results indicate the well enhancement tool effectively increased the production of the two test wells by approximately and when compared to that of nearby wells developed in similar formations at similar depths 
based on the positive results of the test wells  we continue to refine the process of enhancing deep water wells and anticipate marketing the tool to area water providers during the next months 
revenues we generate revenues predominately from three sources water and wastewater tap fees  construction fees  and monthly service fees 
we typically negotiate the payment terms for tap fees  construction fees  and other water and wastewater service fees with each developer  builder or municipality before we commit to providing service and before construction of the project commences 
water and wastewater tap fees tap fees are paid by the developer in advance of construction activities and are non refundable 
tap fees are typically used to fund construction of the wholesale facilities and defray the acquisition costs of obtaining water rights 

table of contents pursuant to our rangeview water agreements with the district and the land board  pricing for water tap fees as well as water usage charges described further below is controlled through a market driven pricing mechanism in which our rates and charges may not exceed the average of similar rates and charges of three nearby communities referred to as the rate base districts 
due to increases in tap fees at the rate base districts  effective july   water tap fees increased to  per sfe  which is an increase of over the water tap fee of  per sfe 
wastewater tap fees remained unchanged at  table a provides a summary of our water tap fees since table a water system tap fees water tap fees per sfe percentage increase because we own the assets constructed with the tap fees  tap fees are recognized as income over the estimated depreciable service life of the assets constructed with those funds 
revenue recognition begins when the assets are placed into service 
developers owning rights to either surface water or groundwater underlying their properties may receive a credit against a portion of their water tap fees if they elect to sell their water to us  which is negotiated at the time of the service agreement 
construction fees if we agree to build any of the special facilities  the funding received from the developer is deferred 
recognition of the revenues is dependent on the ownership of the assets 
if we own the assets upon completion  then recognition is deferred until construction is completed and the assets are placed into operation 
at that time  the funding from the developer is recorded as income over the estimated service period  which is the estimated useful life of the assets constructed with those funds  consistent with tap fees 
if we do not own the facilities upon completion  we defer the construction fees and recognize the revenues using the percentage of completion method 
monthly service fees monthly water usage charges are assessed to our customers based on actual metered usage each month 
water usage pricing uses a tiered pricing structure which is based on our rate base districts 
despite increases at our rate base districts  in we did not increase our monthly usage rates  however  the tiered pricing structure has increased over the past several years as noted in table b below table b tiered water usage pricing structure price per thousand gallons amount of consumption base charge per sfe gallons to  gallons  gallons to  gallons  gallons and above water revenues are sensitive to timing and volume of water use  meaning the more water used by a customer in a given month  the higher the cost of additional incremental water deliveries to the customer 
based on this  for a typical residential customer using approximately acre feet of water annually  during a typical weather year  water usage fees total approximately per year 
wastewater customers are charged a flat monthly fee of per sfe  or per year per sfe  which was last increased on july  from per sfe  an increase of 
we also collect other immaterial fees and charges from residential customers and other end users to cover miscellaneous administrative and service expenses  such as application fees  review fees and permit fees 

table of contents land board royalties and district fees pursuant to the rangeview water agreements  the land board is entitled to royalty payments based on a percentage of revenues earned from water sales that utilize water dedicated for use on the lowry range or export water 
the calculation of royalties depends on whether the customer is located on the lowry range or elsewhere  and whether the customer is a public or private entity 
in addition  for water sales to customers located on the lowry range  the district is entitled to a fee  which is calculated after the royalty payment to the land board 
the district is entitled to of our wastewater service charge revenue not including wastewater tap fees from customers on the lowry range 
the land board does not receive a royalty from wastewater services 
as further described in item a risk factors  the rangeview water agreements were written prior to any development of the lowry range or areas outside of the lowry range that could utilize our export water 
the terms of the rangeview water agreements did not fully anticipate the specific circumstances of development that have arisen and might arise in the future as we enter into and negotiate agreements for the sale of export water and the provision of service to the lowry range 
therefore  the rangeview water agreements may not clearly delineate the rights and responsibilities for the forms of transactions that may arise 
we are involved in ongoing discussions with the land board to clarify the applicability of contract terms to circumstances that were not anticipated at the time we entered into the rangeview water agreements 
we cannot assure you that the outcome of such negotiations will be favorable to us 
lowry range customers for services to customers located on the lowry range  the district collects fees from customers  pays the royalties to the land board  retains its own fee  and remits the remainder to us 
water service related payments from customers on the lowry range generate royalties to the land board at a rate of of gross revenues 
when either i metered production of water used on the lowry range in any calendar year exceeds  acre feet or ii  surface acres on the lowry range have been rezoned to non agricultural use  finally platted and water tap agreements have been entered into with respect to all improvements to be constructed on such acreage  the land board may elect  at its option  to receive  in lieu of its royalty payments  of the aggregate future net profits derived by the district and pure cycle from the sale or other disposition of water on the lowry range 
to date neither of these conditions has been met 
export water customers payments for export water also generate royalty payments to the land board 
these royalties vary depending on a number of factors including whether the customer is a public or private entity 
when we withdraw  treat and deliver the water to the user and incur the costs related to this process  the royalty to the land board is based on our net revenues  which are our gross revenues less costs  including reasonable overhead allocations  incurred as a direct or indirect result of incremental activity associated with the withdrawal  treatment and delivery of the water 
royalties payable to the land board for export water sold escalate based on the amount of net revenue we receive and are lower for sales to a water district or similar municipal or public entity than for sales to a private entity as noted in table c table c royalties for export water sales royalty rate private public net revenues entity entity over  
table of contents our current operations we designed  built and operate water and wastewater systems that serve our customers on the lowry range 
we also designed  built and operate a water system that provides export water to the fairgrounds 
during fiscal we delivered approximately million gallons of potable water to our customers  which equates to approximately million gallons per month during the winter and over million gallons per month during the summer 
our wastewater treatment facility has a permitted capacity of  gallons per day and currently receives about  gallons per day 
we operate and maintain all our water and wastewater facilities with limited assistance from third party contractors 
we design  construct and operate the facilities serving customers on the lowry range and plan to operate this system  together with facilities serving customers in areas outside the lowry range  in a unified manner to capitalize on economies of scale and ensure the most efficient use of our water 
in august  we entered into the county agreement to provide water services to the fairgrounds 
we commenced service to the fairgrounds in july in  we entered into a water service agreement with the state of colorado department of human services to provide water and wastewater services to a juvenile correction facility near the northwestern edge of the lowry range known as the ridge view youth services center 
this system is designed to provide water and wastewater services for approximately sfes 
we commenced service to the ridge view youth services center in significant customers table d lists the customers which accounted for of more of our revenues for the years ended august   and  respectively 
table d significant customers of water usage fees ridgeview youth services center schmidt aggregates combined of wastewater service fees ridgeview youth services center our projected operations this section should be read in conjunction with item a risk factors 
we intend to design  construct and operate our water and wastewater facilities using advanced water purification and wastewater treatment technologies and to use our water supplies in an efficient manner 
we plan to develop our water and wastewater systems in stages to efficiently meet increasing demands in our service areas  thereby reducing the amount of up front capital costs required for construction 
we use third party contractors to construct our facilities as needed 
we employ licensed water and wastewater operators to operate our water and wastewater systems 
at full build out  we expect to employ professionals that will operate our systems  read meters  bill customers  and manage our operations 
we plan to take advantage of advanced technologies to keep labor and other operating costs low  such as systems that enable meter readings and billings to be done remotely 
we plan to provide an environmentally responsible integrated water management system  as depicted in table e below  which combines conservation efforts with effective water reuse planning and balanced water supply management 
we plan to jointly utilize our surface water rights in the arkansas river  our two surface water streams that flow through the lowry range  groundwater  and our stored reuse water to provide an efficient  environmentally sound  long term water solution for our customers 

table of contents table e our balanced water plan image we anticipate initially developing our denver based water supplies prior to development of our arkansas river water 
in order to deliver the arkansas river water to the front range market  a mile pipeline and water treatment and pumping facilities will need to be constructed having an estimated cost of over million 
we are currently investigating various pipeline alignments and potential partnerships for construction of these facilities 
we are also in discussion with the arkansas valley super ditch that is studying the feasibility of developing a system wide mechanism to transfer water from the arkansas river basin to water short regions through a rotational crop fallowing program 
converting the arkansas water to municipal use and constructing a delivery system will be a long term process  but one which will allow us to work closely with those who might benefit or otherwise be impacted by any water transfers 
the development of this water will require us to apply for a change of use in the colorado water courts which is anticipated to take many years and require a significant capital investment 
however  we do not plan on starting this process in the near term and anticipate that the tap fees and usage fees from taps sold utilizing our rangeview water supply  along with funding from other pipeline partners  will be sufficient to fund the water delivery facilities 
we estimate being able to service over  sfe s with the arkansas river water 
based on our initial development plans  we expect the development of our rangeview water supply to require a significant number of high capacity deep water wells 
we anticipate drilling separate wells into each of the three principal aquifers located beneath the lowry range 
each well is intended to deliver water to central water treatment facilities for treatment prior to delivery to customers 
we also intend to build structures to divert surface water to storage reservoirs to be located on the lowry range 
our plan is to divert the surface water when available and to treat this water prior to distribution to our customers 
based on preliminary independent engineering estimates  the full build out of water facilities on the lowry range will cost in excess of million and will accommodate water service from the rangeview water supply for up to  sfe units  which includes both customers located in and outside the lowry range 
rangeview metropolitan district the district is a quasi municipal corporation and political subdivision of colorado formed in for the purpose of providing water and wastewater service to the lowry range 
the district is required to utilize the  acre feet of water leased to it by the land board to serve customers on the lowry range 
the district is run by an elected board of directors 
the only eligible voters and the only persons eligible to serve as directors are the owners of property within the boundaries of the district 
we own certain rights to the real property which encompasses the current boundaries of the district 
the current directors of the district are mark w 
harding and scott e 
lehman both are employees of pure cycle  and tom lamm 

table of contents we are party to a right of first refusal agreement with the owners of the property comprising the district 
pursuant to a tenancy in common agreement  in the event of death  bankruptcy or incompetence of any tenant  that tenant s estate or representative must offer the property interest of that tenant to the remaining tenants for purchase 
if the remaining tenants do not purchase all of such person s interest  the property must be offered to us pursuant to the right of first refusal agreement 
in addition  if any tenant wants to sell his interest in the parcel  such tenant must find a bona fide buyer and then offer the property to us 
we have the right  at our option  to buy the property by matching the terms of the bona fide third party offer or by paying the appraised value of the property as determined by independent appraisers 
a tenant may also negotiate a sale directly with us if he elects not to locate a bona fide buyer 
each of the directors listed above currently own an undivided interest in the land comprising the district 
under applicable colorado law  entities are not qualified to serve as directors of municipal districts and may not vote 
our president and corporate secretary serve as elected members of the board of directors of the district 
pursuant to colorado law  directors receive for each board meeting or a maximum of  per year 
we and the district s board of directors transact business on an arms length basis 
potential conflicts of interest of the directors in transactions between us and the district are disclosed in filings with the colorado secretary of state 
the district and we were each represented by separate legal counsel in negotiating the rangeview water service agreements and those agreements were approved by the independent members of the district s board and by the land board at the time they were entered into 
it is likely that at some point in the future  the district s board of directors will be comprised entirely of independent directors 
as the land board develops the lowry range  landowners on the lowry range may petition to include their land within the district s boundaries 
provided such petition complies with applicable law  the district is required by the rangeview water service agreements to proceed with due diligence to include the area designated in such petition within the district s boundaries 
as the district s boundaries expand  the base of persons eligible to serve as directors and eligible to vote will also increase 
water and growth in colorado despite the slow housing market and the sluggish economy in general  colorado continues to grow 
the denver regional council of governments drcog  a voluntary association of over county and municipal governments in the denver metropolitan area  estimates that the denver metropolitan area population will increase from today s million people to million people by the year a recent statewide water supply initiative report by the colorado water conservation board estimates that the south platte river basin  which includes the denver metropolitan region  will grow from a current population of more than million to more than million by the year accordingly  approximately of the projected state population increase is anticipated to occur within the south platte river basin 
significant increases in colorado s population  particularly in the denver region and in the water short south platte river basin  together with increasing agricultural  recreational  and environmental water demands will intensify competition for water supplies 
this estimated population increase brings increased demand for water services  exceeding what municipal service providers are currently capable of providing especially during drought conditions as were recently encountered 
the statewide water supply initiative estimates that the population growth in the denver region and the south platte river basin will result in additional water supply needs of over  acre feet by the year as the population in colorado continues to grow  so does the need for obtaining new water sources 
most cities and municipalities now require property developers to demonstrate they have sufficient water supplies for their proposed projects before considering rezoning or annexation applications 
based on this  we focus our water marketing activities on developers and homebuilders that are active along the colorado front range 
colorado s future water supply needs will be met through conservation  reuse and the development of new supplies 
our rules and regulations for water and wastewater service call for adherence to strict conservation measures  including low flow water fixtures  high efficiency appliances  and advanced irrigation control devices  together with rebate incentive programs to further encourage conservation 
additionally  our systems will be designed and constructed using a dual pipe water distribution system 
a dual pipe distribution system has one pipe to supply customers with high quality potable drinking water and a second pipe to supply raw or reclaimed water to homes for irrigation 
typically  about one half of the water needed to meet denver area residential water demands is used for lawn and landscape irrigation 
we  along with most major water providers  believe that raw or reclaimed water supplies provide the lowest cost water for irrigation 
we expect to implement an extensive water reclamation system  in which essentially all effluent water from wastewater treatment plants will be reused to meet non potable water demands 
this will enhance our ability to provide quality water service and reinforce the importance of water recycling and our commitment to environmentally responsible water management policies 

table of contents competition similar to other area water providers  we negotiate individual service agreements with developers and or homebuilders  cities and municipalities to design  construct and operate water and wastewater systems and to provide services 
these service agreements address all aspects of the development of the water and wastewater systems including i the purchase of water and wastewater taps in exchange for our obligation to construct the wholesale facilities  ii the establishment of payment terms  timing  capacity and location of special facilities if any  and iii specific terms related to our provision of ongoing water and wastewater services 
although we have exclusive long term water and wastewater service contracts for the majority of the lowry range we currently have the exclusive rights to serve two of the six initial development sections at the lowry range  providing water service using our export water and arkansas river water is subject to competition 
moreover  competitors have attempted to challenge our exclusive rights to service the lowry range 
see our water assets rangeview water supply and the lowry range lowry range property above 
alternate sources of water are available  principally from other private parties  such as farmers owning senior water rights that are no longer being economically used in agriculture and municipalities seeking to annex newly developed areas in order to increase their tax base 
our principal competition in areas close to the lowry range is the neighboring city of aurora 
the principal factors affecting competition for potential purchasers of our arkansas river water and export water include the availability of water for the particular purpose  the cost of delivering the water to the desired location and the reliability of the water supply during drought periods 
we believe the water assets we own and have the exclusive rights to use  which have a supply capacity of over  sfe units or roughly  people  provide us a significant competitive advantage along the front range because our legal rights to the rangeview water supply have been confirmed for municipal use  a significant portion of our water supply is close to denver area water users  our pricing structure is competitive and our water portfolio is well balanced with senior surface water rights  groundwater rights  storage capacity and reclaimed water

these risks include those listed below and may include additional risks of which we are not currently aware or which we currently do not believe are material 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risk factors actually occurs  our business could be materially adversely affected 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report 
we are dependent on the development of the lowry range  sky ranch  and other areas near our rangeview water supply that are potential markets for our rangeview water supply 
providing water service using our rangeview water supply is one of our principal sources of future revenue 
the timing and amount of these revenues will depend significantly on the development of the lowry range  sky ranch and other potential developments near our rangeview water supply and along the colorado front range 
the development of these areas is not within our control 
lowry range in june  the land board entered into an agreement with lend lease for the sole development rights of six section or approximately  acres of the lowry range 
of this  approximately two section or approximately  acres are subject to our service rights under the lease 
we have been negotiating for some time with lend lease  the city of aurora and the land board to reach a mutually satisfactory service plan for the two sections subject to the lease and the remaining four sections to be developed by lend lease 
however  these negotiations have been unsuccessful so far  and ultimately we may not be able to negotiate an agreement satisfactory to all parties 
additionally  aurora has disputed our rights to certain reservoir sites on the lowry range in the district court  water division i  state of colorado the water court 
in that proceeding  aurora applied for the right to store water in certain reservoir sites on the lowry range which had previously been adjudicated by the district and the land board dating back to as part of that water court proceeding  lend lease filed an amicus curiae brief in support of aurora s motion to reconsider a summary judgment requiring aurora to remove the overlapping reservoir sites from its application 
in its brief  lend lease claimed  in contradiction to the lease  that lend lease may not be required to obtain water and wastewater service exclusively from us for any portion of the development 
lend lease has further stated it may annex the development into the city of aurora 
while aurora has been unsuccessful so far in obtaining rights to the adjudicated reservoirs under the lease  additional legal action may become necessary to enforce our rights to the reservoirs and to provide water and wastewater service to the lowry range 
if additional legal proceedings become necessary and our rights under the lease are adversely ruled upon in such legal proceedings  it could materially adversely impact the value of our interests  including the value of our rangeview water supply 
subsequent to year end  in october  lend lease notified the land board that it intends to withdraw from the lowry range project on december   unless it is able to obtain sustainable water and wastewater systems for the project at commercially reasonable rates 
if lend lease withdrawals from the project  any development of the project could be delayed for a significant period of time and could result in the need for us and the land board to renegotiate the lease 
even if we are able to reach satisfactory agreements with lend lease  aurora  the district and the land board to provide service to the lend lease development  there can be no assurance that development will occur or that water sales will occur on acceptable terms or in the amounts or time required for us to support our costs of operation 
because of the prior use of the lowry range as a military facility  environmental clean up may be required prior to development  including the removal of unexploded ordnance 
there is often significant delay in adoption of development plans  as the political process involves many constituencies with differing interests 
in the event water sales are not forthcoming or development of the lowry range is delayed  we may incur additional short or long term debt obligations or seek to sell additional equity to generate operating capital 
in addition  the land board may not develop large portions of the lowry range significantly limiting our ability to utilize the non export water specifically reserved for use on the lowry range 

table of contents sky ranch the developer of sky ranch has filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
there has been no resolution of the claims against the developer of sky ranch and we do not know how the bankruptcy will impact our agreements with sky ranch 
the sky ranch agreements could be rejected in the bankruptcy proceeding leaving us with unsecured damage claims which would likely have little or no value 
in addition to our claims against the developer  a bank holds a security interest in the entire sky ranch development  including our agreements 
we are not aware of the bank s intentions with respect to its rights in the development 
until these issues are resolved  there will be no development and consequently no sales of water taps or water at sky ranch 
we cannot reasonably predict how long this process will take or whether any of our rights related to sky ranch will have any value following the bankruptcy 
colorado housing market our operations are affected by general economic conditions and the pace and location of real estate development activities in the greater denver metropolitan area  most particularly areas which are close to our rangeview water supply 
since  the colorado housing market has seen declines in new construction  which could continue for some time 
the current instability in the credit markets has exacerbated the decline in demand for new homes 
new connections to our water and wastewater systems depend on real estate development in our service areas 
we have no ability to control the pace and location of real estate development activities which affect our business 
if the downturn in the homebuilding and credit markets continues  intensifies  or if the national economy weakens further and economic concerns intensify  it could have a significant negative impact on our business 
we are involved in on going negotiations with the land board to clarify our rights and obligations with respect to our rangeview water supply and such negotiations may not be successful 
our rangeview water supply rights derive principally from the lease between the land board and the district which was entered into in prior to any development of the lowry range or of areas outside the lowry range that utilize our export water 
the terms of the lease did not fully anticipate the specific circumstances of development that have arisen and may not clearly delineate rights and responsibilities for the forms of transactions that may arise in the future 
we are involved in ongoing discussions with the land board to clarify the terms of the lease 
an unfavorable outcome in such negotiations could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we cannot assure you that such negotiations will be successful 
in order to utilize the arkansas river water acquired in fiscal  we must apply for a change of use with the colorado water court and this may take several years to complete 
the change of use of our arkansas river water requires a ruling by the colorado water courts  which could take several years and be a costly and contentious effort since it is anticipated that many parties will oppose the change of use and the transfer of the water 
there are several conditions which must be satisfied prior to our receiving a change of use decree for transfer of our arkansas river water 
one condition that we must satisfy is a showing of anti speculation in which we  as the applicant  must demonstrate that we have contractual obligations to provide water service to customers prior to the water court ruling on the transfer of a water right 
the water court is also expected to limit the transfer to the consumptive use portion of the water right and to address changing the historic use of the water from agricultural uses to other uses such as municipal and industrial use 
we expect to face opposition to any consumptive use calculations of the historic agricultural uses of this water 
the water court may impose conditions on our transfer of the water rights such as requiring us to mitigate the loss of the farming tax base  imposing re vegetation requirements to convert soils from irrigated to non irrigated  and imposing water quality measures 
any such conditions will likely increase the cost of transferring the water rights 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital to develop our water rights  in particular the arkansas river water 
development of water rights requires a substantial capital investment 
we anticipate financing water and wastewater systems primarily through the sale of water taps and water delivery charges to users 
however  we cannot assure you that these sources of cash will be sufficient to cover our capital costs 
moreover  the development of the arkansas river water will require a pipeline or other infrastructure to deliver the water to the front range  which is anticipated to cost over million 
we likely would be required to partner with others to finance a project of this magnitude and there is no assurance we would be able to obtain the financing necessary to develop our arkansas river water 

table of contents our valuation of the tap participation fee payable to hp a m contains estimates and management assumptions 
the actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
as part of our acquisition of the arkansas river water rights from hp a m  we granted hp a m a tap participation fee entitling hp a m to receive ten percent of the gross proceeds of our sales of forty thousand  water taps 
for accounting purposes we have estimated the fair value of the tap participation fee payable to hp a m using available historic market information and estimated future market information 
we believe the estimates we used reasonably reflect the fair value of the tap participation fee 
accounting estimates involve matters of uncertainty and judgment and interpreting relevant market data is inherently subjective in nature 
many factors are necessary to estimate future market conditions  including but not limited to  supply and demand for new homes  population growth along the front range  tap fee increases at our rate base districts  and other market forces beyond our control 
the actual results could differ materially from our accounting estimates which would result in significantly higher fees being paid to hp a m than what are reflected in our balance sheet and significantly higher imputed interest being reflected on our future statements of operations associated with the tap participation fee 
in the event of default by hp a m on promissory notes secured by deeds of trust on our properties  we would be required to cure the defaults or lose the properties 
certain of the real properties we acquired from hp a m are subject to promissory notes  aggregating million in principal and interest as of august  the notes are secured by deeds of trust on the properties we own  but are solely the responsibility of hp a m 
because of hp a m s financial position and the substantial penalties imposed on hp a m in the event of a default  the likelihood of hp a m defaulting on the notes is deemed remote 
as a result the promissory notes are not reflected on our balance sheet 
however  if hp a m was to default on the notes  and we did not cure the defaults  we would lose up to approximately of the real properties we acquired and the water rights associated with those properties 
our net losses may continue and we may not have sufficient liquidity to pursue our business objectives 
we have experienced significant net losses and could continue to incur net losses 
for the years ended august   and  we had net losses of approximately million  million and  respectively  on revenues of approximately   and  in the respective periods 
our cash flows from operations have not been sufficient to fund our operations in the past  and we have been required to raise debt and equity capital to remain in operation 
since  we have raised approximately million through the issuance of common stock to support our operations 
our ability to fund our operational needs and meet our business objectives will depend on our ability to generate cash from future operations 
if our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are not sufficient to fund our operations and the significant capital expenditure requirements to build our water delivery systems  we may be forced to reduce or delay our business activities  or seek to obtain additional debt or equity capital  which may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
the rates we are allowed to charge customers on the lowry range are limited by the lease with the land board and our contract with the district and may not be sufficient to cover our costs of construction and operation 
the prices we can charge for our water and wastewater services on the lowry range are subject to pricing regulations set in the lease with the land board 
both the tap fees and our usage rates and charges are based on the average of the rates of our rate base districts 
annually we survey the tap fees and rates of our rate base districts and set our tap fees and rates and charges based on the average of those charged by this group 
our costs associated with the construction of water delivery systems and the production  treatment and delivery of our water are subject to market conditions and other factors  which may increase at a significantly greater rate than the prices charged by our rate base districts 
factors beyond our control and which cannot be predicted  such as drought  water contamination and severe weather conditions  like tornadoes and floods  may result in additional labor and material costs that may not be recoverable under our rate structure 
either increased customer demand or increased water conservation may also impact the overall cost of our operations 
if the costs for construction and operation of our water services  including the cost of extracting our groundwater  exceed our revenues  we may petition the land board for rate increases 
there can be no assurance that the land board would approve a rate increase request beyond the average of the rate base districts 
our profitability could be negatively impacted if we experience an imbalance of costs and revenues and are not successful in receiving approval for rate increases 

table of contents we only have three employees and may not be able to manage the increasing demands of our expanding operations 
we currently have only three employees to administer our existing assets  interface with applicable governmental bodies  market our services and plan for the construction and development of our future assets 
we may not be able to maximize the value of our water assets because of our limited manpower 
we depend significantly on the services of mark w 
harding  our president 
the loss of mr 
harding would cause a significant interruption of our operations 
the success of our future business development and ability to capitalize on growth opportunities depends on our ability to attract and retain additional experienced and qualified persons to operate and manage our business 
state regulations set the training  experience and qualification standards required for our employees to operate specific water and wastewater facilities 
failure to find state certified and qualified employees to support the operation of our facilities could put us at risk  among other things  for operational errors at the facilities  for improper billing and collection processes  and for loss of contracts and revenues 
we cannot assure you that we can successfully manage our assets and our growth 
we may be adversely affected by any future decision by the colorado public utilities commission to regulate us as a public utility 
the colorado public utilities commission cpuc regulates investor owned water companies operating for the purpose of supplying the public 
the cpuc regulates many aspects of public utilities operations  including the location and construction of facilities  establishing water rates and fees  initiating inspections  enforcement and compliance activities and assisting consumers with complaints 
we do not believe we are a public utility under colorado law 
we currently provide services by contract to the district  which supplies the public 
quasi municipal metropolitan districts  such as the district  are exempt by statute from regulation by the cpuc 
however  the cpuc could attempt to regulate us as a public utility 
if this were to occur  we might incur significant expense challenging the cpuc s assertion of jurisdiction  and we may be unsuccessful 
in the future  existing regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  and new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities 
if we become regulated as a public utility  our ability to generate profits could be limited and we might incur significant costs associated with regulatory compliance 
there are many obstacles to our ability to sell our paradise water supply 
we currently earn no revenues from our paradise water supply  which as of august  has a recorded cost of approximately million 
our ability to convert our paradise water supply into an income generating asset is limited 
due to the nature of the paradise water rights and agreements with other western slope water interests  our use of the paradise water supply is limited to opportunities along the western slope 
as part of our water court decree for the paradise water supply  we are permitted to construct a storage facility on the colorado river 
however  due to a stipulation entered into with various objectors to our paradise water rights and the strict regulatory requirements for constructing a reservoir on the main stem of the colorado river  we do not anticipate completing the storage facility at its decreed location 
we cannot assure you that we will ever be able to make use of this asset or sell the water profitably 
our paradise water supply is also conditioned on a finding of reasonable diligence from the water court every six years 
to arrive at that finding  the water court must determine that we continue to diligently pursue the development of the water rights 
if the water court is unable to make such a finding  our right to the paradise water supply would be lost and we would be required to impair the paradise water supply asset and incur a million charge against earnings 
the fiscal review was completed in but not without objectors and not without us having to agree to certain stipulations to remove the objections 
in order to continue to maintain the paradise water right  over the next six years we must i select an alternative reservoir site  ii file an application in water court to change the place of storage  iii identify specific end users and place s of use of the water  and iv identify specific source s of the water rights for use 

table of contents conflicts of interest may arise relating to the operation of the district 
our officers and employees constitute a majority of the directors of the district 
pure cycle  along with our officers and employees and one unrelated individual  own  as tenants in common  the acres that form the district 
we have made loans to the district to fund its operations 
at august   total principal and interest owed to us by the district was approximately  the district is a party to our agreements with the land board and receives fees of of the revenues from the sale of water on the lowry range 
proceeds from the fee collections will initially be used to repay the district s obligations to us  but after these loans are repaid  the district is not required to use the funds to benefit pure cycle 
we have received benefits from our activities undertaken in conjunction with the district  but conflicts may arise between our interests and those of the district  and with our officers who are acting in dual capacities in negotiating contracts to which both we and the district are parties 
we expect that the district will expand when more properties are developed and become part of the district  and our officers acting as directors of the district will have fiduciary obligations to those other constituents 
there can be no assurance that all conflicts will be resolved in the best interests of pure cycle and its shareholders 
in addition  other landowners coming into the district will be eligible to vote and to serve as directors of the district 
there can be no assurances that our officers and employees will remain as directors of the district or that the actions of a subsequently elected board would not have an adverse impact on our operations 
we are required to maintain stringent water quality standards and are subject to regulatory and environmental risks 
we must provide water that meets all federal and state regulatory water quality standards and operate our water and wastewater facilities in accordance with these standards 
we face contamination and pollution issues regarding our water supplies 
improved detection technology  increasingly stringent regulatory requirements  and heightened consumer awareness of water quality issues contribute to an environment of increased focus on water quality 
we cannot assure you that in the future we will be able to reduce the amounts of contaminants in our water to acceptable levels 
in addition  the standards that we must meet are constantly changing and becoming more stringent 
future changes in regulations governing the supply of drinking water and treatment of wastewater may have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our water supplies are subject to contamination  including contamination from naturally occurring compounds  pollution from man made sources and intentional sabotage 
in addition  we handle certain hazardous materials at our water treatment facilities  primarily sodium hypochlorite 
any failure of our operation of the facilities or any contamination of our supplies in the future  including sewage spills  noncompliance with water quality standards  hazardous materials leaks and spills  and similar events could expose us to environmental liabilities  claims and litigation costs 
if any of these events occur  we may have to interrupt the use of that water supply until we are able to substitute the supply from another source or treat the contaminated supply 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully manage these issues  and failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
we might not be able to recover the costs associated with these liabilities through our rates and charges or insurance or such recovery may not occur in a timely manner 
our contracts for the construction of water and wastewater projects may expose us to certain completion and performance risks 
we intend to rely on independent contractors to construct our water and wastewater facilities 
these construction activities may involve risks  including shortages of materials and labor  work stoppages  labor relations disputes  weather interference  engineering  environmental  permitting or geological problems and unanticipated cost increases 
these issues could give rise to delays  cost overruns or performance deficiencies  or otherwise adversely affect the construction or operation of our water and wastewater delivery systems 
in addition  we may experience quality problems in the construction of our systems and facilities  including equipment failures 
we cannot assure you that we will not face claims from customers or others regarding product quality and installation of equipment placed in service by contractors 
certain of our contracts may be fixed price contracts  in which we may bear all or a significant portion of the risk for cost overruns 
under these fixed price contracts  contract prices are established in part based on fixed  firm subcontractor quotes on contracts and on cost and scheduling estimates 
these estimates may be based on a number of assumptions  including assumptions about prices and availability of labor  equipment and materials  and other issues 
if these subcontractor quotations or cost estimates prove inaccurate  or if circumstances change  cost overruns may occur  and our financial results would be negatively impacted 
in many cases  the incurrence of these additional costs would not be within our control 

table of contents we may have contracts in which we guarantee project completion by a scheduled date 
at times  we may guarantee that the project  when completed  will achieve certain performance standards 
if we fail to complete the project as scheduled  or if we fail to meet guaranteed performance standards  we may be held responsible for cost impacts and or penalties to the customer resulting from any delay or for the costs to alter the project to achieve the performance standards 
to the extent that these events occur and are not due to circumstances for which the customer accepts responsibility or cannot be mitigated by performance bonds or the provisions of our agreements with contractors  the total costs of the project could exceed our original estimates and our financial results would be negatively impacted 
our customers may require us to secure performance and completion bonds for certain contracts and projects 
the market environment for surety companies has become more risk averse 
we secure performance and completion bonds for our contracts from these surety companies 
to the extent we are unable to obtain bonds  we may not be awarded new contracts 
we cannot assure you that we can secure performance and completion bonds where required 
we may operate engineering and construction activities for water and wastewater facilities where design  construction or system failures could result in injury to third parties or damage to property 
any losses that exceed claims against our contractors  the performance bonds and our insurance limits at such facilities could result in claims against us 
in addition  if there is a customer dispute regarding performance of our services  the customer may decide to delay or withhold payment to us 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations  which could affect demand for our water service and our revenues 
demand for our water during the warmer months is generally greater than during cooler months due primarily to additional requirements for water in connection with cooling systems  irrigation systems and other outside water use 
throughout the year  and particularly during typically warmer months  demand will vary with temperature and rainfall levels 
if temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than expected or there is more rainfall than expected  the demand for our water may decrease and adversely affect our revenues 
weather conditions and overuse may interfere with our sources of water  demand for water services  and our ability to supply water to our customers 
we depend on an adequate water supply to meet the present and future demands of our customers and to continue our expansion efforts 
unexpected conditions may interfere with our water supply sources 
drought and overuse may limit the availability of water 
these factors might adversely affect our ability to supply water in sufficient quantities to our customers and our revenues and earnings may be adversely affected 
additionally  cool and wet weather  as well as drought restrictions and our customers conservation efforts  may reduce consumption demands  also adversely affecting our revenue and earnings 
furthermore  freezing weather may also contribute to water transmission interruptions caused by pipe and main breakage 
if we experience an interruption in our water supply  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

table of contents results of operations executive summary the results of our operations for the years ended august   and were as follows table h summary results of operations change millions of gallons of water delivered water revenues generated water delivery operating costs incurred excluding depreciation and depletion water delivery gross margin wastewater treatment revenues wastewater treatment operating costs incurred wastewater treatment gross margin general and administrative expenses net losses water and wastewater usage revenues our water service charges are based on a tiered pricing structure that provides for higher prices as customers use greater amounts of water 
our rates and charges are established based on the average of three surrounding communities  referred to as our rate base districts 
table b in item business  outlines our tiered pricing structure and changes during fiscal  and  respectively 
our wastewater customers are charged flat monthly fees based on their number of tap connections 
fiscal compared to fiscal water deliveries during fiscal dropped approximately over water deliveries in fiscal  due mainly to precipitation being higher in fiscal however  water usage fees in fiscal increased over fiscal which is mainly a result of the timing of water usage and an increasing block pricing scale as of july  for an entire fiscal year in versus two months in fiscal wastewater usage fees remained at per wastewater tap per month and before that they increased july   from to per wastewater tap per month 
consistent with water taps  the increased wastewater fees in fiscal is a result of the higher usage fees being charged for the entire fiscal versus two months in fiscal gross margins for water services remained constant from fiscal to fiscal gross margins for wastewater services in fiscal increased over fiscal due to certain testing and compliance expenses incurred during fiscal not experienced in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal water deliveries during fiscal dropped approximately over water deliveries in fiscal this was a result of high precipitation experienced throughout the front range of colorado starting in december and lasting into the spring of increased precipitation results in our customers using less water for irrigation 
water usage fees in fiscal decreased over fiscal  despite the decrease in gallons delivered 
this was a result of increased usage fees effective july  wastewater usage fees increased july   from to per wastewater tap per month and before that they increased on july   from to per wastewater tap per month  which accounted for the changes in revenues between the fiscal years 

table of contents gross margins for water and wastewater services declined in fiscal over fiscal this is due to declines in the amount of water delivered 
decreased water deliveries do not typically equate to a decrease in the energy usage within the systems  and therefore  in reduced delivery years  gross margins will typically be lower 
the decline is also due to certain testing and compliance expenses incurred during fiscal not experienced in the previous year 
general and administrative and other expenses general and administrative g a expenses for fiscal  and were impacted by the stock based compensation recognized pursuant to the adoption of sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r  as follows amounts are approximate table i g a expenses years ended august  change g a expenses as reported stock based compensation expenses g a expenses less sfas r expenses the changes in g a expenses are mainly attributable to the following fiscal compared to fiscal from fiscal to fiscal  g a expenses decreased approximately  which is mainly a result of excluding stock based compensation expenses our salary and salary related expenses in fiscal and would have been  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
salary and salary related expenses including stock based compensation expenses totaled approximately  and million for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
the decrease in salaries is mainly attributable to management and employee wages remaining unchanged in and there being no incentive compensation paid in as compared to incentive compensation of  being paid in fiscal upon the completion of the july equity offering 
professional fees legal and accounting totaled approximately  and  for and  respectively 
this decrease of  is a result of legal and accounting bills incurred in fiscal related to our consultations with the staff of the commission which did not recur in franchise fees to the state of delaware and nasdaq listing fees decreased approximately  from  in fiscal to approximately  in fiscal this is due to our reincorporation into colorado saving us franchise fees payable to the state of delaware 
the above decreases were offset by the following significant increases 
during fiscal and  we expensed approximately  and  related to water assessment charges payable to the flcc 
this is an increase of  which is a result of the flcc increasing assessments for the current year 
this represents our share based on the number of flcc shares we own of flcc s annual operating and maintenance expenditures 
additionally  in fiscal and we expensed approximately  and  for work performed in the arkansas river valley on our behalf by hp a m  respectively 
the increase is a result of increased salaries to the hp a m farm management personnel which resulted in an increase in our costs 
we paid approximately  and  in consulting fees related to our discussions with lend lease as it relates to the potential development of six sections of the lowry range in fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal from fiscal to fiscal  g a expenses increased approximately  which is mainly a result of excluding stock based compensation  salary and salary related expenses in fiscal and would have been  and  respectively  an increase of  salary and salary related expenses including stock based compensation expenses totaled approximately million and  for the fiscal years ended august  and  respectively 
the increase in salary and salary related expenses is mainly attributable to incentive compensation of  being paid in fiscal upon completion of the july equity offering  which exceeded the  of incentive compensation paid in fiscal during fiscal  we expensed approximately  related to water assessment charges payable to the flcc 
additionally  in fiscal we expensed approximately  for work performed in the arkansas river valley on our behalf by hp a m 
these charges were not incurred during fiscal because we acquired the arkansas water rights in the fourth quarter of fiscal professional fees legal and accounting totaled approximately  and  for and  respectively 
approximately  of the increase was a result of services performed in connection with our consultations with the staff of the commission completed during fiscal the remaining increase resulted primarily from the internal control audit that was carried out to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of franchise fees to the state of delaware and nasdaq listing fees increased approximately  due to the increase in our total assets as a result of the arkansas river water acquisition and the issuance of common stock as a result of the exercising of stock options 
in fiscal we paid approximately  in consulting fees related to our discussions with lend lease as it related to the potential development of six sections of the lowry range  which were not incurred in fiscal depreciation and depletion charges for the years ended august   and were approximately   and  respectively 
fiscal and were consistent  but the increase from fiscal to fiscal is mainly a result of additional depreciation charges associated with the water delivery fixtures acquired from hp a m on august  depreciation began on september  and depreciation of capitalized legal costs associated with the hp a m asset acquisition 
in addition  in late fiscal we began depreciating the costs incurred to extend the water system to the fairgrounds 
we expect the depreciation and depletion charges going forward to remain consistent with the fiscal charges 
interest income totaled approximately   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
this represents interest earned on the temporary investment of capital in cash equivalents or available for sale securities  interest accrued on the note payable by the district and interest accrued on the special facilities construction proceeds receivable from the county 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal of approximately  was due to additional funds being invested in interest bearing accounts as a result of the proceeds raised in the july equity offering 
the decrease of approximately  from fiscal to fiscal was due to fewer funds being invested and earning interest as a result of the county construction project in fiscal and cash used in operations 
cash that was invested was not raised until the july equity offering so during fiscal we had lower investment balances 
imputed interest expense related to the tap participation fee payable to hp a m totaled approximately million  million and for fiscal  and  respectively 
this represents the expensed portion of the difference between the relative fair value of the liability and the net present value of the liability recognized under the effective interest method 
the decrease in the imputed interest expense of approximately  was a result of the updated valuation performed in the first quarter of fiscal which is explained in greater detail in note to the accompanying financial statements 

table of contents interest expense related parties was approximately  and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
all interest bearing debt related parties  was paid off or extinguished as of august  further  in october  we repaid approximately  of non interest bearing related party debt and now we no longer have any debt with scheduled maturities 
interest expense non related parties was approximately  and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
all interest bearing debt was extinguished as of august  our net losses  as reported in our statements of operations in fiscal  and  were approximately million  million and  respectively 
our reported net losses have been materially impacted by the imputed interest on the tap participation fee and stock based compensation expense recognized pursuant to sfas r 
in table j below  we have presented a non gaap financial disclosure to provide a quantitative analysis of the impact of the imputed interest and stock based compensation expenses on our reported net losses and loss per share 
because these items do not require the use of current assets  management does not include these items in its analysis of financial results or how we allocate our resources 
because of this  we deemed it meaningful to provide this non gaap disclosure of the impact of these significant items on our financial results 
table j non gaap financial disclosure years ended august  change net loss as reported interest imputed on tap participation fee payable to hp a m stock based compensation expense net loss less imputed interest and stock based compensation expense net loss per common share as reported interest imputed on tap participation fee payable to hp a m stock based compensation expense net loss per common share less imputed interest and stock based compensation expense weighted average common shares outstanding net losses increased in each of the years presented above  after the effects of the stock based compensation and interest on the tap participation fee  mainly as a result of the items discussed in the g a section above  and as a result of the impact to our operations of the caa transactions described in note to the accompany financial statements 
liquidity  capital resources and financial position at august   our working capital  defined as current assets less current liabilities  was approximately million  and we had cash and cash equivalents on hand totaling approximately million 
we also have an effective shelf registration statement pursuant to which we may elect to sell up to another million of stock at any time and from time to time 
we believe that at august   we have sufficient working capital to fund our operations for the next year 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in marketing the water from our primary water projects in the near term 
in order to generate working capital to support our operations  we may incur additional short or long term debt or seek to sell additional equity securities 
development of the water that we own  have rights to use  or may seek to acquire  will require substantial capital investments 
we anticipate that capital required for the development of the water and wastewater systems will be financed through the sale of water taps to developers and water delivery charges to users 
we anticipate tap fees will be sufficient to generate funds with which we can design and construct the necessary wholesale facilities 
however  once we receive tap fees from a developer  we are contractually obligated to construct the wholesale facilities for the taps paid for  even if our costs are not covered by the fees we receive 
we cannot assure you that these sources of cash will be sufficient to cover all our capital costs 

table of contents pursuant to the arkansas river agreement we agreed to pay hp a m of our water tap fees received on the sale of the next  water taps 
as of august   we have estimated the value of the tap participation fee at approximately million based on a discounted cash flow valuation analysis  which was originally prepared at august   and was updated as of november  see note in the accompanying financial statements for the impact of the revaluation 
the actual amount to be paid could exceed our estimates 
tap participation payments are not payable to hp a m until we receive water tap fee payments 
we did not sell any taps or make any tap participation fee payments during the year ended august  as of august   there are  taps that remain subject to the tap participation fee 
we are obligated to pay the flcc annual water assessment charges which are the charges assessed to the flcc shareholders for the upkeep and maintenance of the fort lyon canal 
the payments are due to the flcc each calendar year 
in december  the board and shareholders of the flcc approved an increase in the calendar assessments from per share to per share  which equates to an increase in our water assessments from approximately  per year to approximately  per year 
on august   we entered into the county agreement to provide water service to the fairgrounds 
in accordance with gaap  upon completion of construction of the fairgrounds facilities and the initiation of water service to the fairgrounds in july  we began ratably recognizing deferred tap fee revenues as income 
the tap fees received from the county are being recognized in income over the estimated useful life of the constructed assets  or years 
in addition  we started recognizing deferred special facilities funding as revenues in fiscal  which will also be recognized over the useful life of the constructed assets 
see also note to the accompanying financial statements for information regarding the amendment to the county agreement in regards to the special facilities funding and the receipt of water rights in august repayment of all related party and non related debt in october  we repaid our sole outstanding note to a related party 
therefore  at august   we had no outstanding related party or non related party debt 
operating activities operating activities include revenues we receive from the sale of water and wastewater services to our customers  costs incurred in the delivery of those services  g a expenses  and depletion depreciation expenses 
cash used by operating activities was approximately million  million and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease of approximately one million dollars from fiscal to fiscal is a result of having a gain on the extinguishment of caa interests of approximately  whereas fiscal had a loss on the extinguishment of caa interests of approximately  which is a  year over year impact to the cash flow statement 
the remaining difference was due to the timing of payments and receipts related to operating assets 
as a result of the arkansas river agreement signed on august   we imputed approximately million  million and of interest on the tap participation fee in fiscal  and  respectively 
these are reflected as non cash items in the statements of cash flows 
during fiscal  and we accrued interest on the note receivable from the district of approximately   and  respectively  which is comparable period over period 
we also accrued approximately   and of interest on the construction proceeds receivable from the county during  and  respectively 
the decrease in the construction proceeds interest income is a result of payments made by the county since the prior year  which reduced the interest income recognized under the effective interest method  and due to the amendment to the county agreement reached with the county as described in note to the accompanying financial statements 
there was no interest recognized in fiscal because the construction was not completed until the end of our fiscal 
table of contents we incurred approximately   and  of depreciation  depletion and other non cash charges during fiscal  and  respectively 
as noted above  the increase from is a result of the depreciation of capitalized legal costs associated with the hp a m asset acquisition  the depreciation of water delivery equipment in the arkansas river valley  both of which started on september  and in late fiscal we began depreciating the costs incurred to extend the water system to the arapahoe county fairgrounds 
we will continue to provide domestic water and wastewater service to customers in our service area and we will continue to operate and maintain our water and wastewater systems with our own employees 
investing activities on october  we entered into the denver groundwater purchase agreement the dgpa with the developer of sky ranch

on march  and may   we exercised our rights and purchased a total of acre feet of denver aquifer groundwater for payments totaling  during our fiscal and fiscal we made the two required  payments pursuant to the dgpa  however  we have not received the water rights deeds from the developer  nor has the developer cashed either of the payments 
in november   the developer of sky ranch filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
because of the bankruptcy and since we have not received our water rights deeds from sky ranch  we have cancelled the two un cashed checks issued to sky ranch and have reversed the  that was included in the prepaid expenses account on our balance sheet 
we will continue to follow the bankruptcy proceedings of sky ranch and vigorously seek to enforce our rights under the dgpa and other sky ranch agreements 
however  our rights related to sky ranch may have no value following the bankruptcy 
refer to the risk factors in item a for additional information on the bankruptcy 
we continue to invest in legal and engineering fees associated with our water rights  and we continue to invest in the right of way permit fees to the department of interior bureau of land management and legal and engineering costs for our paradise water supply 
cash provided used by investing activities for fiscal  and was approximately  million and million  respectively 
investing activities in consisted mainly of  received from the maturity of available for sale securities  offset by  of investments in water rights 
the fiscal cash provided by investing activities was positively impacted by the sale of lawma shares  as more fully described in note to the accompanying financial statements and the sale of approximately million of available for sale securities

b the participating interests liability is payable to the caa holders upon the sale of export water  and therefore  the timing of the payments is uncertain and not reflected in the above table by period

because the timing of these water tap sales is not fixed and determinable  the estimated payments are not reflected in the above table by period 
the amount listed above includes an unamortized discount of approximately million 
the valuation of the tap participation fee payable to hp a m is a significant estimate based on available historic market information and estimated future market information 
many factors are necessary to estimate future market conditions  including but not limited to  supply and demand for new homes  population growth along the front range  cash flows  tap fee increases at our rate base districts  and other market forces beyond our control 
because the estimates and assumptions used to value the tap participation fees payable to hp a m are subjective  actual results could vary materially from the estimates 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
pure cycle has limited exposure to market risks from instruments that may impact the balance sheets  statements of operations  and statements of cash flows  such exposure is due primarily to changing interest rates 
interest rates 
the primary objective for our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified short term interest bearing investments 
as of august   we no longer have any investments which are subject to market risks as the majority of our capital is invested predominately in overnight money market funds related to us treasury obligations which earn interest at stated rates 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk
