item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel peptide based drug candidates to improve the treatment of serious and often life threatening conditions 
our lead product candidate  hematide  is designed to treat anemia associated with chronic renal failure and cancer 
anemia is a serious condition in which blood is deficient in red blood cells and hemoglobin 
it is common in patients with chronic renal failure  cancer  heart failure  inflammatory diseases and other critical illnesses  as well as in the elderly 
if left untreated  anemia may increase the risk of other diseases or death 
hematide is a synthetic peptide based erythropoiesis stimulating agent  or esa  designed to stimulate production of red blood cells 
hematide is designed to be longer acting than currently marketed esas in the us  and therefore has the potential to offer both better care for patients and reduced cost and complexity for healthcare providers 
we are conducting phase clinical trials in patients suffering from chronic renal failure  on dialysis and pre dialysis 
we are conducting four open label  randomized controlled clinical trials 
of these trials  two trials are being conducted in pre dialysis patients and are designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hematide compared to darbepoetin alfa to correct anemia and maintain hemoglobin in a corrected range over time 
the other two trials are being conducted in dialysis patients and are designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of hematide and its ability to maintain hemoglobin levels in a corrected range compared to epoetin alpha or epoetin beta when switched to hematide 
analysis of efficacy and safety for all of the phase studies will be based on assessments of non inferiority to the comparator drugs 
the primary efficacy endpoint will be the mean change in hemoglobin from baseline 
each study is planned to continue until the last patient has been treated for weeks 
in addition  the assessment of safety will include a composite cardiovascular endpoint from a pooled safety database 
the rate of accrual of these cardiovascular events could affect the duration of the studies if the events accrue at a higher or lower rate than estimated 
hematide is at an earlier stage of development for chemotherapy induced anemia in comparison to our renal program and as part of our collaboration with takeda pharmaceutical company limited  or takeda  takeda has assumed primary responsibility for regulatory and clinical development activities related to the worldwide oncology program 
in january  takeda initiated a phase clinical trial for the treatment of chemotherapy induced anemia in prostate  breast and non small cell lung cancer patients in the us to date  we have not generated any product revenue 
we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  expense reimbursements  license fees and milestone payments from collaborative partners  operating and capital lease financings  interest earned on investments and limited license fees and royalties from licensing intellectual property 
since inception we have incurred net losses and expect to incur substantial and increasing losses for the next several years as we expand our research and development activities and move our product candidates into later stages of development 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in december  we issued  shares of our common stock in connection with our initial public offering  including the issuance of  shares upon the full exercise of the underwriters option to cover over allotments 
the aggregate net proceeds from the offering  including the shares issued upon exercise of the over allotment option  were approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering expenses 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of i license fees paid to third parties for use of their intellectual property  ii expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations and investigative sites  which conduct a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials  iii payments to contract manufacturing organizations  which produce our active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  iv payments to consultants  v employee related expenses  which include salaries and related costs  and vi facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and equipment  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
all research and development expenses are expensed as incurred 
although we cannot predict the total amount our future research and development expenses with any degree of certainty  we expect to incur substantially increasing research and development expenses in future periods particularly expenses arising from clinical development activities including the enrollment of our phase clinical trials 
in addition  we may conduct more research and perform preclinical studies and clinical trials for any other product candidates we choose to advance but would seek to enter into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of those product candidates 
the table below sets out our research and development expenses excluding stock based compensation expenses by project since as a percentage of total research and development expenses for the applicable period 
we commence tracking the costs for a project when we are working with another company or when the related prototype peptide demonstrates significant biological activity  typically in a cell free assay  and merits substantial increase in the level of effort 
hematide other research programs total does not include any projects where the expense is or greater of total research and development expenses excluding stock based compensation expense 
under the worldwide agreement with takeda  we will share responsibility for clinical development activities required for us regulatory approval of hematide 
we will have primary responsibility for hematide s clinical development plan and clinical trials in the dialysis and pre dialysis indications  while takeda will have primary responsibility in the chemotherapy induced anemia and anemia of cancer indications 
beginning january   takeda was responsible for the first million of third party expenses related to development in pursuit of us regulatory approval of hematide 
of the first million of third party expenses related to the development in pursuit of us regulatory approval of hematide to be borne by takeda  a total of million was incurred by both parties through december  we expect that the remaining million will be incurred during the first quarter of thereafter  takeda will bear of the third party us development expenses  while we will be responsible for of the expenses 
the company retains responsibility for of its internal development expenses 
takeda will have primary responsibility and bear all costs for hematide clinical development in support of regulatory approval for all territories outside the united states 
except for hematide  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates  if any  will be subject to future partnerships or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
the process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain food and drug administration  or fda approval is costly and time consuming 
the probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the product candidate s early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capabilities and commercial viability 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments and the risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent  we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
while we are currently focused on developing our lead product candidate  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which additional programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as ongoing assessment as to the product candidate s commercial potential 
we anticipate developing additional product candidates internally and intend to consider in licensing product candidates  which will increase our research and development expenses in future periods 
we believe that the cash received from takeda  existing cash  cash equivalents and investments and the interest thereon  will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations through at least mid however  we will be required to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of hematide and we will need to raise additional capital to support continued development of our product candidates thereafter 
we cannot be certain that that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business and commercial development  information technology  legal and human resources functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses  patent prosecution and defense costs and professional fees for legal  consulting  auditing and tax services 
we expect to incur increasing general and administrative expense in future periods to support our research and development activities  preparation for the new drug application for hematide  costs associated with our j j litigation and development of commercial capabilities 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to revenue recognition and clinical development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our audited financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  we consider whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting as defined in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
application of this standard requires subjective determinations and requires management to make judgments about the fair value of the individual elements and whether such elements are separable from the other aspects of the contractual relationship 
in february and june  we entered into two separate collaboration agreements with takeda  or the arrangement  which have been combined for accounting purposes due to their proximity of negotiation 
we evaluated the multiple elements under the combined single arrangement in accordance with the provisions of eitf we determined the deliverables do not have value to the customer on a stand alone basis and we were unable to obtain verifiable objective evidence to determine the fair value of the undelivered elements 
accordingly  we concluded that there was a single unit of accounting 
we were unable to determine the period of our performance obligations under the arrangement as our required participation on the joint steering committee extends for as long as products subject to the collaboration with takeda are being sold by either of the parties 
accordingly  the contractual term of our joint steering committee obligations was considered indefinite 
as a result  revenue for the single unit of accounting was recorded on a proportional performance basis as long as the overall arrangement was determined to be profitable during the years ended december  and we accounted for the arrangement using a zero profit proportional performance model ie  revenue was recognized equal to direct costs incurred  but not in excess of cash received or receivable assuming that the overall arrangement was expected to be profitable 
we used an input based measure  specifically direct costs  to determine proportional performance because we believed that the inputs were representative of the value being conveyed to takeda through the research and development activities and delivery of the api 
we believed that using direct costs as the unit of measure of proportional performance also most closely reflected the level of effort related to our performance under the arrangement 
direct costs were those costs that directly resulted in the culmination of an earnings process for which takeda received a direct benefit 
the nature of these costs were third party and internal costs associated with conducting clinical trial activities for dialysis and pre dialysis indications  costs associated with the manufacturing of api and api stability testing  allocated payroll related costs for representatives participating on the joint steering committee and sales and marketing costs during the co commercialization period 
direct costs specifically excluded costs of a general and administrative nature  upfront payments to manufacturers unrelated to specific product manufactured such as reservation of capacity  cost for api not yet delivered to takeda  travel and expense related costs  sales and marketing costs during the development period  any research and development costs not associated with hematide  interest  depreciation and amortization expense 
amounts resulting from payments received in advance of revenue recognized were recorded as deferred revenue in accordance with the zero profit proportional performance model described above until the earlier of i when we can meet the criteria for separate recognition of each element under the guidance of eitf  or ii after we have fulfilled all of our contractual obligations under the arrangement 
we are required to assess the profitability of the overall arrangement on a periodic basis throughout the life of the arrangement when events or circumstances indicate a potential change in facts 
profitability is defined as a net cash inflow resulting from the arrangement over its life 
such assessment is based on estimates to determine the most likely outcome based on available facts and circumstances at each assessment date 
the estimates include the consideration of factors such as the progress and timing of clinical trials  competitive esas in the market  the development progress of other potential esas  drug related serious adverse events and other safety issues in the clinical trials  pricing reimbursement in relevant markets and historical costs incurred compared to original estimates 
when the periodic assessment or other events or circumstances indicate a loss will result from performance under the arrangement  we will continue to recognize costs as they are incurred 
however  revenue will be deferred until either i the arrangement becomes profitable  at which point revenue will continue to be recognized  or ii the end of the arrangement 
effective january   we entered into an amendment to the arrangement with takeda 
the amendment modifies the ongoing commitments with respect to our participation on the joint steering committee such that the contractual term of that obligation is no longer indefinite 
as a result  we determined that we can separate the performance obligations which occur over the development period from the performance obligations that will occur during the commercialization period 
as a result of the change in performance period from indefinite to approximately years  beginning on january   we will recognize revenue during the development period using the contingency adjusted performance model capm 
the cumulative effect adjustment of million for the change of estimate  which results from now being able to estimate the period of performance  will be recognized as additional revenue during the three months ending march  through the period of the joint steering committee obligation  we expect collaboration revenue to be directly affected by milestone payments and expenses that are eligible for reimbursement from takeda under the arrangement in future periods 
upon commercialization  we will recognize revenue from the manufacture and supply of the api upon delivery  if all other sab criteria for revenue recognition are met 
royalty payments  profit share payments and sales milestone payments will be recognized as revenue when earned  if all other sab criteria for revenue recognition are met 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals we estimate our preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on our estimates of the services received pursuant to contracts with several research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven expenses and payment flows 
preclinical study and clinical trial expenses include the following fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical studies  fees paid to contract research organizations and clinical research organizations in connection with clinical trials  and fees paid to contract manufacturers and service providers in connection with the production and testing of active pharmaceutical ingredients and drug materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
payments under some of these contracts depend on factors such as the milestones accomplished  successful enrollment of certain numbers of patients  site initiation and the completion of clinical trial milestones 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period 
if the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
if we do not identify costs that we have begun to incur or if we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of these services  our actual expenses could differ from our estimates 
stock based compensation through december   we have accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion  or apb  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  including the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  an interpretation of apb opinion no 
under apb no 
 compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the date of grant between the fair value of our common stock and the exercise price of the stock option 
for periods prior to december   we have complied with the disclosure only provisions required by statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas no 
r  which requires compensation costs related to share based transactions  including employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on fair value 
sfas no 
r revises sfas no 
 as amended  and supersedes apb no 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the prospective transition method 
under this method  compensation cost is measured and recognized for all share based payments granted  modified and settled subsequent to december  in accordance with the prospective transition method  our financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas no 
r 
we account for stock based compensation arrangements with nonemployees in accordance with sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 and eitf  no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  using a fair value approach 
for stock options granted to nonemployees  the fair value of the stock options is estimated using the black scholes valuation model 
this model utilizes the estimated fair value of common stock and requires that  at the date of grant  we make assumptions with respect to the remaining contractual term of the option  the volatility of the fair value of our common stock  risk free interest rates and expected dividend yields of our common stock 
different estimates of volatility and expected term of the option could materially change the value of an option and the resulting expense 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin no 
 that prescribes a comprehensive model for the recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure in financial statements of any uncertain tax positions that have been taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin no 
resulted in no adjustment to retained earnings as of january  however  at the adoption date of january   we had million of unrecognized tax benefits which were reduced in the year ended december  by  we recorded a million fin no 
liability for uncertain income tax positions for the year ended december   which was reflected as a long term income tax liability on our balance sheet 
we adopted a policy to include penalties and interest expense related to income taxes as a component of other expense and interest expense  respectively  if they are incurred 
for the years ended december   and no penalties or interest expense related to income tax positions were recognized 
we do not anticipate that any of the unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease significantly over the next twelve months 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease in thousands  except percentages revenue    research and development expenses 
   general and administrative expenses 
   interest income expense  net    other income expense  net provision for income taxes   net loss    accretion of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock revenue 
we recognized million and million of revenue under our arrangement with takeda for the years ended december  and  respectively  under the zero profit proportional performance model  as discussed in the notes to our audited financial statements 
the increase in revenue was primarily due to the growth in direct costs associated with the increase in clinical trial activity and headcount in connection with hematide 
we recognized immaterial revenues for the years ended december  and from royalty payments 
research and development expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses of million was primarily due to an increase of million in clinical trial costs resulting principally from additional clinical trials and enrollment of more patients  an increase of million in personnel costs resulting from increased headcount and stock based compensation expenses and a  technology license fee for which the technological feasibility had not been established and there is no alternative future use 
the increase in research and development expenses from the year ended december  to was lowered by a milestone payment of million in connection with the nektar license that was expensed during the year ended december  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in personnel costs resulting from higher headcount  and stock based compensation expenses and an increase of million in sarbanes oxley  legal and other consulting fees 
interest income expense  net 
the increase in interest income  net  was due primarily to higher level of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during the year 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  was immaterial for the years ended december  and provision for income taxes 
we are subject to federal and california state income tax 
we recorded a provision for income taxes for the year ended december  we were in a net operating loss position in and all prior periods and therefore did not record a provision for income taxes for the year ended december  accretion of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock 
our convertible preferred stock was redeemable at the request of the holders on or after july  we were accreting the carrying value of the preferred stock to the mandatory redemption amount using the effective interest method through periodic charges to additional paid in capital 
we recorded accretion on the preferred stock through the date of the automatic conversion of all of our outstanding preferred stock into common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering in december comparison of years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease in thousands  except percentages revenue    research and development expenses    general and administrative expenses    interest income expense  net    other income expense  net net loss    accretion of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock revenue 
we recognized million of revenue under our arrangement with takeda for the year ended december  under the zero profit proportional performance model  as discussed in the notes to our audited financial statements 
we recognized immaterial revenues for the years ended december  and from royalty payments 
research and development expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to a million in milestone payments in connection with the nektar license  an increase of approximately million in clinical trial costs resulting from three additional clinical trials and enrollment of higher number of patients  an increase of approximately million in personnel costs resulting from increased headcount and stock based compensation expense and an increase in costs associated with the manufacturing and testing of hematide 
general and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in personnel costs resulting from higher headcount and increased legal and audit fees  which was decreased by lower stock based compensation expenses 
interest income expense  net 
the increase in interest income  net  was due primarily to higher level of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as well as higher interest rates during the year 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  was immaterial for the years ended december  and accretion of mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock 
our convertible preferred stock was redeemable at the request of the holders on or after july  we were accreting the carrying value of the preferred stock to the mandatory redemption amount using the effective interest method through periodic charges to additional paid in capital 
we recorded accretion on the preferred stock through the date of the automatic conversion of all of our outstanding preferred stock into common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering in december pursuant to our previous amended and restated certificate of incorporation  all outstanding shares of preferred stock would have been converted into common stock upon the closing of an offering where the price per share is greater than  the gross proceeds to us are at least million and we have a pre offering market capitalization of at least million 
we recorded a non cash charge of  and  in the year ended december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through sale of capital stock  license fees  milestone payments and reimbursement for development and commercial expenses and manufacturing costs from collaborative partners  operating and capital lease financing  interest earned on investments and limited license fees and royalties from licensing intellectual property 
from inception through december   we have received net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock and convertible preferred stock and million of upfront license fees  a million milestone payment and million for the reimbursement of development and commercial expenses and purchase of api from our collaboration agreements with takeda 
of the first million of third party expenses related to the development in pursuit of us regulatory approval of hematide to be borne by takeda under the arrangement  a total of million was utilized by both parties through december  including million in receivables at december  we expect that the remaining million will be utilized during the first quarter of thereafter  takeda will bear of the third party us development expenses  while we will be responsible for of the expenses 
as of december   we had million in unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investments 
our cash and investment balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including obligations of us government agencies  corporate bonds  commercial paper  auction rate securities  or ars  and money market funds 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation 
as of december   we had million invested in auction rate securities  or ars  issued principally by municipal entities and rated aaa by a major credit rating agency 
ars are structured to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  usually every days 
however  recent events have caused overall liquidity concerns in the ars markets and have resulted in failed auctions during the first quarter of in january  all ars with january auction reset dates had successful auctions at which their interest rates were reset 
however  based on failed auctions since then and the expectation of continued failures through the filing date of our annual report on form k  we classified million of ars held as long term investments as of december  the million represents all ars held as of december  that had not been sold as of february  as of february   we had million of our investment portfolio invested in ars  million of which was purchased after december  if the auctions for the securities we own continue to fail  the investments may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful  the securities mature  or we sell the securities in the secondary market 
based on our expected cash usage in and our balance of cash and other investments  we do not anticipate the current illiquidity of these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as usual for at least twelve months 
based on successful auctions in january and the continued creditworthiness of our ars  we determined that the securities did not experience an other than temporary impairment as of december  in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we will continue to monitor failures in our ars and consider the impact of future failures on the ars we hold 
for example  although our ars continue to pay interest according to their stated terms  if the illiquidity continues  these investments may be subject to a decline in value  which would require us to recognize a charge for impairment 
we may also be required to sell these investments at prices significantly below par 
if this occurs  we may not be able to liquidate these securities to obtain funds when needed  which could negatively affect our ability to fund our operations 
year ended december  in thousands cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  working capital   long term investments   year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    capital expenditures included in investing activities above net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  primarily reflects the development of hematide and other product candidates partially offset by a milestone payment and direct cost reimbursements from takeda 
cash used in the period includes the net loss  which was reduced in part by non cash expenses including stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization  as well as an increase in prepaid expenses  other current assets and other assets primarily as a result of payments made at the initiation of our phase clinical trials for hematide 
cash provided by operations includes a million milestone payment  million for the reimbursement of development and commercial expenses and purchase of api by takeda and an increase in accounts payable  long term income tax liability and other long term liabilities due to the timing of payments 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  primarily reflects the million of upfront license fees received from takeda  which was partially offset by the net loss for the period 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  primarily reflects research and development of hematide and other product candidates  which was reduced in part by non cash expenses including stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  primarily reflects net maturities of investments  which was offset by purchases of property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and was primarily related to net purchases of investments and  to a lesser extent  purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the proceeds from the exercise of stock options  as the lock up agreements with the underwriters of our initial public offering that restricted our stockholders ability to transfer shares of our common stock did not expire until june  and proceeds from the purchase of common stock in april and october under our employee stock purchase plan  which was adopted in december net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the net proceeds of our initial public offering of million and the issuance of series e preferred stock to takeda 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to the issuance of series d preferred stock 
our future contractual obligations  including financing costs  at december  were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands capitalized lease obligations operating lease obligations     long term income tax liability  total fixed contractual obligations    with respect our long term income tax liability as of december   we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
in april  we entered into a license  manufacturing and supply agreement with nektar therapeutics al  corporation  or nektar  under which we obtained from nektar a worldwide  non exclusive license  with limited rights to grant sublicenses  to certain intellectual property covering pegylation technology to manufacture  develop and commercialize hematide 
in consideration of the license grant  we agreed to pay royalties on the sales of hematide 
we also agreed to pay milestone payments totaling up to million  plus possible additional milestones in connection with our partnering activities relating to hematide or merger and acquisition activities 
in july  we paid nektar a million milestone payment triggered by the collaboration agreements signed with takeda in february and june under the agreement  we also engaged nektar for the manufacture and supply of our requirements of bulk poly ethylene glycol reagent for the manufacture of hematide 
this relationship is managed by a managing committee formed by representatives from both us and nektar 
nektar is obligated to engage a third party manufacturer in the event of nektar s failure as defined in the agreement to supply reagent 
this agreement expires  on a country by country basis  upon the expiration of our royalty payment obligations 
the agreement may be terminated by either party for the other party s material breach provided that such other party has been given a chance to cure such breach  or by nektar for our challenge of the validity or enforceability of any patents licensed thereunder 
in september  we entered into an operating lease for additional office space in palo alto  california 
the lease commenced in november and terminates in december the total square footage covered by the new lease is  square feet  of which we leased  square feet starting in november and the remaining  square feet starting in september in december  we entered into an extension of the operating lease for office space in palo alto  california 
the lease extension commences in october and terminates in september the total square footage covered by the lease extension is  square feet  of which we lease  square feet starting in october and the remaining  square feet starting in january our future capital requirements will depend on many forward looking factors and are not limited to the following the initiation  progress  timing and completion of preclinical studies and clinical trials for our drug candidates and potential drug candidates  our ability to maintain and achieve milestones under our collaboration agreements with takeda  costs of litigation  outcome  timing and cost of regulatory approvals  delays that may be caused by changing regulatory requirements  the number of drug candidates that we pursue  the costs involved in filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing and defending patent claims  timing and terms of future in licensing and out licensing transactions  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  cost of procuring clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
we believe that the existing cash  cash equivalents and investments together with the interest thereon  will enable us to maintain our currently planned operations through at least mid however  we expect that we will need to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of hematide 
our capital requirements are likely to increase 
as a result  we may need to raise additional funds to support our operations  and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed we may not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic partnerships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business and operating results 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
 which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
sfas no 
is effective commencing with our fiscal year annual financial statements and fiscal for certain non financial assets and liabilities 
we are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas no 
 which is effective january  sfas no 
permits us to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas no 
is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement  with is consistent with the board s long term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements on the adoption date of january  in june  the eitf issued issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  or eitf no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  eitf no 
requires us to defer and capitalize nonrefundable advance payments for research and development activities 
such amounts will be recognized as expenses as the goods are delivered or the services are performed 
if we do not expect the goods to be delivered or the services to be performed  the capitalized amounts should be expensed 
we believe that the adoption of eitf no

quantitative and qualitative disclosure of market risks interest rate risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the goals of our investment policy are preservation of capital  fulfillment of liquidity needs and fiduciary control of cash and investments 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our goals  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
we do not believe that a decrease in interest rates would have a material negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
as of december   we had million invested in auction rate securities  or ars  issued principally by municipal entities and rated aaa by a major credit rating agency 
ars are structured to provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  usually every days 
however  recent events have caused overall liquidity concerns in the ars markets and have resulted in failed auctions during the first quarter of in january  all ars with january auction reset dates had successful auctions at which their interest rates were reset 
however  based on failed auctions since then and the expectation of continued failures through the filing date of our annual report on form k  we classified million of ars held as long term investments as of december  the million represents all ars held as of december  that had not been sold as of february  as of february  we had million of our investment portfolio invested in ars  million of which was purchased after december  if the auctions for the securities we own continue to fail  the investments may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful  the securities mature  or we sell the securities in the secondary market 
based on our expected cash usage in and our balance of cash and other investments  we do not anticipate the current illiquidity of these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as usual for at least twelve months 
based on successful auctions in january and the continued creditworthiness of our ars  we determined that the securities have did not experience an other than temporary impairment as of december  in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we will continue to monitor failures in our ars and consider the impact of future failures on the ars we hold 
for example  although our ars continue to pay interest according to their stated terms  if the illiquidity continues  these investments may be subject to a decline in value  which would require us to recognize a charge for impairment 
we may also be required to sell these investments at prices significantly below par 
if this occurs  we may not be able to liquidate these securities to obtain funds when needed  which could negatively affect our ability to fund our operations 
the table below presents the weighted average interest rates and related carrying amounts of our investment portfolio as of december  and weighted average interest rate carrying amount weighted average interest rate carrying amount in thousands in thousands cash equivalents   short term investments   long term investments   foreign exchange risk we have no investments denominated in foreign currencies  and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
at each quarter end  we may have liabilities for costs incurred by overseas suppliers of goods or services and clinical trial programs that are denominated in foreign currencies that are not hedged because of their small size  uncertainty of payment date  and or short time until settlement 
an increase or decrease in exchange rates on these unhedged exposures may affect our operating results
