item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a multi state managed healthcare company focused on serving people who receive healthcare benefits through publicly sponsored programs  including medicaid  schip  familycare and medicare advantage programs 
we were founded in december with the objective of becoming the leading managed care organization in the us focused on serving people who receive these types of benefits 
we continue to believe that managed healthcare remains the only proven mechanism that significantly reduces medical costs  helps our government partners control their costs  and improves health outcomes for those receiving these types of benefits 
revenue growth in as of december   our membership has increased by  members or to  members  which includes approximately  members for which aso services are provided 
the membership growth is due primarily to our entry into the tennessee market in the middle grand region in april and the western region with our acquisition of mmcc effective november  premium revenues increased approximately  million or 
this increase is due primarily to commencement of operations in middle tennessee  a full year impact of operations in georgia which began serving members in june in atlanta and in the remaining regions we serve in the fall of  expansion of services to abd members in two new texas markets  austin and san antonio beginning in  and the initiation of services to abd members in ohio in february the remaining growth in is a result of premium rate increases and yield increases resulting from changes in membership mix across many of our markets 
investment income and other increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of higher interest rates and an increase in the average balance of invested assets over the prior year 
the increase in the average invested balances was largely driven by the establishment of restricted assets held as collateral in opportunities for future membership growth in september  we received approval from cms to offer both medicare advantage special needs plans and medicare advantage health plans in the following states florida  maryland  new jersey  new mexico  new york  tennessee and texas 
we had previously offered medicare advantage special needs plans in maryland and texas 
we expanded our service areas in these two states and added medicare advantage health plans 
we are serving members in all seven states beginning in january in august  we concluded the contracting process with the state of south carolina to begin serving medicaid enrollees under the new south carolina healthy connections choices program 
the program will be implemented by region  with the midlands region  or the columbia area  designated as the first area of service 
we began enrollment in december on april   amerigroup tennessee  inc began offering healthcare coverage to medicaid members in the state of tennessee for the middle grand region 
as of december   amerigroup tennessee  inc served approximately  members in the middle grand region 
on november   we acquired the contract rights and substantially all of the assets of mmcc  including substantially all of the assets of midsouth health solutions  inc  a subsidiary of mmcc 
as of december   amerigroup tennessee  inc served approximately  members under an aso arrangement in the west tennessee region as a result of this acquisition 
we believe this acquisition will strengthen our ability to respond to the west tennessee request for proposal rfp that was released in january the state of tennessee intends to convert the contracts in that region from an aso arrangement to a risk arrangement 
we are in the process of establishing a contract with the state of new mexico to serve the long term care segment of the medicaid population 
depending upon the pace of implementation established by the state  we may begin operations in we can make no assurance that these efforts will result in new business for us or if that new business will be favorable to our results of operations or financial condition 
as of december   approximately of our current membership has resulted from eleven acquisitions 
we periodically evaluate acquisition opportunities to determine if they align with our business strategy 
we continue to believe acquisitions can be an important part of our long term growth strategy 
market updates on january  we submitted our response to a request for proposal for expanded markets and reprocurement of our existing markets for the florida healthy kids program 
we anticipate the state will award contracts in early to mid with an implementation date of fall of in march  the district of columbia released an rfp to provide managed care services to medicaid and dc alliance members in the district 
our subsidiary  amerigroup maryland  inc  submitted a response to the rfp on july  we anticipate that the district will award the contracts to between two and four managed care organizations  based upon a best value evaluation which includes premium rates  in mid we anticipate implementation following a contract award 
if we are not awarded a contract through this process  we can make no assurance that our business  results of operations and financial condition would not be materially and adversely affected 
contingencies update on the qui tam litigation as described in item legal proceedings of this form k  we have appealed the million verdict against us in the qui tam litigation to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit 
on september   we filed our memorandum of law in support of our appeal with the court of appeals 
on december   the united states of america and the state of illinois filed a joint brief  and the relator filed a brief  in response to our memorandum of law 
we have until february  to file our reply to these briefs with the court of appeals  which we intend to do 
following filing this brief  we expect the court of appeals to set a date for oral arguments prior to rendering a decision 
while we do not control this timeline it is possible the court of appeals could render a decision as early as summer  but there is no assurance that the decision will not occur at an earlier or later date 
although it is possible that the ultimate outcome of the qui tam litigation judgment will not be favorable to us  the amount of loss  if any  is uncertain 
accordingly  we have not recorded any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes  if any  as a result of the qui tam litigation judgment 
there can be no assurances that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
for additional information on the qui tam litigation  see item legal proceedings qui tam 
experience rebate payable amerigroup texas  inc is required to pay an experience rebate to the state of texas in the event profits exceed established levels 
the experience rebate calculation reports that we filed for the state fiscal years sfys through have been audited by a contracted auditing firm retained by the state 
in their report  the auditor challenged the inclusion in the experience rebate calculation of certain expenses incurred by the company in providing services to amerigroup texas  inc for services obtained from amerigroup corporation under an administrative services agreement 
the audits of experience rebate calculation reports for sfys and are in process 
in february  we resolved all of the open audit issues with respect to the experience rebate calculation reports for sfys and prior and those experience rebate reports are now final 
with respect to the experience rebate calculation reports for sfys and  we also reached agreement on the nature and amount of the administrative expenses incurred by amerigroup texas  inc  for services provided by amerigroup corporation under the administrative services agreement that can be included in the experience rebate calculation 
the impact of this resolution has been fully recognized in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  which resulted in an increase to selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately million 
risk sharing receivable in the fort worth service area  amerigroup texas  inc had an exclusive risk sharing arrangement with cook children s health care network cchcn and cook children s physician network ccpn  which includes cook children s medical center ccmc that was terminated as of august  under the risk sharing arrangement the parties have an obligation to perform annual reconciliations and settlements of the risk pool for each contract year 
we have recorded a receivable in the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements for the contract year  in the amount of million  as of december  the contract with cchcn prescribes reconciliation procedures which have been completed 
cchcn subsequently engaged external auditors to review all medical claims payments made for the contract year and has provided the preliminary results to us 
we are currently in discussions with the parties regarding resolution of this matter 
although we continue to believe this to be a valid receivable  if we are unable to resolve this matter resulting in payment in full to us  our results of operations may be adversely affected  and we may incur significant costs in our efforts to reach a final resolution of this matter 
new jersey provider network in december  amerigroup new jersey  inc  our new jersey subsidiary  received a notice of deficiency for failure to meet provider network requirements in several new jersey counties as required by our medicaid contract with new jersey 
to date  we have not received notice of any final determination regarding our compliance with provider network requirements or possible fines and penalties 
if we are unable to materially satisfy the provider network requirements  the state of new jersey could impose fines and penalties that could have a material impact on our financial results 
florida behavioral health a florida statute the statute gives the florida agency for health care administration ahca the right to contract with entities to provide comprehensive behavioral healthcare services  including mental health and substance abuse services 
the statute further requires the contractor to use at least of the capitation for the provision of behavioral healthcare services  with any shortfall in the expenditure being refunded to the state 
in april  our florida subsidiary amerigroup florida inc  and ahca resolved the disagreement regarding this matter for the and contract years and amerigroup florida  inc paid approximately million to ahca 
discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be significant 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily from premiums and aso fees we receive from the states in which we operate to arrange for health benefit services for our members 
we receive premiums from cms for our medicare advantage members 
we recognize premium and aso fee revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
a fixed amount per member per month is paid to us to arrange for healthcare benefit services for our members pursuant to our contracts in each of our markets 
these premium payments are based upon eligibility lists produced by our government partners 
errors in this eligibility determination on which we rely can result in positive and negative revenue adjustments to the extent this information is adjusted by the state 
adjustments to eligibility data received from our government partners result from retroactive application of enrollment or disenrollment of members or classification changes of members between rate categories that were not known by us in previous months due to timing of the receipt of data or errors in processing by our government partners 
these changes while common are not generally large 
retroactive adjustments to revenue for corrections in eligibility data are recorded in the period in which the information becomes known 
we estimate the amount of outstanding retroactivity each period and adjust premium revenue accordingly  if appropriate 
historically  the impact of these adjustments has represented less than of annual revenue  which results in a negligible impact on annual earnings as changes in revenue are typically accompanied by corresponding changes in the related health benefits expense 
we believe this historical experience represents what is reasonably likely to occur in future periods 
in all of the states in which we operate  except tennessee and virginia  we are eligible to receive supplemental payments to offset the health benefits expenses associated with the birth of a baby 
each state contract is specific as to what is required before payments are collectible 
upon delivery of a baby  each state is notified according to our contract 
revenue is recognized in the period that the delivery occurs and the related services are provided to our member based on our authorization system for these services 
changes in authorization and claims data used to estimate supplemental revenues can occur as a result of changes in eligibility noted above or corrections of errors in the underlying data 
adjustments to revenue for corrections to authorization and claims data are recorded in the period in which the corrections become known 
historically  the impact of these adjustments has represented less than of annual revenue which results in a negligible impact on annual earnings as changes in revenue are typically accompanied by corresponding changes in the related health benefits expense 
we believe this historical experience represents what is reasonably likely to occur in future periods 
estimating health benefits expense and claims payable the most judgmental accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable 
at december   this liability was million and represented of our total consolidated liabilities 
included in this liability and the corresponding health benefits expenses for incurred but not reported ibnr claims are the estimated costs of processing such claims 
health benefits expenses have two main components direct medical expenses and medically related administrative costs 
direct medical expenses include amounts paid to hospitals  physicians and providers of ancillary services  such as laboratories and pharmacies 
medically related administrative costs include items such as case and disease management  utilization review services  quality assurance and on call nurses 
we have used a consistent methodology for estimating our medical expenses and medical claims payable since inception  and have refined our assumptions to take into account our maturing claims  product and market experience 
our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best point estimate within a level of confidence required by actuarial standards 
actuarial standards of practice generally require a level of confidence such that the liabilities established for ibnr have a greater probability of being adequate versus being insufficient  or such that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions 
adverse conditions are situations in which the actual claims are expected to be higher than the otherwise estimated value of such claims at the time of the estimate 
therefore  in many situations  the claim amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 
in developing our medical claims payable estimates  we apply different estimation methods depending on the month for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for mature incurred months generally the months prior to the most recent three months  we calculate completion factors using an analysis of claim adjudication patterns over the most recent month period 
a completion factor is an actuarial estimate  based upon historical experience  of the percentage of incurred claims during a given period that have been adjudicated as of the date of estimation 
we apply the completion factors to actual claims adjudicated to date in order to estimate the expected amount of ultimate incurred claims for those months 
we do not believe that completion factors are fully credible for estimating claims incurred for the most recent two to three months which constitute the majority of the amount of the medical claims payable 
accordingly  we estimate health benefits expenses incurred by applying observed medical cost trend factors to the average per member per month pmpm medical costs incurred in a more complete time period 
medical cost trend factors are developed through a comprehensive analysis of claims incurred in prior months for which more complete claim data is available 
the average pmpm is also adjusted for known changes in hospital authorization data  provider contracting changes  changes in benefit levels  age and gender mix of members  and seasonality 
the incurred estimates resulting from the analysis of completion factors  medical cost trend factors and other known changes are weighted together using actuarial judgment 
many aspects of the managed care business are not predictable with consistency 
these aspects include the incidences of illness or disease state such as cardiac heart failure cases  cases of upper respiratory illness  the length and severity of the flu season  diabetes  the number of full term versus premature births and the number of neonatal intensive care babies 
therefore  we must rely upon our historical experience  as continually monitored  to reflect the ever changing mix  needs and growth of our members in our assumptions 
among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members  seasonal variations in utilization  identified industry trends and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements  including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitated  as opposed to a fee for service  basis 
these considerations are aggregated in the medical cost trend 
other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  catastrophes and epidemics may impact medical cost trends 
other internal factors such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical cost trends 
medical cost trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy 
management is required to use considerable judgment in the selection of health benefits expense trends and other actuarial model inputs 
completion factors are the most significant factors we use in developing our medical claims payable estimates for older periods  generally periods prior to the most recent three months 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical claims payable estimates for those periods as of december  completion factor increase decrease in increase decrease in factor medical claims payable in millions reflects estimated potential changes in health benefits expenses and medical claims payable caused by changes in completion factors used in developing medical claims payable estimates for older periods  generally periods prior to the most recent three months 
medical cost pmpm trend factors are the most significant factors we use in estimating our medical claims payable for the most recent three months 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the estimated potential impact on our medical claims payable estimates for the most recent three months as of december  medical cost pmpm trend increase decrease in increase decrease in factor medical claims payable in millions reflects estimated potential changes in health benefits expenses and medical claims payable caused by changes in medical costs pmpm trend data used in developing medical claims payable estimates for the most recent three months 
the analyses above include those outcomes that are considered reasonably likely based on the company s historical experience in estimating its medical claims payable 
changes in estimates of medical claims payable are primarily the result of obtaining more complete claims information that directly correlates with the claims and provider reimbursement trends 
volatility in members needs for medical services  provider claims submission and our payment processes results in identifiable patterns emerging several months after the causes of deviations from assumed trends occur 
since our estimates are based upon pmpm claims experience  changes cannot typically be explained by any single factor  but are the result of a number of interrelated variables  all influencing the resulting experienced medical cost trend 
deviations  whether positive or negative  between actual experience and estimates used to establish the liability are recorded in the period known 
we continually monitor and adjust the medical claims payable and health benefits expense based on subsequent paid claims activity 
if it is determined that our assumptions regarding medical cost trends and utilization are significantly different than actual results  our results of operations  financial position and liquidity could be impacted in future periods 
adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional health benefits expense or a reduction of health benefits expense in the period an adjustment is made 
further  due to the considerable variability of health care costs  adjustments to medical claims payable occur each quarter and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that quarter 
prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuaries judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued 
the following table presents the components of the change in medical claims payable for the three years ended december in thousands medical claims payable as of january medical claims payable assumed from businesses acquired during the year health benefits expenses incurred during the year related to current year related to prior years total incurred health benefits payments during the year related to current year related to prior years total payments medical claims payable as of december current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year health benefits expenses incurred health benefits expenses incurred related to prior years as a percent of prior year medical claims payable as of december health benefits expenses incurred related to prior years as a percent of the prior year s health benefits expenses related to current year health benefits expenses incurred during the year  related to prior years for the year ended december  of approximately million were comparable to that in the prior year of approximately million 
as our medical claims payable estimate increases in amount due to increases in our membership base and inflationary increases in medical costs  the absolute dollar amount of subsequent changes to that estimate will increase even if the accuracy of our medical claims payable estimate remains consistent as a percentage of our original estimate 
health benefits expenses incurred during the year  related to prior years for the year ended december  increased approximately million from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of medical claims payments which increased at a more modest rate than estimated at the end of claims payments for dates of service occurring in the early portion of increased significantly  based on available claims payment information as of december  we estimated health benefits expenses would continue to increase significantly through the remainder of as claims for medical services delivered in the second half of were paid during  it became apparent that the elevated cost trends we anticipated did not continue throughout as noted above  actuarial standards of practice generally require that the liabilities established for ibnr are sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions 
in many situations  the claims amounts ultimately settled will be less than the estimate that satisfies the actuarial standards of practice 
when this occurs  health benefits expenses incurred during a year  related to prior years  may be reduced 
establishing the liabilities for ibnr  associated with health benefits expenses incurred during a year  related to that current year  at a level sufficient to cover obligations under an assumption of moderately adverse conditions will cause incurred health benefits expenses for that current year to be higher than if ibnr was established without sufficiency for moderately adverse conditions 
also included in medical claims payable are estimates for provider settlements due to clarification of contract terms  out of network reimbursement and claims payment differences  as well as amounts due to contracted providers under risk sharing arrangements 
premium deficiency reserves in addition to incurred but not paid claims  the liability for medical claims payable includes reserves for premium deficiencies  if appropriate 
premium deficiencies are recognized when it is probable that expected claims and administrative expenses will exceed future premiums and investment income on existing medical insurance contracts 
for purposes of premium deficiencies  contracts are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring  servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts 
we did not have any premium deficiency reserves at december  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate our required tax liability based on enacted tax rates  estimates of book to tax differences in income  and projections of income that will be earned in each taxing jurisdiction 
deferred tax assets and liabilities representing the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting net income and taxable income are measured at the tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded 
after tax returns for the applicable year are filed  the estimated tax liability is trued up to the actual liability per the filed federal and state tax returns 
historically  we have not experienced significant differences between our estimates of tax liability and our actual tax liability 
similar to other companies  we sometimes face challenges from the tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
positions taken on our tax returns are evaluated and benefits are recognized only if it is more likely than not that our position will be sustained on audit 
based on our evaluation of tax positions  we believe that we have appropriately accounted for potential tax exposures 
in addition  we are periodically audited by federal and state taxing authorities and these audits can result in proposed assessments 
we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and  as such  will vigorously defend these positions on audit 
we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonable foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
although the ultimate resolution of these audits may require additional tax payments  we do not anticipate any material impact to earnings

see also the recent accounting standards disclosure included in this discussion of critical accounting policies for information on the recently issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
for calendar year companies  fin was effective january  goodwill and intangible assets the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets at acquisition requires assumptions regarding estimated discounted cash flows and market analyses 
these assumptions contain uncertainties because they require management to use judgment in selecting the assumptions and applying the market analyses to the individual acquisitions 
additionally  impairment evaluations require management to use judgment to determine if impairment of goodwill and intangible assets is apparent 
we have applied a consistent methodology in both the original valuation and subsequent impairment evaluations for all goodwill and intangible assets resulting from acquisitions occurring since the adoption fasb statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we do not anticipate any changes to that methodology  nor has any impairment loss resulted from our analyses 
if the assumptions used to evaluate the value of goodwill and intangible assets change in the future  an impairment loss may be recorded and it could be material to our results of operations in the period in which the impairment loss occurs 
recent accounting standards on july   the fasb issued fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
this interpretation provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for a tax benefit to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by applicable taxing authorities 
the benefit recognized is the amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon final settlement of the tax position 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  as a result of the adoption of fin  we recorded a million increase to retained earnings as of january  as of the date of adoption  the total gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits was million excluding interest 
the gross amount of unrecognized tax benefits is million excluding interest as of december  of this total  million net of the federal benefit on state issues represents the total amount of tax benefits that  if recognized  would impact the effective rate 
for further information  please reference note to our audited consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  included in this form k 
in august  the fasb proposed fasb staff position fsp apb a  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
the proposed fsp would require the proceeds from the issuance of such convertible debt instruments to be allocated between a liability component and an equity component 
the resulting debt discount would be amortized over the period the convertible debt is expected to be outstanding as additional non cash interest expense 
the proposed change in accounting treatment would be effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and applied retrospectively to prior periods 
if adopted  this fsp would change the accounting treatment for our million convertible senior notes due may   which were issued effective march  if adopted in its current form  the impact of this new accounting treatment could be significant to our results of operations and result in an increase to non cash interest expense beginning in fiscal year for financial statements covering past and future periods 
we estimate earnings per diluted share could decrease by approximately to annually as a result of the adoption of this fsp 
as the guidance is emerging and still under consideration regarding its effective date and scope  we can make no assurances that the actual impact upon adoption will not differ materially from our estimates 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
revised  business combinations fasb statement no 
r 
fasb statement no 
r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer determines and recognizes in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
fasb statement no 
r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
fasb statement no 
r is effective for any transaction occurring in fiscal years beginning after december   therefore  it will have no impact on our current results of operations and financial condition  however  future acquisitions will be accounted for under this guidance 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating ratios for the years ended december   and all ratios  with the exception of the health benefits ratio  are shown as a percentage of total revenues 
years ended december  premium revenue investment income and other total revenues health benefits selling  general and administrative expenses income before income taxes net income the health benefits ratio is shown as a percentage of premium revenue because there is a direct relationship between the premium received and the health benefits provided

the increase was primarily due to entry into tennessee  expansion regions in georgia and abd expansion in san antonio and austin  texas and the southwest region of ohio 
additionally  our existing products and markets contributed further to revenue growth from premium rate increases and yield increases resulting from changes in membership mix 
total membership increased to  as of december  from  as of december  premium revenue for the year ended december  increased million  or 
the increase was primarily due to entry into the georgia market  commencement of operations as a medicare advantage plan in our houston  texas market and premium rate increases 
total membership increased to  as of december  from  as of december  the following table sets forth the approximate number of our members in each state for the periods presented 
because we receive two premiums for members that are in both the medicare advantage and medicaid products  these members have been counted twice in the states where we offer medicare advantage plans 
december  market texas tennessee georgia florida maryland new york new jersey ohio district of columbia virginia south carolina illinois total included in the texas membership are approximately   and  members under an aso contract in  and  respectively 
included in the tennessee membership are approximately  members under an aso contract in commencing with the mmcc acquisition effective november  as of december   we served approximately  members  which reflects an increase of approximately  members compared to december  our entry into the tennessee market in april resulted in approximately  members at year end 
in addition  the acquisition of mmcc on november   increased our tennessee membership by approximately  members 
the abd expansion markets in texas and ohio  which began enrollment in february  increased membership by approximately  members 
texas membership has further increased as the state of texas eliminated the primary care case management program  which expanded participation in health plans such as ours 
these increases were offset by the contraction of the new york market whose membership decreased by  resulting from more stringent guidelines for eligibility re determination implemented by the state in and a reduction in the size of our new york sales force in response to limits imposed by the state on marketing programs 
additionally  georgia membership decreased by  resulting primarily from a decline in the overall eligible population as well as changes in our marketing programs during the year 
investment income and other increased million or during the year ended december  and million or during the year ended december  these increases in investment income and other are primarily due to higher interest rates and increases in the average balance of invested assets 
additionally  benefited from approximately million in income earned on restricted assets held as collateral 
these assets were established in march and april from proceeds from borrowings under our credit agreement and the issuance of convertible senior notes due may   discussed below 
health benefits expenses relating to health benefits for the year ended december  increased million  or 
the hbr for the year ended december  was compared to in our results compared to reflect an increase in hbr primarily as a result of a higher proportion of our business in developing markets 
these developing markets which include georgia  tennessee  ohio abd  and texas abd as well as maryland medicare advantage  all as of december  generally have a higher hbr than our mature markets due to the introduction of managed care into a previously unmanaged population and the associated start up period required to identify and implement appropriate care management and disease management strategies for the population 
these markets have generally performed at expected levels for the year ended december  expenses relating to health benefits for the year ended december  increased million  or 
the hbr of for the year ended december  improved over that for the year ended december  of as a result of premium rate increases that exceeded medical trend and commencement of medicare advantage operations in our houston  texas market 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million for the year ended december  compared to our sg a ratio for the year ended december  was compared to in the decrease in sg a ratio is primarily a result of leverage gained through increased revenue 
the increase in sg a expenses was primarily due to a growth in salaries and benefits expenses due to a increase in the number of employees  an increase in premium taxes from revenue growth in markets where the tax is levied  and an increase in experience rebate expense in texas driven by two factors an accrual of million associated with the resolution of audit items on all open experience rebate reports for prior years  and the experience rebate expense associated with the favorable operational performance in the state 
sg a increased million for the year ended december  compared to our sg a ratio for the year ended december  was compared to in the increase in sg a ratio was primarily due to an increase in salaries and benefits as a result of a increase in employees  stock compensation expense related to the adoption of fasb statement no 
r and earnings based compensation not provided for in the preceding year  an increase in premium taxes as a result of our entry into the georgia market  increased revenues in our maryland and ohio markets which bear premium tax and an increase in the premium tax rate in new jersey  an increase in legal expenses related to the qui tam litigation  and an increase in operational and technological initiatives and recruiting expenses to support the company s growth 
premium taxes were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase from to is a result of greater depreciable assets  the write off of debt issuance costs related to the termination of the company s previous million credit agreement and an increase in amortization of debt issuance costs as a result of the new credit agreement entered into in march interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december  and million in each of the years ended december  and the increase in interest expense is a result of borrowings under our credit agreement and the issuance of the convertible senior notes due may   discussed below 
provision for income taxes income tax expense for and was million and million  respectively  with an effective tax rate of in and in income tax expense for was million with an effective tax rate of 
the decrease in effective tax rate from to is primarily a result of the decrease in the blended state income tax rate 
the effective tax rate remained unchanged between and as the increase in the blended state income tax rate was offset by increases in federal tax exempt interest income 
net income net income for was million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share in net income for was million or per diluted share 
net income increased from to as a result of growth in total revenues associated with geographic expansion  membership increases  premium rate increases and investment income increases limiting the increase in hbr  and reducing sg a as a percentage of revenues 
net income increased from to as a result of actuarially sound premium rate increases in excess of medical trend  favorable prior period development and commencement of operation as a medicare advantage plan in texas 
liquidity and capital resources we manage our cash  investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short and long term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity 
we forecast  analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable prudent investment management and financing within the confines of our financial strategy 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit agreement 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  short and long term investments of million and restricted investments on deposit for licensure of million 
cash  cash equivalents  and investments which are unrestricted and unregulated totaled million at december  we believe that existing cash and investment balances  internally generated funds and available funds under our credit agreement will be sufficient to support continuing operations  capital expenditures and our growth strategy for at least months 
our debt to total capital ratio at december  was 
as a result of significant borrowings under the credit agreement and the related debt service and issuance of the convertible senior notes  our access to additional capital may be limited which could restrict our ability to acquire new businesses or enter new markets and could impact our ability to maintain statutory net worth requirements in the states in which we do business 
our operations are conducted through our wholly owned subsidiaries  which include hmos  one hic and one phsp 
hmos  hics and phsps are subject to state regulations that  among other things  require the maintenance of minimum levels of statutory capital  as defined by each state  and restrict the timing  payment and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their stockholders 
additionally  certain state regulatory agencies may require individual regulated entities to maintain statutory capital levels higher than the state regulations 
as of december   we believe our subsidiaries were in compliance with all minimum statutory capital requirements 
we anticipate the parent company will be required to fund minimum net worth shortfalls during using unregulated cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we believe as a result that we will continue to be in compliance with these requirements at least through the end of the national association of insurance commissioners naic has defined risk based capital rbc standards for hmos and other entities bearing risk for healthcare coverage that are designed to identify weakly capitalized companies by comparing each company s adjusted surplus to its required surplus rbc ratio 
the rbc ratio is designed to reflect the risk profile of hmos 
within certain ratio ranges  regulators have increasing authority to take action as the rbc ratio decreases 
there are four levels of regulatory action  ranging from requiring insurers to submit a comprehensive plan to the state insurance commissioner to requiring the state insurance commissioner to place the insurer under regulatory control 
at december   the rbc ratio of each of the company s health plans was at or above the level that would require regulatory action 
although not all states had adopted these rules at december   at that date  each of the company s active health plans had a surplus that exceeded either the applicable state net worth requirements or  where adopted  the levels that would require regulatory action under the naic s rbc rules 
cash and investments cash from operations was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in cash from operations is primarily due to an increase in net income prior to depreciation  amortization and other noncash items of million as well as an increase of approximately million in cash flows generated from working capital changes 
we generated operating cash flows from working capital changes of million in and million in the year over year increase primarily resulted from an increase in claims payable of million driven by growth of the business  offset by an increase in premium receivables and a decline in the growth of accounts payable  accrued expenses and other current liabilities between the years 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  this increase in cash used in investing activities results primarily from net purchases of restricted investments held as collateral of million to fund the irrevocable letter of credit required to stay the execution of the judgment in the qui tam litigation and net purchases of hedge and warrant instruments of million offset by lower net investment purchases of million 
we currently anticipate total capital expenditures for of approximately million to million related to technological infrastructure development and the expansion of our medical management system 
our investment policies are designed to provide liquidity  preserve capital and maximize total return on invested assets 
as of december   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities 
the weighted average maturity is less than twelve months 
we utilize investment vehicles such as money market funds  commercial paper  certificates of deposit  municipal bonds  debt securities of government sponsored entities  corporate securities  corporate bonds  auction rate securities and us treasury instruments 
the states in which we operate prescribe the types of instruments in which our subsidiaries may invest their cash 
the weighted average taxable equivalent yield on consolidated investments as of december  was approximately 
as of december   million of our million in short term investments were comprised of municipal notes investments with an auction reset feature auction rate securities 
these notes are issued by various state and local municipal entities for the purpose of financing student loans  public projects and other activities  they carry a aaa credit rating 
subsequent to december  all of the million of auction rate securities that we held at the balance sheet date were either sold or had their interest rate reset through a successful auction 
as of february   million of our investments were comprised of auction rate securities 
liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process which allows holders to sell their notes and resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually every or days 
as of february   auctions had failed for million of our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell their securities could not be matched with an adequate volume of buyers 
in the event that there is a failed auction the indenture governing the security requires the issuer to pay interest at a contractually defined rate that is generally above market rates for other types of similar short term instruments 
the securities for which auctions have failed will continue to accrue interest at the contractual rate and be auctioned every or days until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as a result  our ability to liquidate and fully recover the carrying value of our remaining auction rate securities in the near term may be limited or not exist 
these developments may result in the classification of some or all of these securities as long term investments in our consolidated financial statements for the first quarter of or in other future periods 
in addition  while all of our auction rate securities are currently rated aaa  if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our auction rate securities without significant loss  and we currently believe these securities are not impaired  primarily due to government guarantees or municipal bond insurance  however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying securities to realize our investments recorded value 
the final maturity of the underlying securities could be as long as years 
the weighted average life of the underlying securities for our auction rate securities portfolio is years 
we currently have the ability and intent to hold the remaining million of auction rate securities  until market stability is restored with respect to these securities 
we believe that  even allowing for the reclassification of these securities to long term and the possible requirement to hold all such securities for an indefinite period of time  our remaining cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to support continuing operations  capital expenditures and our growth strategies 
cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to proceeds received from the issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes and borrowings under the credit agreement of million net of repayments of outstanding amounts under the credit agreement of million and payment of debt issuance costs of million 
financing activities credit agreement on march   we entered in to a credit agreement which provides  among other things  for commitments of up to million consisting of i up to million of financing under a senior secured synthetic letter of credit facility and ii up to million of financing under a senior secured revolving credit facility 
the credit agreement terminates on march  we initially borrowed million under the senior secured synthetic letter of credit facility of the credit agreement 
shortly thereafter  we repaid million of such borrowings with the proceeds from the issuance of the convertible senior notes 
as a result  pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  unless later amended by the parties  the commitments under the senior secured synthetic letter of credit facility were permanently reduced to million and total commitments under the credit agreement were permanently reduced to million 
the proceeds of the credit agreement are available to i facilitate an appeal  payment or settlement of the judgment in the qui tam litigation as defined below  ii repay in full certain existing indebtedness  iii pay related transaction costs  fees  commissions and expenses  and iv provide for the ongoing working capital requirements and general corporate purposes  including permitted acquisitions 
the borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest at our option at a percentage  per annum  equal to the adjusted eurodollar rate plus or the base rate plus 
we are required to make payments of interest in arrears on each interest payment date to be determined depending on interest period elections made by the company and at maturity of the loans  including final maturity thereof 
the applicable interest rate was at december  the credit agreement includes customary covenants and events of default 
if any event of default occurs and is continuing  the credit agreement may be terminated and all amounts owing there under may become immediately due and payable 
the credit agreement also includes the following financial covenants i maximum leverage ratios as of specified periods  ii a minimum interest coverage ratio and iii a minimum statutory net worth ratio 
borrowings under the credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our wholly owned subsidiary  php holdings  inc  including a pledge of the stock of each of our respective wholly owned managed care subsidiaries  in each case  subject to carve outs 
as of december   we had million outstanding under the senior secured synthetic letter of credit facility of our credit agreement 
these funds are held in restricted investments as partial collateral for an irrevocable letter of credit in the amount of million  issued to the clerk of court for the us district court for the northern district of illinois  eastern division 
the irrevocable letter of credit was provided to the court for the purpose of staying the enforcement of the judgment in the qui tam litigation pending resolution of our appeal 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings but have caused to be issued irrevocable letters of credit in the aggregate face amount of million under the senior secured revolving credit facility of our credit agreement 
we incurred offering expenses totaling million in connection with the credit agreement which are included in other long term assets in the condensed consolidated financial statements and are being amortized over the term of the credit agreement 
convertible senior notes effective march   we issued an aggregate of million in principal amount of convertible senior notes due may  the notes 
in may  we filed an automatic shelf registration statement on form s with the sec covering the resale of the notes and common stock issuable upon conversion of the notes 
the total proceeds from the offering of the notes  after deducting underwriting fees and estimated offering expenses  were approximately million 
we incurred offering expenses totaling million in connection with the offering of the notes which are included in other long term assets in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and are being amortized over the term of the notes 
as of december   approximately million of these proceeds plus million funded by the company  are held as restricted investments as the balance of the collateral required for the irrevocable letter of credit which totals million  as discussed above 
the remainder of the proceeds of the notes were used in connection with the purchase of convertible note hedges and sold warrants that were established concurrent with the issuance of the notes as discussed below 
the notes are governed by an indenture dated as of march  the indenture 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations of the company and will rank equally with all of our existing and future senior debt and senior to all of our subordinated debt 
the notes will be effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries and to any existing and future secured indebtedness  including the obligations under our credit agreement 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable semiannually in arrears in cash on may and november of each year  beginning on may  the notes mature on may   unless earlier repurchased or converted 
holders may convert their notes at their option on any day prior to the close of business on the scheduled trading day immediately preceding march   only under the following circumstances during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period the measurement period in which the price per note for each day of that measurement period was less than percent of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such day  during any calendar quarter after the calendar quarter ending june   if the last reported sale price of our common stock for or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of our immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds percent of the applicable conversion price in effect on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter  or upon the occurrence of specified corporate events 
the notes will be convertible  regardless of the foregoing circumstances  at any time on or after march  through the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date of the notes  may  upon conversion of the notes  we will pay cash up to the principal amount of the notes converted 
with respect to any conversion value in excess of the principal amount of the notes converted  we have the option to settle the excess with cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock based on a daily conversion value  as defined in the indenture 
if an accounting event as defined in the indenture occurs  we have the option to elect to settle the converted notes exclusively in shares of our common stock 
the initial conversion rate for the notes will be shares of common stock per one thousand dollars of principal amount of notes  which represents a percent conversion premium based on the closing price of per share of our common stock on march  and is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share of common stock 
the conversion rate is subject to adjustment in some events but will not be adjusted for accrued interest 
in addition  if a fundamental change as defined in the indenture occurs prior to the maturity date  we will in some cases increase the conversion rate for a holder of notes that elects to convert its notes in connection with such fundamental change 
subject to certain exceptions  if we undergo a designated event as defined in the indenture holders of the notes will have the option to require us to repurchase all or any portion of their notes 
the designated event repurchase price will be of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest including special interest  if any up to but excluding the designated event repurchase date 
we will pay cash for all notes so repurchased 
we may not redeem the notes prior to maturity 
concurrent with the issuance of the notes  we purchased convertible note hedges covering  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments   shares of our common stock 
the convertible note hedges allow us to receive shares of our common stock and or cash equal to the amounts of common stock and or cash related to the excess conversion value that we would pay to the holders of the notes upon conversion 
these convertible note hedges will terminate at the earlier of the maturity dates of the notes or the first day on which none of the notes remain outstanding due to conversion or otherwise 
the cost of the convertible note hedges aggregated approximately million 
the convertible note hedges are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes in the event that the market value per share of our common stock  as measured under the convertible note hedges  at the time of exercise is greater than the strike price of the convertible note hedges  which corresponds to the initial conversion price of the notes and is subject to certain customary adjustments 
if  however  the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants discussed below when such warrants are exercised  we will be required to issue common stock 
both the convertible note hedges and warrants provide for net share settlement at the time of any exercise for the amount that the market value of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price 
also concurrent with the issuance of the notes  we sold warrants to acquire  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
if the average price of our common stock during a defined period ending on or about the settlement date exceeds the exercise price of the warrants  the warrants will be settled  at our option  in cash or shares of our common stock 
proceeds received from the issuance of the warrants totaled approximately million 
the convertible note hedges and sold warrants are separate transactions which will not affect holders rights under the notes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had short term investments of million  long term investments of million and investments on deposit for licensure of million 
these investments consist of debt securities with maturities between three months and thirty three years 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
credit risk is managed by investing in highly rated securities which include us treasury securities  debt securities of government sponsored entities  municipal bonds  commercial paper  auction rate securities  corporate securities  corporate bonds and money market funds 
our investment policies are subject to revision based upon market conditions and our cash flow and tax strategies  among other factors 
we have the ability to hold these investments to maturity  and as a result  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change in market interest rates 
as of december   a hypothetical change in interest rates would result in an approximate million change in our annual investment income or change in diluted earnings per share 
we also have interest rate risk from changing interest rates related to our outstanding debt under the credit agreement 
as of december   we had million of eurodollar based floating rate debt outstanding under the credit agreement 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by million or per diluted share net of the related income tax effect
