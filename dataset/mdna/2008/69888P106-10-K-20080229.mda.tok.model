these efforts resulted in new product introductions in  including propranolol hcl extended release er capsules  which is an outcome of the company s strategic partnership with nortec development associates  inc  ranitidine hcl syrup  pursuant to a supply and distribution agreement with gsk and the launch of metoprolol succinate er mg in the fourth quarter of and additional strengths mg  mg  and mg in the third quarter  pursuant to a supply and distribution agreement with astrazeneca az 
additionally  in accordance with the development  sales  marketing and supply agreement with barr  the company receives royalties from the sales of ondansetron tablets  which launched in the fourth quarter of in  the company s efforts resulted in higher sales from new product introductions  including fluticasone pursuant to a supply and distribution agreement with gsk  several other products pursuant to agreements with teva  ivax  and orchid chemicals pharmaceuticals ltd 
including amoxicillin products and cefprozil  and the launch of cabergoline in december of the company s business plan includes developing and marketing branded drugs as part of its effort to add products with longer life cycles and higher profitability to the company s product line 
in july  the company received fda approval for its first new drug application nda  filed pursuant to section b of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  and immediately began marketing megestrol acetate oral suspension nanocrystal dispersion megace es 
megace es is indicated for the treatment of anorexia  cachexia or any unexplained significant weight loss in patients with a diagnosis of aids and is utilizing the megace brand name that the company has licensed from bristol myers squibb company bms 
in september  the company entered into an extended reach agreement with solvay pharmaceuticals  inc solvay that provides for the company s branded sales force to co promote androgel  as well as future versions of the product or other products that are mutually agreed upon  for a period of six years 
as compensation for its marketing and sales efforts  the company will receive million annually  paid quarterly  for the six year period 
the company has progressed on its business plan during by acquiring the rights to additional branded products currently in phase iii clinical trials 
in july  the company also acquired an exclusive licensing agreement under which the company will receive commercialization rights in the us to bioalliance pharma s loramyc miconazole lauriad  an antifungal therapy for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis  an opportunistic infection commonly found in immunocompromised patients  including those with hiv and cancer 
in august  the company also acquired the north american commercial rights to zensana tm ondansetron hcl oral spray from hana biosciences  inc hana

the company had paid a million licensing fee to acquire the us commercialization rights from immtech in june in january  the company announced that it entered into an exclusive licensing agreement with alfacell corporation alfacell to acquire the commercialization rights in the united states and its territories for onconase ranpirnase

for additional information on these agreements and other similar matters  refer to notes to consolidated financial statements note research and development agreements and note subsequent events 
in addition to the substantial costs of product development  the company may incur significant legal costs in bringing certain products to market 
litigation concerning patents and proprietary rights is often protracted and expensive 
pharmaceutical companies with patented brand products are increasingly suing companies that produce generic forms of their patented brand name products for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights  which could delay or prevent the entry of such generic products into the market 
generally  a generic drug may not be marketed until the applicable patent s on the brand name drug expires 
when an anda is filed with the fda for approval of a generic drug  the filing person may certify either that the patent listed by the fda as covering the branded product is about to expire  in which case the anda will not become effective until the expiration of such patent  or that the patent listed as covering the branded drug is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture  sale or use of the new drug for which the anda is filed 
in either case  there is a risk that a branded pharmaceutical company may sue the filing person for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
because a substantial portion of the company s current business involves the marketing and development of generic versions of brand products  the threat of litigation  the outcome of which is inherently uncertain  is always present 
such litigation is often costly and time consuming  and could result in a substantial delay in  or prevent  the introduction and or marketing of products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  prospects and results of operations 
sales and gross margins of the company s products depend principally on the i introduction of other generic drug manufacturers products in direct competition with the company s significant products  ii ability of generic competitors to quickly enter the market after patent or exclusivity period expirations  or during exclusivity periods with authorized generic products  diminishing the amount and duration of significant profits to the company from any one product  iii pricing practices of competitors and the removal of competing products from the market  iv continuation of existing distribution agreements  v introduction of new distributed products  vi consolidation among distribution outlets through mergers  acquisitions and the formation of buying groups  vii willingness of generic drug customers  including wholesale and retail customers  to switch among generic pharmaceutical manufacturers  viii approval of andas  introduction of new manufactured products  and future new product launches  ix granting of potential marketing exclusivity periods  x extent of market penetration for the existing product line  xi level  quality and amount of customer service  and xii market acceptance of the company s recently introduced branded product and the successful development to commercialization of the company s in licensed branded product pipeline 
the company divested finetech effective december  and  as such  its results are being reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented see notes to consolidated financial statements note discontinued operations related party transaction

sfas r is being applied on the modified prospective basis 
prior to its adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for its stock based compensation plans in accordance with provisions of apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  as permitted by sfas prior to  compensation costs related to stock options granted at fair value under those plans were not recognized in the consolidated statements of operations

the following table shows the revenues  gross margin  and operating income by segment for the years ended december    and revenues generic brand total revenues gross margin generic brand total gross margin operating income loss generic brand total operating income loss total revenues and gross margin dollars increased  or and  or  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in for the year ended december   the company s total revenues and gross margin dollars increased  or and  or  respectively  when compared to generic revenues and gross margin dollars increased  or and  or  respectively  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in generic revenues and gross margin dollars increased  or and  or  respectively  for the year ended december  from the year ended december  increased generic sales in were primarily due to product introductions including metoprolol succinate er mg  mg  mg  and mg  propranolol hcl er caps and ranitidine hcl syrup  and royalties earned related to the sales of ondansetron tablets  which launched in the fourth quarter of these increases were partially offset by lower sales of existing products including fluticasone  various amoxicillin products  quinapril  cefprozil  tramadol hc and acetaminophen tablets  lovastatin  paroxetine  fluoxetine and glyburide metformin 
the increase in generic gross margin was primarily due to the introduction of new product launches including propranolol hcl er and metoprolol succinate er  royalties earned from the sales of ondansetron tablets  which launched in the fourth quarter of  and lower inventory write offs for the year ended december  compared with the same period in branded revenues and gross margin dollars for the year ended december  increased  or and  or  respectively  driven by increased sales of megace es and fees received related to the co promotion of androgel 
brand revenues and gross margin dollars for the year ended december  increased  or and  or  respectively  primarily due to the july launch of megace es 
net sales and gross margins derived from generic pharmaceutical products often follow a pattern based on regulatory and competitive factors that are believed by the company s management to be unique to the generic pharmaceutical industry 
as the patent s for a brand name product and the related exclusivity period s expire  the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval from the fda for a generic equivalent of the product is often able to capture a substantial share of the market 
at that time  however  the branded company may license an authorized generic product to a competing generic company 
as additional generic manufacturers receive regulatory approvals for competing products  the market share and the price of that product have typically declined  often significantly  depending on several factors  including the number of competitors  the price of the brand product and the pricing strategy of the new competitors 
operating income from the generic business was impacted in by the sales and gross margins discussed above  including a reduction in inventory write offs of  driven by improved inventory management and the non recurrence of the write off of pre launch inventories  related to the delayed launch of clonidine  as well as by increased investment in generic research and development projects  and costs associated with the company s tender offer for certain eligible unvested stock options  see notes to consolidated financial statements note share based compensation  partially offset by the non recurrence of the write off of invalid customer deductions

generic drug pricing at the wholesale level can create significant differences between the invoice price and the company s net selling price 
wholesale customers purchase product from the company at invoice price  then resell the product to specific healthcare providers on the basis of prices negotiated between the company and the providers  and the wholesaler submits a chargeback credit to the company for the difference 
the company records estimates for these chargebacks  sales returns  rebates and incentive programs  and other sales allowances  for all its customers at the time of sale  as reductions to gross revenues  with corresponding adjustments to its accounts receivable reserves and allowances 
the company s gross revenues before deductions for chargebacks  rebates and incentive programs including rebates paid under federal and state government medicaid drug reimbursement programs  sales returns and other sales allowances were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  deductions from gross revenues were  in and  in these deductions are discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements note accounts receivable 
the total gross to net sales adjustments as a percentage of gross sales decreased to in compared to in  primarily due to a decrease in wholesaler acquisition costs in  less price competition for new products  higher sales of megace es  lower non expiry returns  and higher royalties and co promotion fees in  which are not impacted by deductions  tempered by pricing pressure for certain existing products

the top selling products that did not have sales in the prior year were fluticasone and various amoxicillin products 
the company recognizes revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred to its customers when reliable estimates of rebates  chargebacks  returns and other adjustments can be made  and when collectibility is reasonably assured

critical accounting policies and use of estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s most critical accounting policies  as discussed below  pertain to revenue recognition and the determination of deductions from gross revenues  the determination of whether certain costs pertaining to the company s significant development and marketing agreements are to be capitalized or expensed as incurred  the valuation and assessment of impairment of intangible assets  the determination of depreciable and amortizable lives and issues related to legal proceedings 
in applying such policies  management often must use amounts that are based on its informed judgments and estimates 
because of the uncertainties inherent in these estimates  actual results could differ from the estimates used in applying the critical accounting policies 
the company is not aware of any likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect its financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition and provisions for deductions from gross revenues the company recognizes revenues for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred to its customers  when reliable estimates of rebates  chargebacks  returns and other adjustments can be made  and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
this is generally at the time products are received by the customers 
upon recognizing revenue from sales  the company records estimates for the following items that reduce gross revenues chargebacks rebates and incentive programs product returns cash discounts and other medicaid rebates the following table summarizes the activity for the years ended december   and in the accounts affected by the estimated provisions described below  in thousands for the year ended december  accounts receivable reserves beginning balance provision recorded for current period sales provision reversal recorded for prior period sales credits processed ending balance chargebacks rebates and incentive programs returns cash discounts and other total accrued liabilities for the year ended december  accounts receivable reserves beginning balance provision recorded for current period sales provision reversal recorded for prior period sales credits processed ending balance chargebacks rebates and incentive programs returns cash discounts and other total accrued liabilities for the year ended december  accounts receivable reserves beginning balance provision recorded for current period sales provision reversal recorded for prior period sales credits processed ending balance chargebacks rebates and incentive programs returns cash discounts and other total accrued liabilities the amount of provision or reversal of reserves related to prior periods for chargebacks is not determinable on a product or customer specific basis  however  based upon historical analysis and analysis of activity in subsequent periods  the company has determined that its chargeback estimates remain reasonable 
includes amounts due to customers for which no underlying accounts receivable exists  including medicaid rebates 
restated to reflect a reclassification to accrued expenses of million for discounts due to customers for which no underlying accounts receivable existed as of december  the company sells its products directly to wholesalers  retail drug store chains  drug distributors  mail order pharmacies and other direct purchasers and customers that purchase its products indirectly through the wholesalers  including independent pharmacies  non warehousing retail drug store chains  managed health care providers and other indirect purchasers 
the company has entered into agreements at negotiated contract prices with those health care providers that purchase products through the company s wholesale customers at those contract prices 
chargeback credits are issued to wholesalers for the difference between the company s invoice price to the wholesaler and the contract price through which the product is resold to health care providers 
approximately and of the company s net product sales were derived from the wholesale distribution channel for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the information that the company considers when establishing its chargeback reserves includes contract and non contract sales trends  average historical contract pricing  actual price changes  processing time lags and customer inventory information from its three largest wholesale customers 
the company s chargeback provision and related reserve vary with changes in product mix  changes in customer pricing and changes to estimated wholesaler inventory 
customer rebates and incentive programs are generally provided to customers as an incentive for the customers to continue to carry the company s products or replace competing products in their distribution channels with those products sold by the company 
rebate programs are based on a customer s dollar purchases made during an applicable monthly  quarterly or annual period 
the company also provides indirect rebates  which are rebates paid to indirect customers that have purchased our products from a wholesaler under a contract with the company 
the incentive programs include stocking or trade show promotions where additional discounts may be given on a new product or certain existing products as an added incentive to stock the company s products 
the company may  from time to time  also provide price and or volume incentives on new products that have multiple competitors and or on existing products that confront new competition in order to attempt to secure or maintain a certain market share 
the information that the company considers when establishing its rebate and incentive program reserves are rebate agreements with and purchases by each customer  tracking and analysis of promotional offers  projected annual sales for customers with annual incentive programs  actual rebates and incentive payments made  processing time lags  and for indirect rebates  the level of inventory in the distribution channel that will be subject to indirect rebates 
the company does not provide incentives designed to increase shipments to its customers that it believes would result in out of the ordinary course of business inventory for them 
the company regularly reviews and monitors estimated or actual customer inventory information at its three largest wholesale customers for its key products to ascertain whether customer inventories are in excess of ordinary course of business levels 
pursuant to a drug rebate agreement with the centers for medicare and medicaid services and similar supplemental agreements with various states  the company provides such states with a rebate on drugs dispensed under the medicaid program 
the company determines its estimate of medicaid rebate accrual primarily based on historical experience of claims submitted by the various states and any new information regarding changes in the medicaid program that might impact the company s provision for medicaid rebates 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount the company considers historical payment rates  processing lag for outstanding claims and payments and levels of inventory in the distribution channel 
the company reviews the accrual and assumptions on a quarterly basis against actual claims data to help ensure that the estimates made are reliable 
the company accepts returns of product according to the following criteria i the product returns must be approved by authorized personnel in writing or by telephone with the lot number and expiration date accompanying any request and ii the company generally will accept returns of products from any customer and will provide the customer with a credit memo for such returns if such products are returned within six months prior to  and until months following  such products expiration date 
the company records a provision for product returns based on historical experience  including actual rate of expired and damaged returns  average remaining shelf lives of products sold  which generally range from to months  and estimated return dates 
additionally the company considers other factors when estimating its current period return provision  including levels of inventory in the distribution channel  significant market changes that may impact future expected returns  and actual product returns and may record additional provisions for specific returns that it believes are not covered by the historical rates 
the company offers cash discounts to its customers  generally of the sales price  as an incentive for paying within invoice terms  which generally range from to days 
the company accounts for cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts that the company expects its customers to take 
in addition to the significant gross to net sales adjustments described above  the company periodically makes other sales adjustments 
the company generally accounts for these other gross to net adjustments by establishing an accrual in the amount equal to its estimate of the adjustments attributable to the sale 
the company may at its discretion provide price adjustments due to various competitive factors  through shelf stock adjustments on customers existing inventory levels 
there are circumstances under which the company may not provide price adjustments to certain customers and consequently  as a matter of business strategy  may lose future sales volume to competitors rather than reduce its pricing 
as detailed above  the company has the experience and access to relevant information that it believes are necessary to reasonably estimate the amounts of such deductions from gross revenues 
some of the assumptions used by the company for certain of its estimates are based on information received from third parties  such as wholesale customer inventories and market data  or other market factors beyond the company s control 
the estimates that are most critical to the establishment of these reserves  and therefore  would have the largest impact if these estimates were not accurate  are estimates related to contract sales volumes  average contract pricing  customer inventories and return volumes 
the company regularly reviews the information related to these estimates and adjusts its reserves accordingly  if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates 
with the exception of the product returns allowance  the ending balances of accounts receivable reserves and allowances generally are processed during a two month to four month period 
use of estimates in reserves the company believes that its reserves  allowances and accruals for items that are deducted from gross revenues are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
it is possible  however  that other parties applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different allowance and accrual amounts for items that are deducted from gross revenues 
additionally  changes in actual experience or changes in other qualitative factors could cause the company s allowances and accruals to fluctuate  particularly with newly launched or acquired products 
the company reviews the rates and amounts in its allowance and accrual estimates on a quarterly basis 
if future estimated rates and amounts are significantly greater than those reflected in its recorded reserves  the resulting adjustments to those reserves would decrease the company s reported net revenues  conversely  if actual product returns  rebates and chargebacks are significantly less than those reflected in its recorded reserves  the resulting adjustments to those reserves would increase its reported net revenues 
if the company were to change its assumptions and estimates  its reserves would change  which would impact the net revenues that the company reports 
the company regularly reviews the information related to these estimates and adjusts its reserves accordingly  if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates 
research and development agreements the company capitalizes or expenses amounts related to the development of new products and technologies through agreements with third parties based on the company s determination of its ability to recover in a reasonable period of time its cost from the estimated future cash flows anticipated to be generated pursuant to each agreement 
accordingly  amounts related to the company s funding of the research and development efforts of others or to the purchase of contractual rights to products that have not been approved by the fda  and where the company has no alternative future use for the product  are expensed and included in research and development costs 
amounts for contractual rights acquired by the company to a process  product or other legal right having multiple or alternative future uses that support its realizability  as well as to an approved product  are capitalized and included in intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill and intangible assets the company determines the estimated fair values of goodwill and certain intangible assets with definitive lives based on valuations performed by the company at the time of their acquisition in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  the fair value of certain amounts paid to third parties related to the development of new products and technologies  as described above  are capitalized and included in intangible assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually  or when events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
intangible assets are reviewed quarterly  or when events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is determined to exist when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the net assets being tested 
impairment of definite lived intangibles is determined to exist when undiscounted cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the assets being tested 
as discussed above with respect to determining an asset s fair value and useful life  because this process involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates form the basis of the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded  these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates 
as of december   the company determined through its estimates that no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets existed 
the company will continue to assess the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
as discussed in notes to consolidated financial statements note intangible assets  the company impaired intangible assets of  in as a result of the acquisition of kali in  the company had amounts recorded as goodwill of  at december  and december  in addition  intangible assets with definite lives  net of accumulated amortization  totaled  and  respectively  at december  and recent accounting pronouncements that may have a material impact on future consolidated financial statements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified emerging issue task force issue no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk available for sale debt securities the primary objectives for the company s investment portfolio are liquidity and safety of principal 
investments are made with the intention to achieve the best available rate of return on traditionally low risk investments 
the company s investment policy limits investments to certain types of instruments issued by institutions with investment grade credit ratings  the us government and us governmental agencies 
the company is subject to market risk primarily from changes in the fair values of its investments in debt securities including governmental agency securities and auction rate securities 
these instruments are classified as available for sale securities for financial reporting purposes 
a increase in interest rates would cause the fair value of the company s investments in available for sale debt securities to decline by approximately million 
additional investments are made in overnight deposits and money market funds 
these instruments are classified as cash and cash equivalents for financial reporting purposes  and generally also have lower interest rate risk relative to its investments in debt securities and changes in interest rates generally have little or no impact on their fair values 
for cash  cash equivalents and available for sale debt securities  a percent decrease in interest rates would decrease interest income by approximately million 
the company does not have any financial obligations exposed to variability in interest rates 
the following table summarizes the available for sale securities that subject the company to market risk as of december  and december  december  securities issued by government agencies debt securities issued by various state and local municipalities and agencies other debt securities marketable equity securities available for sale auction rate securities total marketable equity securities available for sale in addition to the investments described above  the company is also subject to market risk in respect to its investment in hana

the company recorded an unrealized loss of million for the year ended december   which was included in other comprehensive income to reflect the estimated fair value of its investment in hana 
a adverse change in the market price of hana common stock would impact the fair value of the investment by approximately million
