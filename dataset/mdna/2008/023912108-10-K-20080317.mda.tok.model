item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion highlights the significant factors affecting amcore financial  inc and subsidiaries amcore or the company consolidated financial condition as of december  compared to december   and the consolidated results of operations for the three years ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report 
factors influencing forward looking statements this report on form k contains  and periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission and written or oral statements made by the company s officers and directors to the press  potential investors  securities analysts and others will contain  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities act of  and the company intends that such forward looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created thereby with respect to  among other things  the financial condition  results of operations  plans  objectives  future performance and business of amcore 
statements that are not historical facts  including statements about beliefs and expectations  are forward looking statements 
these statements are based upon beliefs and assumptions of amcore s management and on information currently available to such management 
the use of the words believe  expect  anticipate  plan  estimate  should  may  will  or similar expressions identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made  and amcore undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements in light of new information or future events 
contemplated  projected  forecasted or estimated results in such forward looking statements involve certain inherent risks and uncertainties 
a number of factors many of which are beyond the ability of the company to control or predict could cause actual results to differ materially from those in its forward looking statements 
these factors include  among others  the following possibilities i heightened competition  including specifically the intensification of price competition  the entry of new competitors and the formation of new products by new or existing competitors  ii adverse state  local and federal legislation and regulation or adverse findings or rulings made by local  state or federal regulators or agencies regarding amcore and its operations  iii failure to obtain new customers and retain existing customers  iv inability to carry out marketing and or expansion plans  v ability to attract and retain key executives or personnel  vi changes in interest rates including the effect of prepayments  vii general economic and business conditions which are less favorable than expected  viii equity and fixed income market fluctuations  ix unanticipated changes in industry trends  x unanticipated changes in credit quality and risk factors  xi success in gaining regulatory approvals when required  xii changes in federal reserve board monetary policies  xiii unexpected outcomes on existing or new litigation in which amcore  its subsidiaries  officers  directors or employees are named defendants  xiv technological changes  xv changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  xvi changes in assumptions or conditions affecting the application of critical accounting estimates  xvii inability of third party vendors to perform critical services for the company or its customers  xviii disruption of operations caused by the conversion and installation of data processing systems  and xix zoning restrictions or other limitations at the local level  which could prevent limited branch offices from transitioning to full service facilities 
critical accounting estimates and accounting changes critical accounting estimates the financial condition and results of operations for amcore presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  selected financial data appearing elsewhere within this report  and management s discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon 
table of contents the company s accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below are discussions of those accounting policies that management believes require its most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain critical accounting estimates and are most important to the portrayal and understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different portrayal of financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood

allowance for loan losses loans  the company s largest income earning asset category  are periodically evaluated by management in order to establish an adequate allowance for loan losses allowance to absorb estimated losses that are probable as of the respective reporting date 
this evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed loans where it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all of the amounts due principal or interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement impaired loans and statistical loss estimates for loan groups or pools that are based on historical loss experience 
also included are other loss estimates that reflect the current credit environment and that are not otherwise captured in the historical loss rates 
these include the quality and concentration characteristics of the various loan portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  and economic and industry conditions  among other things 
the allowance is also subject to periodic examination by regulators  whose review may include their own assessment as to its adequacy to absorb probable losses 
additions to the allowance are charged against earnings for the period as a provision for loan losses provision 
conversely  this evaluation could result in a decrease in the allowance and provision 
actual loan losses are charged against and reduce the allowance when management believes that the collection of principal will not occur 
unpaid interest attributable to prior years for loans that are placed on non accrual status is also charged against and reduces the allowance 
unpaid interest for the current year for loans that are placed on non accrual status is charged against and reduces the interest income previously recognized 
subsequent recoveries of amounts previously charged to the allowance  if any  are credited to and increase the allowance 
those judgments and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are the initial and on going creditworthiness of the borrower  the amount and timing of future cash flows of the borrower that are available for repayment of the loan  the sufficiency of underlying collateral  the enforceability of third party guarantees  the frequency and subjectivity of loan reviews and risk gradings  emerging or changing trends that might not be fully captured in the historical loss experience  and charges against the allowance for actual losses that are greater or less than previously estimated 
these judgments and assumptions are dependent upon or can be influenced by a variety of factors including the breadth and depth of experience of lending officers  credit administration and the corporate loan review staff that periodically review the status of the loan  changing economic and industry conditions  changes in the financial condition of the borrower and changes in the value and availability of the underlying collateral and guarantees 
while the company strives to timely reflect all known risk factors in its evaluations  judgment errors may occur 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the amount and timing of interest income and loan losses could be materially different 
these factors are most pronounced during economic downturns and may continue into an economic recovery  as specific credit performance may not be immediately affected by the stress of the downturn or the benefit of the recovery 
since  as described above  so many factors can affect the amount and timing of losses on loans  it is difficult to predict with a high degree of certainty the effect to income if different conditions or assumptions were to prevail 
nonetheless  if any combination of the above judgments or assumptions were to have adversely affected the adequacy of the allowance by ten percent during  an additional provision of million may have been necessary

table of contents mortgage servicing rights the company sells most of the one to four family residential real estate loans that it originates 
historically  these were primarily sold to the federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc  a us government sponsored enterprise gse 
gains recorded on the sale of the loans included the right to service the loans on behalf of fhlmc  a right that was retained by the company  and that resulted in an originated mortgage servicing rights the omsr asset 
the resulting omsr asset was amortized as a charge against mortgage banking income in proportion to the principal amortization of the underlying serviced loans and as the actual servicing fee was collected 
each reporting period  the company re evaluated the fair value of its remaining omsr asset to determine whether or not the asset was impaired and needed to be written down to fair value or had recovered in value from a previous impairment write down requiring a reversal of the previous impairment write down 
the initial omsr gains  any subsequent impairment write downs and impairment write down reversals  resulted in a high degree of volatility in mortgage banking income 
the amortization of the omsr asset largely offset actual servicing fees collected 
the initial valuation and periodic re evaluation of omsr fair value incorporated numerous judgments and assumptions including the cost of servicing the loans  discount rates  prepayment rates and default rates 
these judgments and assumptions  along with the earnings volatility  resulted in this being a critical accounting estimate 
during  the company sold the majority of its omsr portfolio 
see discussions of significant transactions and other non interest income  below 
as a result of the sale  omsrs are no longer considered a critical accounting estimate 
loan securitizations and sale of receivables the company has periodically sold certain indirect automobile loans in securitization transactions in exchange for cash and certain retained residual interests 
the retained interests included rights to service the loans sold  interest collected on the loans that exceeded the amount required to be paid to the investors  the securitization agent and the servicer  and an interest in the sales proceeds that was withheld as collateral for potential credit losses at the time of the initial loan sales 
upon each sale  the company recognized a gain and assets were recorded for retained residual interests 
the company s retained residual interests were subordinated to the interests of investors and the securitization agent  and were also subject to prepayment  credit and interest rate risk 
as a result  the carrying value was periodically re evaluated to determine if they were impaired  and if so  whether the impairment was other than temporary  requiring a charge to earnings 
because of the judgments and assumptions involved in the initial recording and periodic re evaluation  the accounting for the retained residual interests was considered a critical accounting estimate 
during  the outstanding balances of the underlying loans fell to a level where the cost of servicing the loans became burdensome in relation to the benefits of servicing 
as a result  the company exercised its option to repurchase the loans from the securitization trust the clean up call and the carrying value of the retained residual interests was written off 
see discussion of net security losses gains under other non interest income  below 
the repurchased loans were recorded at fair value 
since the company no longer has any retained residual interests  loan securitizations and sale of receivables is no longer considered a critical accounting estimate

key initiatives and other significant items and events key initiatives credit quality the company continues to reinforce a credit quality culture by enhancing the credit risk measurement process 
in  a new risk grading matrix was implemented to provide better granularity of credit risk and to allow management more precise measurement of risk and profitability 
the risk grading initiative established a foundation for continuing to build a more robust credit quality culture throughout the organization 
this will lead to more standardization and centralization of the company s approval  underwriting and early troubled credit identification procedures into and beyond 
cost efficiencies the company is targeting a three percent reduction per year in pre fdic insurance operating expenses in and the efficiency focus will cover all aspects of the business including enhancing the company s commercial straight through loan processing platform 
the efficiencies expected from enhancing the commercial loan processing system are also expected to improve credit underwriting efforts and benefit the credit quality initiative 
core growth the company is focused on measuring business unit performance and closely aligning profitability with incentive compensation in order to drive strong core customer based growth 
this enhancement to focus on profitability  rather than volume measures  has led to improved product pricing that is more reflective of true costs and market risks and will help the company continue to strengthen it s earnings stream

net interest margin was in compared to in net interest margin declined as funding costs increased more rapidly than loan and investment yields 
provision for loan losses increased million  or  to million in from million in  reflecting a increase in net charge offs and a increase in non performing loans 
non interest income declined million 
the decline was primarily attributable to million of net security losses in and a million net insurance claim included in company owned life insurance income  that were partly offset by a million increase in service charges on deposits in over there were no insurance claims in the million gain on the sale of the company s omsr portfolio was offset by a decline in community reinvestment act cra related fund income year over year  and increased derivative mark to market losses 
operating expenses were essentially flat at million in compared to million in increased net occupancy expense  higher foreclosure related costs and increased fraud losses were offset by lower compensation expense  advertising business development costs and professional fees 
income taxes decreased million  mainly due to lower earnings before income taxes 
the effective tax rate was in compared to in earnings review of consolidated statements of income the following highlights a comparative discussion of the major components of net income and their impact for the last three years 
net interest income net interest income is the company s largest source of revenue and represents the difference between income earned on loans and investments interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowed funds interest bearing liabilities 
fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially affect the level of net interest income 
because the interest that is earned on certain loans and investment securities is not subject to federal income tax  and in order to facilitate comparisons among various taxable and tax exempt interest earning assets  the following discussion of net interest income is presented on a fully taxable equivalent  or fte basis 
the fte adjustment was calculated using amcore s statutory federal income tax rate of 

table of contents net interest spread is the difference between the average yields earned on interest earning assets and the average rates incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
since a portion of the company s funding is derived from interest free sources  primarily demand deposits  other liabilities and stockholders equity  the effective interest rate incurred for all funding sources is lower than the interest rate incurred on interest bearing liabilities alone 
overview net interest income  on an fte basis  declined million or in and increased million or in the decline in was primarily the result of a decrease in average investment security balances and a seven basis point decline in net interest spread 
the increase for was primarily driven by an increase in average loan volumes 
years ended december  dollars in thousands interest income book basis fte adjustment interest income fte basis interest expense net interest income fte basis net interest spread and margin see table  page net interest spread declined seven basis points to in from in  and decreased basis points in from the level of 
the net interest margin was in  a decline of three basis points from in the level was a decrease of basis points from in the declines in net interest spread and net interest margin for both periods were driven by higher funding costs  as the rates incurred on interest bearing liabilities increased more rapidly declined slower than the increase decrease in rates earned on interest earning assets 
other factors contributing to the declines in spread were increases in non interest earning assets ie  non accrual loans  a divergence in recent financial markets with higher declines in prime rates compared to libor based rates and the substitution of debt for capital in the repurchase programs 
since the company has a higher proportion of prime based loans and a higher proportion of libor based liabilities  the aforementioned divergence in interest rates resulted in some reduction in net interest spread and net interest margin 
while the repurchase program has improved the efficiency of the company s capital structure  it has also contributed to the compression in net interest spread and net interest margin 
changes due to volume see table  page in  net interest income fte declined due to average volume by million when compared to this decline was comprised of a million decline in interest income that was partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense 
the decline in interest income was attributable to a million decrease in interest earning assets 
the decrease was primarily driven by a million or reduction in average investment securities that was partially offset by a million or increase in average loans 
the growth in average loans came from a combined increase of million in commercial real estate and commercial loans 
average residential real estate loans increased million  while average consumer loan balances declined million 
average interest bearing liabilities declined million 
this was comprised of a million decrease in average bank issued deposits and million decrease in average wholesale funding 
average interest bearing liabilities did not decrease as much as average interest earning assets due to the repurchase program  which substituted debt for capital

changes due to rate see table  page in  net interest income fte declined due to average rates by million when compared with this was comprised of a million increase in interest income that was more than offset by a million increase in interest expense 
both interest earning asset yields and interest bearing liability costs were affected by four basis point increases in the federal funds fed funds rate that occurred during the first two quarters of  which were followed by a basis point and two basis point decreases in late the yield on average earning assets increased basis points to during  compared to in during this same period of time  the rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities increased basis points  to from

interest rate risk like most financial institutions  amcore has an exposure to changes in both short term and long term interest rates 
among those factors that could affect net interest margin and net interest spread include greater and more frequent changes in interest rates  including the impact of basis risk between various interest rate indices such as prime and libor  changes in the shape of the yield curve  mismatch in the duration of interest earning assets and the interest bearing liabilities that fund them  the effect of prepayments or renegotiated rates  increased price competition on both deposits and loans  promotional pricing on deposits  changes in the mix of earning assets and the mix of liabilities  including greater or less use of wholesale sources  changes in the level of non accrual loans  and in an environment such as is currently being experienced where there are rapid and substantial declines in interest rates  the limited ability to reduce certain low cost deposit products rates such as now accounts to the same extent that interest earning assets reprice 
provision for loan losses the provision see critical accounting estimates discussion was million  an increase of million or from million in the increase was primarily due to a increase in net charge offs and a increase in non performing loans in compared to that were driven by a general weakening of real estate conditions in the company s markets 
these market conditions are expected to persist into net charge offs were million or basis points of average loans in  compared to million or basis points of average loans in non performing loans were million at december  compared to million at december  non performing loans is the sum of non accrual loans and loans that are ninety days past due but are still accruing interest

service charges on deposits service charges on deposits  the company s largest source of non interest income  totaled million in  a million or increase over million in this follows a increase of million or from million in service charges on consumer deposit accounts were the primary driver of the increases for both periods and were affected by enhancements to the company s fee structure and waiver policies on both retail and commercial deposits 
while this pace of growth is not expected to continue  the current level of revenue is expected to be sustainable over time with some additional improvement in the near term as a result of the declining interest rate levels that will reduce the deposit offset against activity fees for commercial accounts 
mortgage banking income mortgage banking income includes fees generated from the underwriting  originating and servicing of mortgage loans along with gains and fees realized from the sale of these loans  net of origination costs  omsr amortization and impairment 
for  mortgage banking income was million  a decline of million from million in total closings were million in compared to million in new purchase mortgage closings were million or of total closings in  compared to million or of total closings in the decline in mortgage banking income was primarily due to lower servicing fee income and reduced sales volume due to slowdown in the housing markets that affected new purchase closings and higher mortgage interest rates that affected refinancing volumes 
the decline in servicing fee income for is attributable to the sale of the company s omsr portfolio  after which the company no longer generates fee income in connection with the servicing of mortgage loans sold to the secondary market 
the cost of servicing those loans  a component of operating expense  was also eliminated after the transition 
the company recorded a million gain on the sale of the omsr portfolio  net of transaction costs  during the net gain is included in other non interest income

earnings review by business segment amcore s internal reporting and planning process focuses on four primary lines of business segment s commercial banking  retail banking  investment management and trust  and mortgage banking 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presents a condensed income statement and total assets for each segment 
the financial information presented was derived from the company s internal profitability reporting system that is used by management to monitor and manage the financial performance of the company 
this information is based on internal management accounting policies which have been developed to reflect the underlying economics of the segments and  to the extent practicable  to portray each segment as if it operated on a stand alone basis 
thus  each segment  in addition to its direct revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities  includes an allocation of shared support function expenses 
the commercial  retail and mortgage banking segments also include funds transfer adjustments to appropriately reflect the cost of funds on loans made and funding credits on deposits generated 
apart from these adjustments  the accounting policies used are similar to those described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
since there are no comprehensive standards for management accounting that are equivalent to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the information presented is not necessarily comparable with similar information from other financial institutions 
in addition  methodologies used to measure  assign and allocate certain items may change from time to time to reflect  among other things  accounting estimate refinements  changes in risk profiles  changes in customers or product lines  and changes in management structure 
for example  during  the company refined its method for measuring fund transfer adjustments to include non earning assets  liabilities  and equity  in addition to funds transfer adjustments for loans made and deposits generated 
the effect of this change for was to increase net interest income of the commercial banking and retail banking segments by million and million  respectively 
also during  atm related income and expenses previously included in the other category were included in the retail banking segment consistent with internal management reporting 
for the prior year periods  atm activity has been reclassified to reflect this change

the million of total securities available for sale includes gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million 
unrealized gains and unrealized losses is the difference between a security s fair value and carrying value 
the fair value of a security is generally influenced by two factors  market risk and credit risk 
market risk is the exposure of the security to changes in interest rate 
there is an inverse relationship to changes in the fair value of the security with changes in interest rates  meaning that when rates increase the value of the security will decrease 
conversely  when rates decline the value of the security will increase 
credit risk arises from the extension of credit to a counter party  for example a purchase of corporate debt in security form  and the possibility that the counter party may not meet its contractual obligations 
the company s policy is to invest in securities with low credit risk  such as us treasuries  us government agencies such as the government national mortgage association or gnma  gses such as fhlmc  state and political obligations  and highly rated private issue mortgage and asset backed securities 
unlike agency debt  gse debt is not secured by the full faith and credit of the united states 
the combined effect of the company s gross unrealized gains and gross unrealized losses  net of tax  is included as oci in stockholders equity  as none of the securities with gross unrealized losses are considered other than temporarily impaired 
if it is determined that an investment is impaired and the impairment is other than temporary  an impairment loss is reclassified from oci as a charge to earnings and a new carrying basis for the investment is established 
the company reclassified a million other than temporary impairment loss from oci in the third quarter  relating to a decision to sell approximately million of bonds purchased in and in order to reduce longer term interest rate and liquidity risk 
all of these securities were ultimately sold during fourth quarter for comparative purposes  at december   gross unrealized gains of million and gross unrealized losses of million were included in the securities available for sale portfolio

any contracts with floating rates were calculated using the rate in effect at december  asset quality review and credit risk management amcore s credit risk is centered in its loan portfolio  which totaled billion  or of earning assets  including coli on december  the objective in managing loan portfolio risk is to quantify and manage credit risk on a portfolio basis as well as reduce the risk of a loss resulting from a customer s failure to perform according to the terms of a transaction 
to achieve this objective  amcore strives to maintain a loan portfolio that is diverse in terms of loan type  industry concentration and borrower concentration 
the company is also exposed to carrier credit risk with respect to its million investment in coli 
amcore has managed this risk by utilizing separate accounts in which its credit exposure is to a specific investment portfolio rather than the carrier 
the underlying investment portfolios which are managed by parties other than amcore consist of investment grade securities and the investment guidelines typically have a requirement to sell if the securities are downgraded 
separate accounts constitute the majority of amcore s coli portfolio 
in terms of coli accounts where amcore is directly exposed to carrier risk  this risk has been managed by diversifying its holdings among multiple carriers and by periodic internal credit reviews 
all carriers have investment grade ratings from the major rating agencies 

table of contents allowance for loan losses the allowance is a significant estimate that is regularly reviewed by management to determine whether or not the amount is considered adequate to absorb inherent losses that are probable as of the reporting date 
if not  an additional provision is made to increase the allowance 
conversely  this review could result in a decrease in the allowance 
this evaluation includes specific loss estimates on certain individually reviewed impaired loans and statistical loss estimates for loan groups or pools that are based on historical loss experience 
also included are other loss estimates  which reflect the current credit environment and that are not otherwise captured in the historical loss rates 
the determination by management of the appropriate level of the allowance amounted to million at december   compared to million at december   an increase of million or 
specific loss estimates on individually reviewed impaired loans and loss estimates on loan pools based upon historical loss experience declined million and million  respectively  in compared to other loss estimates to reflect the current credit environment increased million 
the increase in the allowance was taken in light of sustained increases in the non performing categories of the loan portfolio  increased delinquencies  higher net charge offs and general weakening of real estate conditions in the company s markets 
at december   the allowance as a percent of total loans and of non accrual loans was and  respectively 
these compare to the same ratios at december  of and 
net charge offs were million in  an increase of million from million in this was and of average loans in and  respectively 
increases included commercial and industrial loan net charge offs of million  commercial real estate net charge offs of million  residential real estate net charge offs of  and consumer installment net charge offs of  nearly one fourth of the net charge offs in were related to one large relationship 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of non accrual loans  loans ninety days past due and still accruing interest  foreclosed real estate and other repossessed assets 
non performing assets totaled million as of december   an increase of million or from million at december  the increase since december  consisted of a million increase in non accrual loans and an increase of million in loans ninety days past due and still accruing interest  both driven by a general weakening of real estate conditions in the company s markets 
these market conditions are expected to persist into foreclosed assets increased by million due to an increase in other real estate owned 
total non performing assets represented and of total assets at december  and december   respectively 
while the company strives to reflect all known risk factors in its evaluation  the ultimate loss could differ materially from the current estimate 
see critical accounting estimates for a discussion of the judgments and assumptions that are most critical in determining the adequacy of the allowance 
in addition to the amount of non accruing and delinquent loans over ninety days past due  management is aware that other possible credit problems of borrowers may exist 
these include loans that are migrating from grades with lower risk of loss probabilities into grades with higher risk of loss probabilities  as performance and potential repayment issues surface 
the company monitors these loans and adjusts its historical loss rates in its allowance evaluation accordingly 
the most severe of these are credits that are classified as substandard assets due to either less than satisfactory performance history  lack of borrower s sound worth or paying capacity  or inadequate collateral 
as of december  and  there were million  and  respectively  in this risk category that were to days delinquent and million and million  respectively  that were to days past due 
in addition  as of december   there were  of loans that were current  but had loss allocations of  there were none as of december

in general  these loans are considered well secured with a range of maturities of two to ten years 
the company does not have significant concentrations of negative amortization loans  high loan to value loans  option adjustable rate mortgage loans or loans that initially have below market rates that significantly increase after the initial period 
liquidity and capital management liquidity management overview liquidity management is the process by which the company  through its asset and liability committee alco and capital markets and treasury function  ensures that adequate liquid funds are available to meet its financial commitments on a timely basis  at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances 
liquidity is derived primarily from bank issued deposit growth and retention  principal and interest payments on loans  principal and interest payments  sale  maturity and prepayment of investment securities  net cash provided from operations  and access to other funding sources 
other funding sources include brokered cds  fed funds purchased lines  federal reserve bank discount window advances  fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  the sale or securitization of loans  subordinated debentures  balances maintained at correspondent banks and access to other capital market instruments 
bank issued deposits  which exclude wholesale deposits  are considered by management to be the primary  most stable and most cost effective source of funding and liquidity 
the bank also has capacity  over time  to place additional brokered cd s as a source of mid to long term funds 

table of contents uses of liquidity include funding credit obligations to borrowers  funding of mortgage originations pending sale  withdrawals by depositors  repayment of debt when due or called  maintaining adequate collateral for public deposits  paying dividends to shareholders  payment of operating expenses  funding capital expenditures and maintaining deposit reserve requirements 
during  wholesale funding  which includes borrowings and brokered deposits  increased million 
wholesale funding represented of total assets as of the end of both  compared to as of the end of the company remains confident of its ability to meet and manage its short and long term liquidity needs 
investment securities portfolio scheduled maturities of the company s investment securities portfolio and the prepayment of mortgage and asset backed securities represent a significant source of liquidity 
approximately million  or  of the securities portfolio will contractually mature in see table this does not include mortgage and asset backed securities since their payment streams may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to prepay obligations  typically without penalty 
for example  scheduled maturities for  excluding mortgage and asset backed securities  were million  whereas actual proceeds from the portfolio  which included scheduled payments and prepayments of mortgage and asset backed securities  were million 
this compares to proceeds of million and million in and  respectively 
at december   securities available for sale were million or of total assets compared to million or at december  loans funding of loans is the most significant liquidity need  representing of total assets as of december  since december   loans decreased million 
loans held for sale  which represents mortgage origination funding awaiting sale  declined million 
the scheduled repayments and maturities of loans represent a substantial source of liquidity 
table shows  for selected loan categories  that million in maturities are scheduled for bank issued deposits bank issued deposits are the most cost effective and reliable source of liquidity for the company 
during  bank issued deposits declined million 
scheduled maturities of time deposits of  or more  as reflected in table  are million in  of which million are bank issued 
branch expansion the company s branch expansion strategy poses a continuing challenge to short and long term liquidity 
the branch expansion has required  and will continue to require  other sources of liquidity to fund the expected loan growth net of expected deposit growth as well as the required investment in facilities 
parent company in addition to the overall liquidity needs of the company  the parent company requires adequate liquidity to pay its expenses  repay debt when due  pay stockholder dividends and execute the repurchase program 
liquidity is primarily provided to the parent company through the bank in the form of dividends 
the bank is limited by regulation in the amount of dividends that it can pay  without prior regulatory approval 
during and  the company took steps to transfer excess liquidity to the parent company from the bank  with dividend payments of million and  respectively 
for  current bank earnings may be paid as dividends without prior regulatory approval 
an additional million is available  subject to prior regulatory approval  without causing the bank to be less than well capitalized 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other sources of liquidity as of december   other sources of potentially available liquidity included approximately million of unfunded fed funds lines  unused collateral sufficient to support million in federal reserve bank discount window advances  million of unpledged debt investment securities  and million of fhlb advances 
the company also has capacity  over time  to place sufficient amounts of brokered cds as a source of mid to long term liquidity 
the bank s indirect auto portfolio  which at december  was million  is a potential source of liquidity through future loans sales or securitizations 
fed funds lines are uncommitted lines and unpledged investment securities may not result in the same dollar of liquidity due to overcollateralization requirements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as part of its normal operations  amcore is subject to interest rate risk on the assets it invests in primarily loans and securities and the liabilities it funds with primarily customer deposits  brokered deposits and borrowed funds  as well as its ability to manage such risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market values of amcore s financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
like most financial institutions  amcore has an exposure to changes in both short term and long term interest rates 
while amcore manages other risks in its normal course of operations  such as credit and liquidity risk  it considers interest rate risk to be its most significant market risk 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency exchange risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of amcore s business activities and operations 
in addition  since amcore does not hold a trading portfolio  it is not exposed to significant market risk from trading activities 
during  there were no material changes in amcore s primary market risk exposures 
based upon current expectations  no material changes are anticipated in the future in the types of market risks facing amcore 
like most financial institutions  amcore s net income can be significantly influenced by a variety of external factors  including overall economic conditions  policies and actions of regulatory authorities  the amounts of and rates at which assets and liabilities reprice  variances in prepayment of loans and securities other than those that are assumed  early withdrawal of deposits  exercise of call options on borrowings or securities  competition  a general rise or decline in interest rates  changes in the slope of the yield curve  changes in historical relationships between indices such as libor and prime and balance sheet growth or contraction 
amcore s asset and liability committee alco seeks to manage interest rate risk under a variety of rate environments by structuring the company s balance sheet and off balance sheet positions 
the risk is monitored and managed within approved policy limits 
the company utilizes simulation analysis to quantify the impact on income before income taxes under various rate scenarios 
specific cash flows  repricing characteristics  and embedded options of the assets and liabilities held by the company are incorporated into the simulation model 
earnings at risk is calculated by comparing the 
table of contents income before income taxes of a stable interest rate environment to the income before income taxes of a different interest rate environment in order to determine the percentage change 
the following table summarizes the affect on annual income before income taxes based upon an immediate increase or decrease in interest rates of basis points and no change in the slope of the yield curve change in interest rates as of december  as of december  the amounts and assumptions used in the simulation model should not be viewed as indicative of expected actual results 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
the above results do not take into account any management action to mitigate potential risk
