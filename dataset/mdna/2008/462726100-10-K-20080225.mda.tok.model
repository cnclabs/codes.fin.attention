overview irobot provides robots that enable people to complete complex tasks in a better way 
founded in by roboticists who performed research at the massachusetts institute of technology  we have developed proprietary technology incorporating advanced concepts in navigation  mobility  manipulation and artificial intelligence to build industry leading robots 
our roomba floor vacuuming robot and scooba floor washing robot perform time 
table of contents consuming domestic chores  in the home  while our looj gutter cleaning robot and verro pool cleaning robot perform tasks outside the home  and our packbot tactical military robots perform battlefield reconnaissance and bomb disposal 
in addition  we are developing the small unmanned ground vehicle reconnaissance robot for the us army s fcs program 
we sell our robots to consumers through a variety of distribution channels  including chain stores and other national retailers  and our on line store  and to the us military and other government agencies worldwide 
as of december   we had full time employees 
we have developed expertise in all the disciplines necessary to build durable  high performance and cost effective robots through the close integration of software  electronics and hardware 
our core technologies serve as reusable building blocks that we adapt and expand to develop next generation and new products  reducing the time  cost and risk of product development 
our significant expertise in robot design and engineering  combined with our management team s experience in military and consumer markets  positions us to capitalize on the expected growth in the market for robots 
over the past five years  we have sold more than million of our home care robots 
we have also sold more than  of our packbot tactical military robots  most of which have been sold to the us military and deployed on missions in afghanistan and iraq 
although we have successfully launched consumer and military products  our continued success depends upon our ability to respond to a number of future challenges 
we believe the most significant of these challenges include increasing competition in the markets for both our consumer and military products  our ability to obtain us federal government funding for research and development programs  and our ability to successfully develop and introduce products and product enhancements 
initial public offering on november   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at per share  comprised of  primary shares and  shares offered by selling stockholders  which includes the exercise of the over allotment option by the underwriters of the offering 
in connection with the offering  all of the outstanding shares of our preferred stock were converted into an equal number of shares of common stock 
the sale of the  shares of common stock in connection with our initial public offering resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million after deducting underwriters discounts and offering related expenses 
a summary of the terms of the offering can be found in our registration statement no 
on form s  as amended  as filed with the securities and exchange commission 
revenue we currently derive revenue from product sales and research and development programs 
product revenue is derived from the sale of our various home care robots and packbot robots and related accessories 
research and development revenue is derived from the execution of contracts awarded by the us federal government  other governments and a small number of other partners 
in the future  we expect to derive increasing revenue from product maintenance and support services due to a focused effort to market these services to the expanding installed base of our robots 
we currently derive a majority of our product revenue from the sale of our home care robots and our packbot tactical military robots 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   product revenues accounted for and of total revenue  respectively 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   our funded research and development contracts accounted for approximately and of our total revenue  respectively 
we expect to continue to perform funded research and development work with the intent of leveraging the technology developed to advance our new product development efforts 
in the future  however  we expect that revenue from funded research and development contracts could grow modestly on an absolute dollar basis and represent a decreasing percentage of our total revenue due to the anticipated growth in consumer and military product revenue 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december  approximately and  respectively  of our home robot product revenue resulted from sales to customers  primarily us retailers 

table of contents direct to consumer revenue generated through our irobot on line store accounted for of our home robot product revenue for the fiscal year ended december  compared to in the fiscal year ended december  in addition  and of military product revenue  and and of funded research and development contract revenue  resulted from orders and contracts with the us federal government in the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   sales to non us customers accounted for and of total revenue  respectively 
our revenue from product sales is generated through sales to our retail distribution channels  our distributor network and to certain us and foreign governments 
in  when our roomba robot was first commercially introduced and throughout  we recognized revenue from our us consumer product sales on a sell through basis when retail stores sold our roomba robots to end users 
in the first quarter of  we began recognizing revenue from us consumer product sales on a sell in basis when our robots are shipped by us to the retail stores 
as a result of this change in accounting treatment  in the first quarter of we recognized million of product revenue from products shipped prior to this one time increase impacts period to period comparisons relating to revenue from sales of our military robots is recognized upon the later to occur of shipment or customer acceptance 
revenue from consumer product sales is significantly seasonal  with a majority of our consumer product revenue generated in the second half of the year in advance of the holiday season 
the timing of holiday season shipments could materially affect our third or fourth quarter consumer product revenue in any fiscal year 
revenue from our military robot sales and revenue from funded research and development contracts are occasionally influenced by the september fiscal year end of the us federal government  but are not otherwise significantly seasonal 
in addition  our revenue can be affected by the timing of the release of new products and the award of new contracts 
cost of revenue cost of product revenue includes the cost of raw materials and labor that go into the development and manufacture of our products as well as manufacturing overhead costs such as manufacturing engineering  quality assurance  logistics and warranty costs 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   cost of product revenue was and of total product revenue  respectively 
raw material costs  which are our most significant cost items  can fluctuate materially on a periodic basis  although many components have been historically stable 
additionally  unit costs can vary significantly depending on the mix of products sold 
during in particular  the cost of some materials increased significantly  especially nickel for batteries 
the aggregate cost of batteries for our home robots was especially impacted in  as nickel prices more than doubled on a per ton basis 
there can be no assurance that our costs of raw materials will not increase 
labor costs also comprise a significant portion of our cost of revenue 
compared to our packbot tactical military robots  labor costs for our home robots comprise a greater percentage of the associated cost of revenue 
we outsource the manufacture of our home robots to contract manufacturers in china 
while labor costs in china traditionally have been favorable compared to labor costs elsewhere in the world  including the united states  we believe that labor in china is becoming more scarce 
consequently  the labor costs for our home robots could increase in the future 
cost of contract revenue includes the direct labor costs of engineering resources committed to funded research and development contracts  as well as third party consulting  travel and associated direct material costs 
additionally  we include overhead expenses such as indirect engineering labor  occupancy costs associated with the project resources  engineering tools and supplies and program management expenses 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   cost of contract revenue was and of total contract revenue  respectively 
gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue varies according to the mix of product and contract revenue  the mix of products sold  total sales volume  and levels of other product costs such as warranty  scrap  re work and 
table of contents manufacturing overhead 
for the years ended december  and december   gross profit was and of total revenue  respectively 
as a result of our change in accounting from a sell through to sell in basis in the first quarter of  we recognized million of gross profit in the first quarter of  which disproportionately increased our gross profit as a percentage of revenues in that quarter and in research and development expenses research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our engineers  costs for high technology components used in product and prototype development  and costs of test equipment used during product development 
we have significantly expanded our research and development capabilities and expect to continue to expand these capabilities in the future 
an example of this is the engineering design center we opened in india late in a substantial portion of our research and development is performed in the united states  although we maintain an increasing number of engineering personnel in india and hong kong to serve as a liaison between our us based engineering staff and our outsourced manufacturer in china 
we are committed to increasing the level of innovative design and development of new products as we strive to enhance our ability to serve our existing consumer and military markets as well as new markets for robots 
accordingly  we anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   research and development expense was million and million  or and of total revenue  respectively 
in addition to our internal research and development activities discussed above  we incur research and development expenses under funded development arrangements with both governments and other third parties 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   these expenses amounted to million and million  respectively 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these expenses have been classified as cost of revenue rather than research and development expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for sales and marketing personnel  salaries and related costs for executives and administrative personnel  advertising  marketing and other brand building costs  fulfillment costs associated with direct to consumer sales through the irobot on line store  customer service costs  professional services costs  information systems and infrastructure costs  travel and related costs  and occupancy and other overhead costs 
as we focus on increasing our market penetration and continuing to build brand awareness  we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will continue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future  as we intend to continue aggressively building on the irobot brand 
for the fiscal years ended december  and december   selling  general and administrative expense was million and million  or and of total revenue  respectively 

table of contents litigation and related expenses in fiscal  we incurred million of litigation and settlement related costs associated with two related lawsuits filed by us in august the first of these lawsuits was filed in massachusetts superior court  and subsequently transferred to the united states district court for the district of massachusetts  against robotic fx  inc and jameel ahed alleging  among other things  misappropriation of trade secrets and breach of contract 
the second lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the northern district of alabama against robotic fx  inc alleging willful infringement of two patents owned by us 
see item legal proceedings included elsewhere in the annual report on form k for a more detailed discussion of this litigation and related settlement 
fiscal periods historically  our fiscal year ended on december and our fiscal quarters ended on march  june  september and december reference to fiscal  for example  refers to the fiscal year ended december  beginning in fiscal  we began to operate and report using a week fiscal year ending on the saturday closest to december accordingly  each of our fiscal quarters ends on the saturday that falls closest to the last day of the third calendar month of the quarter 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of consumer products under the terms of the customer agreement upon transfer of title to the customer  provided the price is fixed or determinable  collection is determined to be probable and no significant obligations remain 
sales to resellers are subject to agreements allowing for limited rights of return for defective products only  rebates and price protection 
we have typically not taken product returns except for defective products 
accordingly  we reduce revenue for our estimates of liabilities for these rights at the time the related sale is recorded 
we establish a provision for sales returns for products sold by resellers directly or through our distributors based on historical return experience 
we have aggregated and analyzed historical returns from resellers and end users which form the basis of our estimate of future sales returns by resellers or end users 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists  the provision for these estimated returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue at the time that the related revenue is recorded 
if actual returns from retailers differ significantly from our estimates  such differences could have a material impact on our results of operations for the period in which the actual returns become known 
our returns reserve is calculated as a percentage of gross consumer product revenue 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in our actual experience of returns would have a material impact on our quarterly and annual results of operations 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of returns 
the estimates and reserve for rebates and price protection are based on specific programs  expected usage and historical experience 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
through  we recognized revenue on sales to certain distributors and retail customers upon their sale to the end user 
starting in the first quarter of  as a result of our accumulation of sufficient experience to reasonably estimate allowances for product returns  we adopted the standard industry practice of recognizing revenue on all sales upon delivery of product to distributors and retail stores and established a related allowance for future returns based upon historical experience 
if future 
table of contents trends or our ability to estimate were to change significantly from those experienced in the past  incremental reductions or increases to revenue may result based on this new experience 
under cost plus research and development contracts  we recognize revenue based on costs incurred plus a pro rata portion of the total fixed fee 
we recognize revenue on fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method 
costs and estimated gross profits on contracts are recorded as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs utilizing the most recent estimates of costs and funding 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from final contract settlements  may result in revisions to costs and income  and are recorded or recognized  as the case may be  in the period in which the revisions are determined 
since many contracts extend over a long period of time  revisions in cost and funding estimates during the progress of work have the effect of adjusting earnings applicable to past performance in the current period 
when the current contract estimate indicates a loss  provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
revenue earned in excess of billings  if any  is recorded as unbilled revenue 
billings in excess of revenue earned  if any  are recorded as deferred revenue 
accounting for stock based awards effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee services 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grants 
prior to january   we accounted for share based compensation to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  or apb  no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
we also followed the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas no 
r and  accordingly financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented in this annual report on form k have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation 
in a review of our stock based compensation accounting methodology performed in the fiscal quarter ended june   we determined that a cumulative adjustment of million of incremental stock based compensation expense  and a balance sheet reclassification of million from deferred compensation to additional paid in capital  were required due to a correction in the application of sfas no 
r 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r on january   we incorrectly valued  stock options that were granted between the date that we filed our initial form s registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  on july  and the date we became a public company november  
we believe  in accordance with apb no 
 interim financial reporting  paragraph  that this adjustment was not material to our full year results for in addition  we do not believe the adjustment is material to the amounts reported by us in previous periods 
this cumulative adjustment was recorded during the three month period ended june  and is included in the cost of revenue and operating expenses for the fiscal year ended december  under sfas no 
r  entities that become public companies after june  and used the minimum value method of measuring equity share options and similar instruments as a non public company for either recognition or pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas no 
shall apply the provisions of sfas no 
r prospectively to new and or modified awards after the adoption of sfas no 
r 
companies should continue to account for any portion of awards outstanding at the date of initial application of sfas no 
r using the accounting principles originally applied to those awards either the minimum value method under sfas no 
or the provisions of apb no 
and its related interpretive guidance 
accordingly  we did not record any cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle associated with the adoption of sfas no 
r 
as of december   the deferred stock based compensation balance associated with these grants was million 
we will continue to recognize the associated stock based compensation expense  in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 related to these shares of million  million and million for  and  respectively 

table of contents under the provisions of sfas no 
r  we recognized million of stock based compensation expense during the fiscal year ended december  for stock options granted subsequent to our initial filing of our form s with the sec 
the unamortized fair value as of december  associated with these grants was million with a weighted average remaining recognition period of years 
the fair value of each option grant for the fiscal year ended december  was computed on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions fiscal year ended december  risk free interest rate expected dividend yield expected life years expected volatility the risk free interest rate is derived from the average us treasury constant maturity rate  which approximates the rate in effect at the time of grant  commensurate with the expected life of the instrument 
the dividend yield is zero based upon the fact that we have never paid and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
the expected term calculation is based upon the simplified method provided under sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
under sab no 
 the expected term is developed by averaging the contractual term of the stock option grants or years with the associated vesting term typically to years 
given our initial public offering in november and the resulting short history as a public company  we could not rely solely on company specific historical data for purposes of establishing expected volatility 
consequently  we performed an analysis that included company specific historical data combined with data of several peer companies with similar expected option lives to develop an expected volatility assumption 
based upon the above assumptions  the weighted average fair value of each stock option granted for the fiscal year ended december  was 
during the fiscal year ended december   the company recognized  and  of stock based compensation associated with restricted stock awards and restricted stock units  respectively 
unamortized expense associated with restricted stock awards and restricted stock units at december   was  and  respectively 
we have assumed a forfeiture rate of for all stock options  restricted stock awards and restricted stock based units granted subsequent to the company s initial filing of its form s with the sec with the exception of those issued to executives and directors for which forfeiture rates of and were assumed for fiscal years and  respectively 
in the future  we will record incremental stock based compensation expense if the actual forfeiture rates are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior stock based compensation expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
sfas no 
r requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates to value equity based compensation 
accounting for income taxes deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we have million of federal net operating loss carry forwards as of december  relating to stock option deductions for which the tax effected amount of approximately million would be credited to additional paid in capital upon realization 
the use of these net operating loss carry forwards may be limited by changes in our ownership 
we expect that these net operating loss carry forwards will impact our tax liability over the next several 
table of contents years 
there  however  can be no assurance as to the rate at which these net operating loss carry forwards can be utilized  or as to whether there will be any other tax incentives available after we monitor the realization of our deferred tax assets based on changes in circumstances  for example  recurring periods of income for tax purposes following historical periods of cumulative losses or changes in tax laws or regulations 
our income tax provision and our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets involve significant judgments and estimates 
in fiscal  we completed an analysis of historical and projected future profitability which resulted in the full release of the valuation allowance relating to federal deferred tax assets 
we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against state deferred tax assets due to less certainty of their realizability given the shorter expiration period associated with these state deferred tax assets and the generation of state tax credits in excess of the state tax liability 
at december   we have total deferred tax assets of million and a valuation allowance of million resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million 
warranty we typically provide a one year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship and will either repair the goods  provide replacement products at no charge to the customer or refund amounts to the customer for defective products 
we record estimated warranty costs  based on historical experience by product  at the time we recognize product revenue 
as the complexity of our products increases  we could experience higher warranty claims relative to sales than we have previously experienced  and we may need to increase these estimated warranty reserves 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost of our inventory or its current estimated market value 
we write down inventory for obsolescence or unmarketable inventories based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
because of the seasonality of our consumer product sales and inventory levels  obsolescence of technology and product life cycles  we generally write down inventory to net realizable value based on forecasted product demand 
actual demand and market conditions may be lower than those that we project and this difference could have a material adverse effect on our gross profit if inventory write downs beyond those initially recorded become necessary 
alternatively  if actual demand and market conditions are more favorable than those we estimated at the time of such a write down  our gross profit could be favorably impacted in future periods

the million increase in revenue from our home robots division was driven by a million increase in robot revenue due to a increase in units shipped and a increase in average selling prices  along with a million increase in product life cycle revenue spares and accessories 
total home care robots shipped in fiscal totalled approximately  units compared to approximately  units in fiscal the million increase in revenue from our government and industrial business was driven by a million increase in military robots revenue due to a increase in units shipped and a increase in net average selling prices  and a million increase in product life cycle revenue robot spares  services and training 
total military robots shipped in fiscal was units compared to units in fiscal 
table of contents cost of revenue fiscal year ended december  december  dollar change percent change dollars in thousands total cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue total cost of revenue increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to a increase in the unit sales of our home care robots  and a increase in the unit sales of our military robots in fiscal as compared to fiscal the home robots division cost of revenue increased as a percent of revenue by percentage points in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a increase in average unit costs driven primarily by the mix of higher cost products and increased battery costs due to the increased cost of nickel 
the government and industrial robots division cost of revenue decreased as a percent of revenue by percentage points for fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease was due to the above mentioned increase in average selling prices and higher margins on increased product life cycle revenue  partially offset by a increase in the average unit cost of products sold 
gross profit fiscal year ended december  december  dollar change percent change dollars in thousands total gross profit as a percentage of total revenue gross profit increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to in fiscal from of revenue in fiscal this percentage decrease in gross profit was the result of the home robots division gross profit decreasing percentage points partially offset by the government and industrial gross profit increasing percentage points  and the higher mix of government and industrial revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal the home robots division decrease was driven primarily by higher average unit costs due to the mix of higher cost products and increased battery costs  while the government and industrial increase was driven by the mix of higher margin products and a higher percentage of product revenue as compared to contract revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development fiscal year ended december  december  dollar change percent change dollars in thousands total research and development as a percentage of total revenue research and development expenses increased by million or to million percent of revenue in fiscal  from million of revenue for fiscal the home robots division research and development expenses increased in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to hiring  depreciation and costs associated with the india design center  offset by reductions in the government and industrial division 
this reduction in government and industrial expenses was largely attributable to the fact that expenses included accelerated spending as a result of our decision to invest higher than planned earnings in research and development activities  a strategy that was not repeated in overall internal research and development headcount increased to at december  compared to as of december   an increase of employee 

table of contents in addition to our internal research and development activities discussed above  we incur research and development expenses under funded development arrangements with both governments and industrial third parties 
for fiscal these expenses amounted to million compared to million for the comparable period in the increase in these expenses was primarily due to increased headcount in our contract research and development function to employees at december  from employees at december  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  these expenses have been classified as cost of revenue rather than research and development expense as they are executed under funded research contracts 
selling and marketing fiscal year ended december  december  dollar change percent change dollars in thousands total selling and marketing as a percentage of total revenue selling and marketing expenses increased by million or to million of revenue in fiscal from million of revenue in fiscal the million increase in the home robot division selling and marketing expense was primarily driven by a million increase in costs associated with our increased direct business  including both website sales and infomercial programs which were run earlier in the year  offset by lower television media expenses 
additionally  trade shows and other marketing related activities increased by million  people related costs increased by million and sales commissions increased by million 
government and industrial division selling and marketing expenses were up million for fiscal as compared to fiscal due primarily to million of increased compensation and benefit related expense resulting from the expansion of our sales team  million increased travel costs  million in increased sales commission due to a new commissions program and million increase in stock compensation expense 
in fiscal  we expect to continue to invest in sales and marketing to increase brand awareness

the million increase in revenue from our home robots division was driven primarily by the initial distribution into the retail channel of our scooba floor washing robot  which was released late in  continued demand for our roomba floor vacuuming robot and an increase in net average selling prices 
total home floor care robots shipped in fiscal was approximately  units compared to approximately  units in fiscal included in this million growth was an increase of approximately million in sales through our direct on line store as compared to million of direct revenue in fiscal during fiscal  we reduced our home robots products return reserve accrual rate based on an analysis that indicated that our actual customer return rates had decreased significantly and  accordingly  during the third quarter we revised our returns reserve rate and reduced the returns reserve as of october  as a result of this decrease  during the third quarter of  
table of contents we recognized an additional million of home robot product revenue related to robots shipped both during the third quarter of and during prior periods 
the million increase in revenue from our government and industrial business for fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to a increase in the number of military robots shipped combined with a increase in associated net average selling prices  a increase in recurring contract revenues generated under funded research and development contracts and the impact of million associated with the united kingdom ministry of defence contract modification 
also included in this million growth was an increase of approximately million in product life cycle revenue robot spares  as compared to million of product life cycle revenue in fiscal  which was primarily driven by the increased demand for our military robots

in addition to our internal research and development activities discussed above  we incur research and development expenses under funded development arrangements with both governments and industrial third parties

table of contents as of february   we held million of variable rate bonds or auction rate securities  all of which were purchased in january or february of a substantial majority of the underlying assets of these auction rate securities are student loans which are backed by the federal government under the federal family education loan program 
on february  one auction failed for million of our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed in the future 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a more detailed discussion of these auction rate securities 
we manufacture and distribute our products through contract manufacturers and third party logistics providers 
we believe that this approach gives us the advantages of relatively low capital investment and significant flexibility in scheduling production and managing inventory levels 
by leasing our office facilities  we also minimize the cash needed for expansion 
accordingly  our capital spending is generally limited to leasehold improvements  computers  office furniture and product specific production tooling  internal use software and test equipment 
in fiscal and  we spent million and million  respectively  on capital equipment 
during  our strategy for delivering product to our retail customers changed from a model that emphasized container shipments directly to the retailer from china to a model emphasizing improved logistics capabilities that allow our retail partners to take possession of product on a domestic basis 
accordingly  our home robots product inventory consists of goods shipped to our third party logistic providers for the fulfillment of retail orders and direct to consumer sales 
our inventory of military products is minimal as they are generally built to order 
our contract manufacturers are responsible for purchasing and stocking the components required for the production of our products  and they invoice us when the finished goods are shipped 
our consumer product sales are  and are expected to continue to be  highly seasonal 
this seasonality typically results in a net use of cash in support of operating needs during the first half of the year with the low point generally occurring in the middle of the third quarter  and a favorable cash flow during the second half of the year 
in the past  we have relied on our working capital line of credit to cover the short term cash needs resulting from the seasonality of our consumer business 
discussion of cash flows net cash used by our operating activities in fiscal was million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal and net cash used by operating activities of million in fiscal the cash used by our operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in accounts receivable including unbilled revenue of million and an increase in inventory of million  offset by net income of million  a decrease in other current other assets of million  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million and an increase in deferred revenue of million 
in addition  in fiscal  we had depreciation and amortization of approximately million and amortization of deferred compensation of million  offset by a million benefit from deferred tax assets which are non cash items 
the increase in accounts receivable  inventory and liabilities in fiscal are directly attributable to the growth in revenue from the comparable period in fiscal the cash provided by our operating activities in fiscal was primarily due to net income of million and an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and accrued compensation of million  offset by an increase in accounts receivable and unbilled revenue of million  an increase in inventory of million  an increase in other assets of million  and a decrease in provision for contract settlement and deferred revenue of million

investment activities in represent the purchase of short term investments net of the sale of short term investments of million and the purchase of capital equipment of million 
investment activities in represent the purchase of capital equipment in support of our growth  including computer equipment  internal use software  furniture and fixtures  engineering and test equipment  and production tooling 
the investment in capital equipment of million consisted primarily of purchases of production tooling  internal use demonstration units  internal use software and computer equipment 
net cash provided by our financing activities was approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal net cash provided by our financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises and the tax benefit associated with excess stock based compensation deductions  partially offset by a tax payment associated with exercise of stock options by our chief executive officer 
net cash provided by our financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of proceeds from stock option exercises 
net cash provided by our financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of million of proceeds from our initial public offering and million from the exercise of common stock options 
the majority of our long lived assets for the years ended december   december  and december  are located in the united states 
however  we have invested in production tooling for the manufacture of the roomba  scooba and looj product lines in china 
we currently have a million accumulated deficit as a result of significant losses incurred through  largely attributable to our investment in internally funded research and development 
based on our historical product development efforts  we launched our first commercial products  our roomba floor vacuuming robot and our packbot tactical military robot  in fiscal since fiscal  our revenue has significantly increased  our investment in internally funded research and development has declined as a percentage of revenue  and we achieved annual profitability since fiscal we have not invested significantly in property  plant and equipment  primarily as a result of our outsourced approach to manufacturing that provides significant flexibility in both managing inventory levels and financing our inventory 
our consumer revenue has been highly seasonal 
this seasonality tends to result in the net use of cash during the second and third quarters and significant generation of cash in the fourth and first quarters of the year 
given the recent success of our products and resulting growth in revenue  we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  cash provided by operating activities and funds available through our bank line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future 
working capital facility on june   we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america  na to replace our expired working capital line of credit with bank of america 
the credit facility will be available to fund working capital and other corporate purposes 
the interest on loans under our working capital line of credit will accrue  at our election  at either i bank of america s prime rate minus or ii the eurodollar rate plus

at december   we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility 
equipment financing facility on june   we entered into a million secured equipment facility with banc of america leasing and capital  llc under which we can finance the acquisition of equipment  furniture and leasehold improvements 
we may borrow amounts under the equipment facility until july  and any amounts borrowed during that period will accrue interest at day libor plus 
after july   all amounts then outstanding under the equipment line will be repaid in equal monthly installments commencing in july and will accrue interest  at our election  at either a fixed or variable rate of interest

at december   we were in compliance with all covenants under the equipment facility 
working capital and capital expenditure needs we currently have no material cash commitments  except for normal recurring trade payables  expense accruals and operating leases  all of which we anticipate funding through our existing working capital line of credit  working capital and funds provided by operating activities 
we do anticipate making significant capital commitments in the next four months for expenditures associated with the planned move to our new corporate headquarters on or about may  these expenditures will be jointly funded by the landlord for this site and by us 
other than this project  we do not currently anticipate significant investment in property and equipment  and we believe that our outsourced approach to manufacturing provides us with flexibility in both managing inventory levels and financing our inventory 
we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  cash provided by operating activities  and funds available through our working capital line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs over at least the next twelve months 
in the event that our revenue plan does not meet our expectations  we may eliminate or curtail expenditures to mitigate the impact on our working capital 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our marketing and sales activities  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the acquisition of new capabilities or technologies  and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services 
moreover  to the extent that existing cash  cash equivalents  cash from operations  and cash from short term borrowing are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  businesses  services or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all

recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  however  on february   the fasb issued fsp fas which delays the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this fsp partially defers the effective date of statement to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
effective for fiscal  we will adopt sfas except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in fsp fas the partial adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas sfas permits entities to choose fair value measurement for many financial instruments and certain other items as of specified election dates 
business entities will thereafter report in earnings the unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been chosen 
the fair value option may be applied instrument by instrument  may not be applied to portions of instruments and is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs 
sfas is effective for an entity s first fiscal year beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption of sfas and have not yet determined the impact  if any  that its adoption will have on our results of operations or financial condition

the provisions of sfas r and sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas r and sfas will have on our results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents from time to time  new accounting pronouncements are issued by fasb that are adopted by us as of the specified effective date 
unless otherwise discussed  we believe that the impact of recently issued standards  which are not yet effective  will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we maintain sales and business operations in foreign countries 
as such  we have exposure to adverse changes in exchange rates associated with operating expenses of our foreign operations  but we believe this exposure to be immaterial 
in late  we began to accept orders for home robot products in currencies other than the us dollar and we expect this practice to continue in the future 
we regularly monitor the level of non us dollar accounts receivable balances to determine if any actions  including possibly entering into foreign currency forward contracts  should be taken to minimize the impact of fluctuating exchange rates on our results of operations 
interest rate sensitivity we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million at december  the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
some of the securities in which we invest  however  may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including auction rate securities  commercial paper  money market funds  debt securities and certificates of deposit 
as of december   all of our cash equivalents were held in money market accounts and our short term investments were comprised of auction rate securities 
as of february   we held million of variable rate bonds or auction rate securities  all of which were purchased in january or february of a substantial majority of the underlying assets of these auction rate securities are student loans which are backed by the federal government under the federal family education loan program 
on february  one auction failed for million of our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that auctions on the remaining auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed in the future 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investments in the near term may be limited  and our ability to fully recover the carrying value of our investments may be limited or non existent 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not carry out the transaction 
all of our auction rate securities  including those subject to the prior failures  are currently rated aaa  the highest rating available by a rating agency 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions or their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our investments without significant loss but the timing of such an outcome is uncertain 
we currently believe these securities are not significantly impaired  primarily due to the government backing of the underlying securities 
however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments recorded value 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other potential sources of cash  including our available line of credit  we do not anticipate that the potential lack of liquidity on these investments in the near term will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments  primarily certain borrowings under our working capital line of credit and our equipment financing facility 
the advances under the working capital line of credit bear a variable rate of interest determined as a function of the prime rate or the eurodollar rate at the time of the borrowing 
the advances under the equipment financing facility bear either a variable or fixed rate of interest  at our election  determined as a function of the libor rate at the time of borrowing 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under our working capital line of credit or our equipment financing facility
