item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations abbreviated pursuant to general instructions i a of form k 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides information that we believe is useful in understanding our operating results  cash flows and financial condition for the two years ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing in item of this form k 
overview we manufacture newsprint  coated and specialty papers  market pulp and lumber  operating pulp and paper facilities and sawmills in canada  the united states  and south korea 
our reportable segments  which correspond to our primary product lines are newsprint  coated papers  specialty papers  market pulp and lumber 
our net loss for was million as compared to a net loss of million for our sales in were billion  a decrease of million  or  from in  average transaction prices decreased for all of our major products except for market pulp  and shipments decreased for all of our major products except for specialty papers 
our operating loss in was million  a decrease of million from an operating income of million in factors that lowered our operating results include lower sales levels  asset impairment and other related charges associated with the initial phase of abitibibowater s comprehensive strategic review  merger related expenses incurred in connection with the combination with abitibi  an arbitration award related to a asset sale  the strengthening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar  reduced benefits from our canadian dollar hedging program  higher wood costs particularly recycled fiber  and closure costs 
these factors were only partially offset by lower costs associated with lower volumes  as well as lower labor  energy  maintenance and chemical costs 
during  immediately upon our combination with abitibi  abitibibowater began a comprehensive strategic review of its operations to reduce costs and improve its profitability 
on november   abitibibowater announced the results of the initial phase of the comprehensive review  which included a decision to reduce our newsprint and commercial papers production capacity by approximately million metric tons per year during the first quarter of the reductions include the permanent closure of our dalhousie  new brunswick facility  as well as the indefinite idling of our donnacona  quebec facility 
additionally  abitibibowater decided to permanently close paper machine no 
at our gatineau  quebec facility 
long lived asset impairment charges of million and severance and termination costs of million were recorded as a reduction of our operating results 
abitibibowater is continuing with the second phase of its comprehensive strategic review which is intended to result in an action plan to further reduce its costs  improve its manufacturing platform  and better position itself in a global marketplace 
abitibibowater plans to announce the results of the second phase of its comprehensive strategic review in the second quarter of  which may impact our operations 
on september   bcfpi received a decision from an arbitration related to the sale to weyerhaeuser of our former pulp and paper facility in dryden  ontario 
bcfpi and weyerhaeuser had been arbitrating a claim regarding the cost of certain environmental matters related to the mill 
the arbitrators in the matter awarded weyerhaeuser a judgment of approximately million  including interest  which was paid in and resulted in a pre tax charge of million 
we had previously established a provision of approximately million in connection with these environmental matters at the time of the sale 

table of contents total assets were billion at both december  and december  total debt short term and long term was billion at december   a slight increase of million when compared to december  cash and cash equivalents decreased by million to million at december  as cash generated from investing and financing activities was used to fund the cash shortfall from operating activities 
our current liquidity assessment and outlook is discussed further in the business strategy and outlook section below 
business strategy and outlook on october   we merged with abitibi  and we each became a wholly owned subsidiary of abitibibowater 
the combination will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition and liquidity going forward 
through the combination  abitibibowater became a global leader in newsprint manufacturing  one that it believes to be well positioned to compete more effectively in an increasingly global market 
in addition  through the combination  abitibibowater is creating a stronger and a more efficient manufacturing platform that it believes will be better enabled to address the challenges of continuing newsprint demand declines in north america and the near historic strength of the canadian dollar 
abitibibowater s goal is to create a low cost  financially disciplined organization with a stronger financial profile and increased focus on value added products and growth markets 
our business strategy is to successfully execute on this goal  the result of which we believe will be a more dynamic and competitive organization better able to meet the needs of our customers and deliver significant value to our shareholder  abitibibowater 
abitibibowater intends for us to maintain our core focus on the largest components of our business  newsprint and coated and specialty papers 
additionally  we continue to focus on the faster growing export market by exporting more newsprint from north america into asia  south america and certain european countries  where market conditions are stronger 
abitibibowater expects to generate annualized synergies as a result of the combination of approximately million by the first quarter of  and anticipate that these will increase to million by the end of some of these synergies are expected to arise from and benefit our operations 
we will seek to implement additional measures as we enhance our operating efficiency and productivity through continual systems analyses and operational improvements 
we believe that the synergies resulting from the combination and these additional measures will enhance our ability to further decrease production costs per ton and to increase operating cash flow and margins 
abitibibowater expects these synergies to be achieved from improved efficiencies both at abitibi and bowater although not necessarily proportionately in such areas as production  selling  general and administrative sg a costs  procurement and logistics costs  as described below approximately million from lower manufacturing costs 
since the combination  abitibibowater has focused on reallocating production of newsprint and paper grades across its combined machine base  improving asset performance by operating machines in narrower ranges around their peak production and sharing best practices among mills to enhance production efficiency and lower cost 
approximately million from reducing sg a costs 
through the elimination of duplicative sales  marketing and customer service personnel and centralization of corporate administration  management  finance and human resource functions  abitibibowater hopes to experience lower fixed overhead costs and achieve headcount reductions 
approximately million from reducing procurement costs 
abitibibowater is seeking to lower prices of key raw materials through negotiation of volume discounts  consolidation of raw materials collection and improvement in inventory management 
approximately million from improved logistics 
abitibibowater also intends to realize cost reductions from improved logistics through an optimization of freight rates as well as an enhancement of distribution facilities and timberland mill and mill customer pairings 
for a description of certain risks relating to the achievement of the synergies described above  see risk factors we may experience difficulties in integrating our businesses with those of abitibi and may not realize the anticipated synergies  efficiencies and cost savings from the combination with abitibi in item a of this form k 
as part of abitibibowater s efforts to provide funding to abitibi  abitibibowater sold million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes the convertible debt  which are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us 
further  we have amended our bank credit facilities to permit abitibibowater to incur the convertible debt  permit intercompany restructuring of the ownership of our coosa pines and grenada facilities and to permit additional cash distributions to abitibibowater 
the lenders withdrew a requirement to secure their debt with the catawba facility 
see note  long term and short term debt  for additional information regarding this amendment 

table of contents abitibibowater has established an aggressive goal of reducing its consolidated debt by billion within the next three years 
for  it has targeted approximately million in asset sales  including non core facilities  us timberlands and the recently announced sale of an abitibi newsprint mill for approximately million in cash 
as part of this debt reduction initiative  abitibibowater will continue to review non core assets and seek to divest those that no longer fit within its long term strategic business plan 
we expect this review to impact some of our assets 
because we recognize that cash preservation is critical  we will continue to take a disciplined approach to capital spending and expect that total capital spending will be significantly less than our depreciation expense 
we have announced price increases for several of our products in the fourth quarter of and further price increases in the first quarter of we expect our financial performance in the first quarter of to be better than our performance in the fourth quarter of we believe that the combination of recently announced price improvements  continued integration efforts  implementation of actions resulting from abitibibowater s strategic review  and further progress toward achievement of synergy targets will result in further improvements in our financial performance 
business and financial review change year ended december  vs 
in millions sales operating loss income net loss significant items that improved lowered operating loss income product pricing shipments change in sales manufacturing costs manufacturing costs employee termination costs change in total manufacturing costs and depreciation  amortization and cost of timber harvested selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative merger and severance related costs change in selling and administrative expenses change in distribution costs change in closure costs  impairment and other related charges change in lumber duties refund change in arbitration award change in net gains on disposition of assets year ended compared to sales sales decreased in as compared to by million 
the decrease was due primarily to lower shipments of newsprint  coated papers  market pulp and lumber  as well as lower product pricing for newsprint  coated papers  specialty papers and lumber 
these were partially offset by higher transaction prices for market pulp and higher shipments of specialty papers 

table of contents operating loss income operating income decreased to an operating loss in as compared to due to a number of factors  including changes in sales discussed previously  and costs as listed in the table above and further described below 
our manufacturing costs decreased in as compared to the decrease is mainly attributable to lower volumes million  as well as lower labor million  energy million and maintenance million 
these were partially offset by a stronger canadian dollar million and higher wood costs million 
the increase in our selling and administrative expenses reflects the impact of merger related costs incurred in in connection with the combination  employee termination costs and higher share based compensation costs 
our distribution costs were flat despite a decrease in shipments 
overall distribution costs per ton were higher as a result of our mix of domestic versus export shipments  higher fuel charges by our carriers and the destination of customers 
in  we incurred million for closure costs  impairment and other related charges related mainly to the permanent closure of our dalhousie  new brunswick facility  the indefinite idling of our donnacona  quebec facility and permanent closure of paper machine no 
at our gatineau  quebec facility 
we also recorded a charge of million relating to an arbitration award for a claim regarding the cost of certain environmental matters related to the sale of our pulp and paper facility in dryden  ontario to weyerhaeuser 
in  we realized million in net gains on disposition of timberlands and other fixed assets 
in  we received a refund of million for lumber duties that were previously paid to the us government as a result of the finalization of a softwood lumber agreement between the us and canada the softwood lumber agreement 
we also realized net gains of million on the disposition of timberlands  two small sawmills and other fixed assets 
net loss net loss in was million  an increase in net loss of million compared to the increase in net loss was a result of the decrease in operating income as noted above which was partially offset by additional income tax benefits recorded in our effective tax rate  which resulted in the recording of a tax benefit on a pre tax loss for  was compared to a tax provision on a pre tax loss of in most of our canadian operations have continued to experience operating losses 
consequently  income tax benefits and tax credits of million and million for and  respectively  were offset by tax charges to increase our tax valuation allowance 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was primarily impacted by the tax valuation charges as described above  the reversal of tax reserves upon the expiration of the statute of limitations associated with certain tax matters  and the tax treatment on foreign currency gains and losses  while the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was impacted by those same items plus the goodwill impairment charge  which did not provide any tax benefit 
our effective tax rate varies frequently and substantially from the weighted average effect of both domestic and foreign statutory tax rates primarily as a result of the tax treatment on foreign currency gains and losses 
we have a number of foreign subsidiaries whose unconsolidated foreign currency gains and losses are taxed in canada 
upon consolidation  such income and gains were eliminated  but we are still liable for the canadian taxes 
due to the variability and volatility of foreign exchange rates  we are unable to estimate the impact of future changes in exchange rates on our effective tax rate 
additionally  we will likely not be recording income tax benefits on most of our operating losses generated in canada  which will have the impact of increasing our overall effective income tax rate in future periods 
to the extent that our canadian operations become profitable  the impact of this valuation allowance would lessen or reverse and positively impact our effective tax rate in those periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas requires that all changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently as equity transactions 
it also requires that any gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary to be measured using the fair value of any non controlling equity investment rather than the carrying amount of that retained investment 
this statement requires expanded presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent s owners and the interests of the non 
table of contents controlling owners of a subsidiary 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of this statement on our results of operations and financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r retains the fundamental requirements in sfas  business combinations  that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
sfas r makes a number of changes in the following areas how the acquisition method is applied  such as measuring the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest at their fair values  recognizing assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contingencies  recognizing contingent consideration at the acquisition date  measured at its fair value  and recognizing a gain in the event of a bargain purchase ie negative goodwill 
sfas r will be applied prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of fiscal years beginning after december   and in the case of post acquisition tax adjustments  for all business combinations  regardless of the acquisition date 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the fair value option established by sfas permits all companies to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the decision to elect the fair value option may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis  with a few exceptions  is irrevocable  unless a new election date occurs  and is applied to entire instruments only  not to portions of instruments 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas would allow us  for example  to change the way we account for certain investments from the equity method where we record our proportional interest in the operations of an investee to a method that would base our income on a change in the fair value of the investment 
we have not yet determined whether we will make this election to change the accounting basis of any of our eligible assets or liabilities 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides enhanced guidance for determining the fair value of assets and liabilities 
sfas also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  as it is applied to financial assets and liabilities and for fiscal years beginning after november  as it is applied to non financial assets and liabilities 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction 
under the guidance of sfas  the valuation of liabilities assumes that the credit risk of the liability is the same before and after the transfer 
we are still determining which of the valuations used in our financial statements will be affected by this guidance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk bowater is exposed to risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates  commodity price risk and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk we have manufacturing operations in the united states  canada and south korea and sales offices located throughout the world 
as a result  we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates in countries outside of the united states 
our most significant foreign currency exposure relates to canada 
approximately of our pulp and paper production capacity and a significant portion of our lumber production are in canada  with manufacturing costs primarily denominated in canadian dollars 
also  certain other assets and liabilities are denominated in canadian dollars and are exposed to foreign currency movements 
as a result  our earnings are affected by increases or decreases in the value of the canadian dollar 
increases in the value of the canadian dollar versus the united states dollar will tend to reduce reported earnings  and decreases in the value of the canadian dollar will tend to increase reported earnings 
see the information set forth under item a risks factors currency fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition  and changes in foreign currency exchange rates can affect our competitive position  selling prices and manufacturing costs for further information on foreign exchange risks related to our operating costs 
to reduce our exposure to differences in canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuations  we periodically enter into and designate canadian dollar forward contracts to hedge certain of our forecasted canadian dollar cash outflows 
we estimate the monthly forecasted canadian dollar outflows on a rolling month basis and  depending on the level of the canadian dollar  hedge the first monthly canadian dollar outflows of manufacturing costs up to of such monthly forecasts in each of the first twelve months and up to in the 
table of contents following twelve months of total forecasted canadian dollar outflows 
we also periodically enter into british pound sterling forward contracts for an amount equal to up to of outstanding sales contracts with uk customers  depending on the level of the british pound sterling 
we are not currently entering into new hedging agreements and those we had previously entered into have expired 
at december   we had no british pound sterling or canadian dollar forward contracts outstanding 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on our fixed rate and variable rate long term debt and our short term variable rate bank debt 
our objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and on the market value of our borrowings 
we have a mix of fixed rate and variable rate borrowings 
at december  we had billion of fixed rate long term debt and million of short and long term variable rate debt 
at december   we had billion of fixed rate long term debt and million of short and long term variable rate debt 
the fixed rate long term debt is exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates  but not earnings or cash flows 
our variable rate short and long term debt approximates fair value as it bears interest at rates that approximate market  but changes in interest rates do affect future earnings and cash flows 
based on our outstanding short and long term variable rate debt  a basis point increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense in and by approximately million and million  respectively 
commodity price risk we purchase significant amounts of energy  chemicals  wood fiber and recovered paper to supply our manufacturing facilities 
these raw materials are market priced commodities and  as such  are subject to fluctuations in market prices 
increases in the prices of these commodities will tend to reduce our reported earnings and decreases will tend to increase our reported earnings 
from time to time  we may enter into contracts aimed at securing a stable source of supply for commodities such as timber  wood fiber  energy  chemicals and recovered paper 
these contracts typically require us to pay the market price at the time of purchase 
thus under these contracts we generally remain subject to market fluctuations in commodity prices
