risk factors and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview was a challenging environment for automotive retailers 
in particular  our company was impacted by two major factors 
the first issue we encountered relates to the macroeconomic issues facing our country 
additionally  most of our regional markets were more impacted than the rest of the nation  particularly in nevada  california  oregon and colorado 
in dealing with the difficult economy  we are taking steps to adjust our cost structure to match lower customer demand 
these steps include cost cutting in the areas of personnel  travel and other inherently variable expenses 
the other area that we believe impacted our short term results was the change to a new way of serving our customers 
this is a cultural change that we believe is critical to our long term success as a national provider of automobiles and related services 
we expect these measures to markedly improve our customers experiences and will reduce our operating cost as we take out complexity in all the ways that we do business with our customers 
some of the items we believe dramatically improve the customer experience include adding interactive personal computers to all showrooms to allow customers a more transparent sales transaction of a shorter duration  centralizing inventory appraisal and control  improving the trade in experience for customers  l auto  a customer focused  stand alone used vehicle store concept  has three stores currently open for business  and the assured experience at our lithia locations 
under this program  we offer all of our vehicles at drive it now pricing 
additionally  all of our vehicle sales will have a day  mile return policy  money back guarantee 
our used vehicles have an if it breaks  we fix it guarantee 
there is no deductible and our guarantee is valid for sixty days or  miles 
all service work will be guaranteed at the estimate price  and comes with a warranty for years or  miles  ensuring the customer won t pay for the same repair twice 
however  as we began to make these changes  they resulted in duplication of certain support functions during the transition and a significant investment in personnel and technology 
while we believe that increased customer retention and economies of scale will be realized  we are in a transition period where many of the benefits have not been achieved 
once implemented  we believe savings in back office staff and simplified job functions will allow us to reduce office staff and total personnel costs in the sale and delivery of vehicles 
our acquisition model is focused on acquiring new vehicle stores where the store is the dominant or the only franchise of that brand in the market 
our goal is to improve the operations of all four departments of every store we acquire 
since  our ability to integrate the stores that we acquire continues to improve 
we have also developed a better process for identifying acquisition targets that fit our operating model 
our cash position  substantial lines of credit  plus an experienced and well trained staff are all available to facilitate our continued growth as opportunities develop 
we believe the current challenging economic environment will lead to a reduction in prices paid for dealerships in the coming months 
also  our focus on current corporate initiatives and l auto will demand more attention by our management team and support personnel 
therefore  we anticipate a reduced pace of acquisitions throughout however  we remain committed to evaluating opportunities for future acquisitions 

table of contents our current new vehicle revenue mix is weighted towards domestic brands at approximately 
our strategy is to target a more balanced mix between our domestic  import and luxury brands in the years ahead 
approximately of our acquisition revenues in were from import and luxury brands  contributing to an improvement in our import domestic mix  especially as we continue to dispose of our lowest performing domestic stores 
in keeping with this model  we acquired five stores and one franchise in with total estimated annual revenues of approximately million 
at april   we had three stores held for sale with their results of operations displayed as discontinued operations 
combined annual revenues of stores disposed of during and those held for sale at april  were approximately million 
we expect that manufacturers will continue to offer incentives on new vehicle sales during through a combination of repricing strategies  rebates  lease programs  early lease cancellation programs and low interest rate loans to consumers 
to complement the manufacturers incentive strategy  we employ a volume based strategy for our new vehicle sales 
chrysler  which represents approximately of our new vehicle sales  has moved to a new incentive program providing approximately in incentives per vehicle 
this is a revision from prior years  which provided a tiered sales incentive based on year over year sales improvements 
results of continuing operations certain revenue  gross profit margin and gross profit information by product line was as follows for  and percent of total revenues gross profit margin percent of total gross profit new vehicle used vehicle  retail used vehicle  wholesale finance and insurance service  body and parts fleet and other percent of total revenues gross profit margin percent of total gross profit new vehicle used vehicle  retail used vehicle  wholesale finance and insurance service  body and parts fleet and other percent of total revenues gross profit margin percent of total gross profit new vehicle used vehicle  retail used vehicle  wholesale finance and insurance service  body and parts fleet and other commissions reported net of anticipated cancellations 

table of contents the following table sets forth selected condensed financial data expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated below 
year ended december  revenues new vehicle used vehicle finance and insurance service  body and parts fleet and other total revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization operating income floorplan interest expense other interest expense other income  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations the percentages may not add due to rounding 
the following tables set forth the changes in our operating results from continuing operations in compared to and in compared to year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease in thousands revenues new vehicle used vehicle finance and insurance service  body and parts fleet and other total revenues cost of sales new vehicle used vehicle service  body and parts fleet and other total cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization operating income floorplan interest expense other interest expense other income  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations

table of contents revenues total revenues increased and  respectively  in compared to and in compared to results the increase in compared to was a result of acquisitions  partially offset by a decrease in same store sales  excluding fleet 
faced a difficult comparison with when total same store sales grew by 
the decrease in same store sales in was also impacted by a weak retail sales environment  especially with our domestic brands 
this was related to the ripple effect from the struggling housing market  high gas prices and consumer debt pressures 
same store sales percentage increases decreases were as follows compared to compared to new vehicle retail  excluding fleet used vehicle  retail used vehicle  wholesale total vehicle sales  excluding fleet finance and insurance service  body and parts total sales  excluding fleet same store sales are calculated for stores that were in operation as of december   and only including the months of operations for both comparable periods 
for example  a store acquired in june would be included in same store operating data beginning in july  after its first full complete comparable month of operation 
thus  operating results for same store comparisons would include only the periods of july through december of both comparable years 
the decline in new vehicle same store sales in compared to was primarily due to a challenging sales environment in and declining sales of domestic manufacturers vehicles that represent a large percentage of our new vehicle sales 
prior year comparisons were high due to aggressive manufacturer incentive programs  which were not sustained at those high levels in same store unit sales were down in compared to the decreases in same store unit sales were partially offset by a increase in same store average selling prices 
the decline in same store used retail vehicle sales in compared to was primarily due to the challenging sales environment mentioned above 
same store retail unit sales decreased in compared to the same store unit decrease was partially offset by a increase in same store average selling prices 
the increase in used wholesale vehicle same store sales in compared to resulted from a increase in same store average selling prices  partially offset by a decrease in same store unit sales 
same store finance and insurance sales were negatively affected in compared to by decreases in same store vehicle unit sales  which lowered the overall opportunity for finance and insurance sales 
this was offset by a same store increase in the finance and insurance sales per unit in compared to penetration rates for certain products were as follows finance and insurance service contracts lifetime oil change and filter 
table of contents the increase in same store service  body and parts sales in compared to was primarily due to a increase in the customer paid portion of the business 
the customer paid portion of the business excludes warranty and currently represents approximately of total service  body and parts sales 
in addition  we realized a increase in same store warranty sales 
results during  we focused on new vehicle sales to gain market share and create long term parts and services business  which resulted in a increase in same store new vehicle retail sales in compared to and compared to an approximately decrease in the industry during the same period 
these industry figures include a large number of fleet sales  so industry retail figures were down substantially more 
improvements in same store used vehicle sales were minor as a result of the heightened focus on new vehicle sales in the increases in unit sales also benefited our parts and service business 
the improvements in finance and insurance same store sales resulted primarily from the unit increases in sales of both new and used vehicles during compared to the increase in total sales for compared to was a result of acquisitions  as well as a increase in same store sales  excluding fleet 
we believe that our strong operating systems  integrated store network and regional market focus contributed to our same store sales increase  especially in the new vehicle sales 
future outlook we anticipate a continued weak economic environment throughout we expect same store sales to decline approximately to  with modest increases in service and parts revenue being more than offset by a decline in new and used vehicle sales 
however  in this volatile and weak environment  a significantly steeper decline in sales could occur 
we believe that  over the longer term  our improved  customer oriented selling system will result in increases in same store sales above industry average 
gross profit gross profit increased million in compared to and increased million in compared to due to increased total revenues as margins in almost every category dropped in both periods 
gross profit margins achieved were as follows year ended december  basis point change new vehicle bp retail used vehicle wholesale used vehicles finance and insurance service  body and parts overall year ended december  basis point change new vehicle bp retail used vehicle wholesale used vehicles finance and insurance service  body and parts overall a basis point is equal to th of one percent 

table of contents new vehicle and retail used vehicle gross profit gross profit margins for both new vehicle and retail used vehicle sales in decreased primarily as a result of the challenging retail sales environment 
the decrease in new vehicle gross profit margin in compared to was due to our focus on selling volume and gaining market share in the decrease in retail used vehicle gross profit margin in compared to was due to a comparison to unusually high gross margins achieved in  which resulted primarily from a healthy supply of good quality trade ins during the employee pricing programs 
used wholesale gross profit the decrease in wholesale used vehicle gross profit margin over the past two years was due to wholesale market conditions  a focus on retailing more used vehicles and pricing trade ins nearer to true market value 
our ability to provide customers with a better value for their trade ins  pricing closer to their true market value  has been improved by our use of technology 
this  however  lowers the gross profit margin we are able to achieve on the re sale of these trade ins 
in addition  as we focus on retailing more used vehicles  we are left with the lower quality used vehicles for wholesaling  which also contributed to lower gross profit margins 
we dispose of our wholesale used vehicles by using centralized controls  holding our own local used vehicle auctions and managing the disposal of units at larger third party auctions 
service  body and parts gross profit gross profit margins in the service  body and parts business line decreased in compared to partially due to a shift in mix towards selling more parts and accessories  which carry lower margins than the service side of the business 
however  due to an increase in volume  same store gross profit increased in compared to the increase in service  body and parts gross profit margin in compared to was due to our continued focus on service advisor training  which has led to gains in the sale of higher margin service items and increases in customer pay business  as well as a number of pricing and cost saving initiatives 
future outlook most of the margin shift we have experienced in recent years is a result of an attempt to emphasize a volume based strategy throughout our business 
we believe this trend will continue and we expect gross margins in all business lines in future periods to remain substantially the same as experienced in the current period 
however  an extended or deep recession or a significant further decrease in new vehicle sales in our markets  would likely further erode our margins during such period 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense sg a includes salaries and related personnel expenses  facility lease expense  advertising net of manufacturer cooperative advertising credits  legal  accounting  professional services and general corporate expenses

on an individual basis  a ford and a chevrolet franchise held by us did not pass the impairment test and were reduced in carrying value by million in the fourth quarter of for more information  please refer to critical accounting policies and use of estimates below 
sg a as a percentage of gross profit is an industry standard for measuring performance relative to sg a 
as a result of expenses detailed above  as well as costs related to our investments in personnel for our centralization efforts  l auto and the other initiatives  sg a as a percentage of gross profit increased by basis points in compared to sg a as a percentage of gross profit was as follows year ended december  our year year to date historical average was 
in  due to continued economic weakness and investments in technology and personnel  we expect sg a as a percentage of gross profit to be in the to range 
we anticipate achieving a positive long term impact related to the investment in our initiatives by a reduction in sg a as a percentage of gross profit in future periods to the low s 
of the basis point increase in sg a as a percentage of gross profit in compared to  basis points related to the change in stock based compensation and a charge for a worker s compensation claim 

table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million and million  respectively  in compared to and in compared to due to the addition of property and equipment primarily related to our acquisitions  as well as improvements to existing facilities and equipment costs related to our initiatives 
depreciation buildings is comprised of depreciation expense related to buildings and significant remodels or betterments 
depreciation and amortization other  is comprised of depreciation expense related to furniture  tools and equipment and signage and amortization of certain intangible assets  including customer lists and non compete agreements 
we expect this expense to grow as we continue to upgrade facilities and equipment in future years 
operating income operating margins decreased by basis points to in compared to in due primarily to the decrease in gross profit margins and increased sg a and depreciation and amortization as discussed above 
operating margins decreased by basis points to in compared to in  due to the decrease in overall gross profit margin and the increase in sg a as discussed above 
floorplan interest expense floorplan interest expense decreased million in compared to in  we recorded a million charge to floorplan interest expense related to our interest rate swaps 
in  we designated our interest rate swaps as cash flow hedging instruments and  accordingly  changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
we realized a decrease of million as a result of a decrease in the average outstanding balances of our floorplan facilities 
in addition  we realized an increase of million as a result of changes in the average interest rates on our floorplan facilities and an increase of million related to our interest rate swaps 
floorplan interest expense increased million in compared to an increase of million resulted from increases in the average interest rates on our floorplan facilities  an increase of million resulted from increases in the average outstanding balances of our floorplan facilities and an increase of million related to our interest rate swaps 
other interest expense other interest expense includes interest on our senior subordinated convertible notes  debt incurred related to acquisitions  real estate mortgages and our working capital  acquisition and used vehicle line of credit 
other interest expense increased million in compared to changes in the average outstanding balances resulted in an increase of approximately million 
a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our debt resulted in a million decrease in expense 
interest expense related to the million of senior subordinated convertible notes that were issued in may currently totals approximately  per quarter  which consists of  of contractual interest and  of amortization of debt issuance costs 
other interest expense increased million in compared to changes in the weighted average interest rate on our debt increased other interest expense by approximately million and changes in the average outstanding balances resulted in an increase of approximately million 
other interest expense was reduced by million  million and million  respectively  due to capitalized interest on construction projects in  and 
table of contents income tax expense our effective tax rate was in  in and in our federal income tax rate is and our state income tax rate is currently  which varies with the mix of states where our stores are located 
we also have certain non deductible expenses and other adjustments that increase our effective rate 
in  the effect of non deductible expenses was magnified by a decline in income due to the slower sales environment 
income from continuing operations income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue declined by basis points in compared to as a result of the decreased gross profit margin  increased sg a  depreciation and amortization and other interest expense as a percentage of revenue being offset by decreased floorplan interest expense and income tax expense as a percentage of revenue 
income from continuing operations as a percentage of revenue decreased in compared to as a result of the decreased overall gross profit margin and increased sg a and interest expense as a percentage of revenue 
discontinued operations during  we added three stores and one body shop to those classified as discontinued operations 
in the third quarter of  we disposed of two of those stores and the body shop 
as of december   we had three stores held for sale 
during  we disposed of two of our stores that were held for sale at december  and classified two additional stores as discontinued operations  which were held for sale at december  during  we sold a building we had held for sale at december   sold one store and classified two additional stores as discontinued operations  which were held for sale at december  results of operations of these stores are shown within discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations

table of contents selected consolidated quarterly financial data the following tables set forth our unaudited quarterly financial data

table of contents in the fourth quarter of  effects of the weak retail sales environment  particularly with our domestic brands  accelerated 
this was related to the ripple effect from the struggling housing market  high gas prices  and consumer debt pressure 
additionally  we experienced higher selling  general and administrative expenses related to our ongoing centralization and l auto initiatives  and we recorded an impairment loss on certain indefinite lived intangible assets of approximately million 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations historically  our sales have been lower in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to consumer purchasing patterns during the holiday season  inclement weather in certain of our markets and the reduced number of business days during the holiday season 
as a result  financial performance is expected to be lower during the first and fourth quarters than during the second and third quarters of each fiscal year 
we believe that interest rates  levels of consumer debt  consumer confidence and manufacturer sales incentives  as well as general economic conditions  also contribute to fluctuations in sales and operating results 
acquisitions have also been a contributor to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources on november   general motors gm completed the sale of a majority equity stake in gmac to an investment consortium 
although gmac continues to be the exclusive provider of gm financial products and services and continues to have the relationships with gm  gm has indicated in its public filings that it no longer controls the gmac entity 
as a result  we treat the financing of new vehicles by gmac after the change in ownership control as a financing activity 
repayments of floorplan debt on vehicles financed prior to this change in control continue to be classified as an operating activity which reduced cash flows from operating activities by million in on a non gaap basis  the elimination of the effect of the change in control would have increased cash flows from operations to million  as opposed to million for the year ended december  we believe the reader should consider this factor in reviewing our statement of cash flows and related cash flows from operating activities 
we do not anticipate this condition to occur in future periods as floorplan financing does not typically change classification categories in the statement of cash flows 
our principal needs for liquidity and capital resources are to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures  as well as for working capital and the funding of our cash dividend payments 
we have relied primarily upon internally generated cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit agreements and the proceeds from public equity and private debt offerings to finance operations and expansion 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  available lines of credit and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating expenses  capital requirements  projected acquisitions and current level of cash dividends for at least the next months from december  beyond months from december   we anticipate the need for possible additional financing options to augment our existing cash and working capital line of credit to accommodate our growth strategy and to be prepared to refinance our senior subordinated convertible notes which can be put to us in may at the option of the holders 
under the third amendment to our credit facility  we have committed to develop a plan by may to create sufficient borrowing availability on our credit line by january to be able to pay off the notes in may potential sources of additional liquidity include financings of existing unencumbered real estate  sale leasebacks of selected owned real estate  subordinated debentures  or other asset sales 
we will evaluate all of these options and select one or more of them depending on overall capital needs and the availability and cost of capital  although no assurances can be provided that these capital sources will be available to us in sufficient amounts or with terms acceptable to us 

table of contents interest rates on all of our credit facilities below ranged from to at december  amounts outstanding on the lines at december   together with amounts remaining available under such lines were as follows in thousands outstanding at december  remaining availability at december  new and program vehicle lines working capital  acquisition and used vehicle credit facility there are no formal limits on the new and program vehicle lines with certain lenders 
reduced by  for outstanding letters of credit 
as discussed below  the availability under the line of credit was increased subsequent to december  flooring notes payable our inventories decreased to million at december  from million at december  we have maintained a disciplined inventory approach throughout as a result  our days supply of new vehicles at december  was days below our average historical december balances and days below our december  levels 
our days supply of used vehicles  however  was days above our historical december  balances at december  and days above our december  balances 
this resulted from softness in the used vehicle market and our conversion to our centralized car center model 
we are working to bring this in line with historical levels 
our new vehicle flooring notes payable decreased to million at december  from million at december  new vehicles are financed at approximately 
share repurchase and dividends our board of directors declared dividends of per share on our class a and class b common stock  which were paid in january  april  july  october and january  and totaled approximately million to million each payment period 
management evaluates performance and makes a recommendation on dividend payments on a quarterly basis 
in june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our class a common stock 
through december   we have purchased a total of  shares under this program  of which  were purchased during we may continue to repurchase shares from time to time in the future as conditions warrant 
current tax law tends to equalize the benefits of dividends and share repurchases as a means to return capital or earnings to shareholders 
as a result  we believe it is now advantageous to shareholders to have a dividend in place 
with the dividend  we are able to offer an immediate and tangible return to all of our shareholders 
credit facility we have a working capital  acquisition and used vehicle credit facility the credit facility with us bank national association  daimlerchrysler financial services americas llc chrysler financial  dcfs usa llc mercedes financial and toyota motor credit corporation tmcc 
in the first quarter of  we executed amendments to the credit facility  providing an increase of million in available credit  for a total amount of up to million  and adjustments to certain financial covenants 
also  we received a one year extension on the maturity date  the credit facility now expires on august  loans are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries and are secured by new vehicle inventory  used vehicle and parts inventory  equipment other than fixtures  deposit accounts  accounts receivable  investment property and other intangible personal property 
capital stock and other equity interests of our subsidiary stores and certain other subsidiaries are excluded 
the lenders security interest in new vehicle inventory is subordinated to the interests of floorplan financing lenders  including chrysler financial  mercedes financial and tmcc 
the agreement for this facility provides for events of default that include nonpayment  breach of 
table of contents covenants  a change of control and certain cross defaults with other indebtedness 
in the event of a default  the agreement provides that the lenders may declare the entire principal balance immediately due  foreclose on collateral and increase the applicable interest rate to the revolving loan rate plus percent  among other remedies 
our working capital  acquisition and used vehicle credit facility increased to million at december  from million at december  primarily due to the timing of payments  acquisitions  capital expenditures related to our initiatives and the development of l auto 
vehicle flooring chrysler financial  ford motor credit company  gmac llc  vw credit  inc and bmw financial services na  llc have agreed to floor new vehicles for their respective brands 
chrysler financial and tmcc serve as the primary lenders for all other brands 
the new vehicle lines are secured by new vehicle inventory of the stores financed by that lender 
vehicles financed by lenders not directly associated with the manufacturer are classified as floorplan notes payable non trade and are included as a financing activity in our statements of cash flows 
vehicles financed by lenders directly associated with the manufacturer are classified as floorplan notes payable and are included as an operating activity 
on november   general motors gm completed the sale of a majority equity stake in gmac to an investment consortium 
although gmac continues to be the exclusive provider of gm financial products and services and continues to have the relationships with gm  a majority equity stake in gmac has been sold to an independent third party and gm has indicated in its public filings that it no longer controls the gmac entity 
as a result  we treat new vehicles financed by gmac after the change in ownership control as floorplan notes payable non trade and related changes as a financing activity in our statements of cash flows 
vehicles financed prior to this change in control continue to be classified as floorplan notes payable trade  with related changes reflected as operating activities in our statements of cash flows  since these gmac vehicle financings occurred while gm retained control of gmac as its captive finance subsidiary 
debt covenants we are subject to certain financial and restrictive covenants for all of our debt agreements 
the credit facility agreement includes financial and restrictive covenants typical of such agreements including requirements to maintain a minimum total net worth  minimum current ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio and cash flow leverage ratio requirements 
the covenants restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness  making investments  selling or acquiring assets and granting security interests in our assets 
at december   we were in compliance with all of the financial and restrictive covenants 
in addition  cash dividends are limited to million per fiscal year and repurchases by us of our common stock are limited to million per fiscal year 
we expect to be in compliance with the covenants for all of our debt agreements in the foreseeable future 
in the event that we are unable to meet such requirements  we would enter into a discussion with the lenders to remediate the condition 
if we were unable to remediate or cure the condition  a breach would give rise to certain remedies under the agreement  the most severe of which is the termination of the agreement and acceleration of the amounts owed 
senior subordinated convertible notes due we also have outstanding million of senior subordinated convertible notes due we will also pay contingent interest on the notes during any six month interest period beginning may   in which the trading price of the notes for a specified period of time equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the notes 
subsequent to our january dividend declaration  the notes are convertible into shares of our class a common stock at a price of per share upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and upon the occurrence of certain events as follows if  prior to may   and during any calendar quarter  the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for at least trading days in the consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding calendar quarter  
table of contents if  after may   the closing sale price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price  if  during the five business day period after any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per  principal amount of notes for each day of such period was less than of the product of the closing sale price of our common stock and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of  principal amount of the notes  if the notes have been called for redemption  or upon certain specified corporate events 
a declaration and payment of a dividend in excess of per share per quarter will result in additional adjustments in the conversion rate for the notes if such cumulative adjustment exceeds of the current conversion rate 
accordingly  following the january dividend declaration  the conversion rate per  of notes is the notes are redeemable at our option beginning may  at the redemption price of of the principal amount plus any accrued interest 
the holders of the notes can require us to repurchase all or some of the notes on may  and upon certain events constituting a fundamental change or a termination of trading 
a fundamental change is any transaction or event in which all or substantially all of our common stock is exchanged for  converted into  acquired for  or constitutes solely the right to receive  consideration that is not all  or substantially all  common stock that is listed on  or immediately after the transaction or event  will be listed on  a united states national securities exchange 
a termination of trading will have occurred if our common stock is not listed for trading on a national securities exchange or the nasdaq national market 
contractual payment obligations a summary of our contractual commitments and obligations as of december  was as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligation total and and and beyond floorplan notes lines of credit and long term debt interest on scheduled debt payments capital commitments fixed rate payments interest rate swaps operating leases we had capital commitments of million at december  for the construction of five new facilities  an addition to one existing facility and one remodel 
of the new facilities  four are replacing existing facilities 
we already incurred million for these projects and anticipate incurring million in and million in for these commitments 
we expect to pay for the construction out of existing cash balances and borrowings on our line of credit until completion of the projects  at which time we anticipate securing long term financing and general borrowings from third party lenders for to of the amounts expended 
we anticipate approximately to million in non financeable capital expenditures in non financeable capital expenditures are defined as minor upgrades to existing facilities  minor leasehold improvements  the percentage of major construction typically not financed by commercial mortgage debt  and purchases of furniture and equipment 

table of contents in addition to the above  in the next to years  we have approximately million to million in planned capital expenditures under consideration for various new facilities and remodeling projects 
these projects are still in the planning stage or are awaiting approvals or awards from governmental agencies or manufacturers 
we feel that these projects are an important part of our future growth strategy 
we anticipate the need for additional financing options to augment our working capital line of credit to accommodate this growth strategy 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses at the date of the financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments on matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on assumptions made by management 
while we have made our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates could have been used in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
our most critical accounting estimates include assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  service contract and lifetime oil contract income recognition  workers compensation insurance premium accrual  discretionary employee bonus accrual  and used vehicle inventory valuations 
we also have other key accounting policies  such as our policies for valuation of accounts receivable  expense accruals and other revenue recognition 
however  these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements 
we review our estimates  judgments and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable 
however  actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of a change in assumptions carrying value of goodwill we have determined that we operate as one reporting unit 
we review our goodwill at least annually by applying a fair value based test using the adjusted present value method apv to indicate the fair value of our reporting unit 
the impairment test is a two step process 
the first step identifies potential impairments by comparing the calculated fair value of a reporting unit with its book value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is not impaired and the second step is not necessary 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the second step includes determining the implied fair value through further market research 
the implied fair value of goodwill is then compared with the carrying amount to determine if an impairment loss is recorded 
the review is conducted more frequently than annually if events or circumstances occur that warrant a review 
future cash flows are based on recently prepared forecasts and business plans to estimate the future economic benefits that the reporting unit will generate 
we estimate the appropriate discount rate to convert the future economic benefits to their present value equivalent 
growth rates are calculated for five years based on management s forecasted sales projections 
the growth rates used for periods beyond five years are calculated based on regional us census bureau data for population growth and the us department of labor  bureau of labor statistics for historical consumer price index data 
the discount rate applied to the future cash flows is derived from an apv model which factors in an equity risk premium  small stock risk premium  a beta  and a risk free rate 
estimated market value of real estate is determined based on information available on each piece of real estate including any outside appraisals obtained on the real estate  and an estimate of market value based on various factors including property tax assessments  local and regional rent factors  or other information to determine fair market value 
during and  we concluded that there were no impairments to the carrying value of goodwill at december  and  goodwill totaled million and million  respectively 
a change in projected growth rates to historical company performance giving no weight to management s budgets and business plan would result in a decrease in fair value of approximately of the calculated fair value based on the apv method 
cost savings associated with management s forecast and business plans reduced to half of the expected success rate would result in a decrease in fair value of approximately of the calculated fair value based on the apv method 
an increase in the discount rate of would reduce the fair value by approximately of the calculated fair value based on the apv method 
the effect of the changes in assumptions above  either on an individual basis  or cumulatively  would not have resulted in an impairment to the carrying value of goodwill during the annual impairment test 
the risk of a goodwill impairment loss may increase to the extent that our market capitalization and cash flows decline 
a negative long term performance outlook could cause the carrying value of our reporting unit to exceed its fair value  which may result in an impairment loss 

table of contents to a lesser extent  a sustained decrease in our market capitalization could also influence our valuation assessment 
should any changes to significant assumptions in our forecast be necessary in the future  this could have a negative impact on the fair value of our reporting unit and result in an impairment of the carrying value of goodwill with a material effect on the financial statements 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to test our goodwill for impairment at least annually 
during  we changed our annual impairment test date from december to october  as this date provides additional time prior to our year end of december to complete the impairment testing and report the results of those tests in our annual report with the securities and exchange commission on form k 

table of contents nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of a change in assumptions indefinite lived intangible assets we have determined that our franchise agreements with various manufacturers represent the most significant portion of intangible assets without a definite life 
we review our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually by applying a fair value based test using the apv method to indicate fair value additionally  we stipulate a period of time prior to testing assets that have been recently acquired in order to allow them to be integrated into our operations 
future cash flows are based on recently prepared forecasts and business plans to estimate the future economic benefits that the store will generate 
we estimate the appropriate discount rate to convert the future economic benefits to their present value equivalent 
we have determined that only certain cash flows of the store relate to the sale of new vehicles and are attributable to the franchise value 
according to emerging issues task force eitf  unit of accounting for testing impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets  we have concluded that the appropriate unit of accounting for determining franchise value is on an individual store basis 
growth rates are calculated for five years based on management s forecasted sales projections 
the growth rates used for periods beyond five years are calculated based on regional us census bureau population growth data and the us department of labor  bureau of labor statistics for historical consumer price index data 
the discount rate applied to the future cash flows is derived from an apv model which factors in an equity risk premium  small stock risk premium  a beta and a risk free rate 
during  we recorded a million impairment related to a chevrolet and ford franchise 
there were no impairments to franchises in at december  and  intangible assets were million and million  respectively 
a future decline in store performance  change in projected growth rates  other margin assumptions and changes in interest rates could result in a potential impairment of one or more of our franchises 

table of contents nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of a change in assumptions service contract  lifetime oil change  and other insurance contract income recognition we receive fees from the sale of vehicle service contracts and lifetime oil contracts to customers 
the contracts are sold through an unrelated third party  but we may be charged back for a portion of the fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
we may also participate in future underwriting profit pursuant to retrospective commission arrangements  which are recognized as income upon receipt 
we have established a reserve for estimated future charge backs based on an analysis of historical charge backs in conjunction with estimated lives of the applicable contracts 
if future cancellations are different than expected based on historical experience  we could have additional expense or income related to the cancellations in future periods at december  and  this reserve totaled million and million  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
a increase in cancellations would result in an additional reserve of approximately million 
workers compensation insurance premium accrual insurance premiums are paid for under a five year retrospective cost policy  whereby premium cost depends on experience 
we accrue premiums based on our historical experience rating  although the actual claims can be something greater or less than the historical experience  which could create our estimated liability to either be under or over accrued 
premiums are based on actual claims plus an insurance component 
we have a maximum exposure to claims in a given year  at which point additional claims are paid by the carrier 
as of december  and  the reserve for workers compensation insurance premiums was million and million  respectively  and is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
we expect that the retrospective cost policy  as opposed to a guaranteed cost with a flat premium  will be the most cost efficient over time 
a increase in claims experience would result in additional reserves of million 
table of contents nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of a change in assumptions discretionary employee bonus accrual we make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions regarding the likelihood of our attainment  and the level thereof  of the annual bonus criteria under our discretionary support services bonus program and other incentive compensation plans in order to record bonus expense on a quarterly basis 
we accrue the estimated year end expense on a pro rata basis throughout the year based on bonus attainment expectations 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made quarterly based on available information and take into consideration the historical seasonality of our business and current trends 
in  of the bonus amount was related to our financial performance for the year  none of which was obtained 
thirty percent of the bonus related to our status with manufacturers with of the bonus based upon achievement of a number of project related initiatives 
total bonus amounts achievable under the plans in were approximately million  of which were obtained 
however  under the plans  our management and board of directors reserves negative discretion to elect to withhold payments under the plans 
for  no bonus amounts were paid to the five continuing senior executives resulting in a reversal of million in amounts otherwise payable under the plan 
if actual year end results differ materially from our estimates  or bonus amounts achieved are not paid  the amount of bonus expense recorded in a particular quarter could be significantly over or under estimated 
the bonus accrual at the end of any given year is accurate and reflective of actual results attained and amounts to be paid 

table of contents nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used effect of a change in assumptions used vehicle inventory used vehicle inventories are stated at cost plus the cost of any equipment added  reconditioning and transportation 
using the pooling method  we test the used vehicle inventory values to ensure inventories are reflected at the lower of cost or market 
we select a quarterly sample of dealerships throughout the year to test book values against market valuations utilizing the kelly blue book and nada guides 
used vehicle inventory values are cyclical and could experience impairment when market valuations are significantly below inventory carrying values 
historically  we have not experienced significant write downs on our used vehicle inventory 
if the book value of our used vehicles is more than fair value  we could experience losses on our used vehicles in future periods 
utilizing a different valuation guide than nada or kelly blue book could result in a different result in our analysis 
if kelly blue book or nada data is not accurate  or market valuations depart from the historical relationship the guides have experienced  we could experience losses not indicated during the analysis 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk variable rate debt we use variable rate debt to finance our new and program vehicle inventory and certain real estate holdings 
the interest rates on our variable rate debt are tied to either the one or three month libor or the prime rate 
these debt obligations therefore expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in these rates 
the flooring debt is based on open ended lines of credit tied to each individual store from the various manufacturer finance companies 
if interest rates increase  interest expense increases 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  interest expense decreases 
our variable rate flooring notes payable  variable rate mortgage notes payable and other credit line borrowings subject us to market risk exposure 
at december   we had million outstanding under such agreements at interest rates ranging from to per annum 
a increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately million  net of tax  based on amounts outstanding at december  
table of contents fixed rate debt the fair market value of our long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall because we could refinance for a lower rate 
conversely  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will decrease as interest rates rise 
the interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
based on open market trades  we determined that our million of long term convertible fixed interest rate debt had a fair market value of approximately million at december  in addition  at december   we had million of other long term fixed interest rate debt outstanding with maturity dates of between july and september based on discounted cash flows  we have determined that the fair market value of this long term fixed interest rate debt was approximately million at december  hedging strategies we believe it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of our interest payments 
accordingly  we have entered into interest rate swaps to manage the variability of our interest rate exposure  thus leveling a portion of our interest expense in a rising or falling rate environment 
we have effectively changed the variable rate cash flow exposure on a portion of our flooring debt to fixed rate cash flows by entering into receive variable  pay fixed interest rate swaps 
under the interest rate swaps  we receive variable interest rate payments and make fixed interest rate payments  thereby creating fixed rate flooring debt 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than to manage interest rate exposure 
that is  we do not engage in interest rate speculation using derivative instruments 
as of december   we had outstanding the following interest rate swaps with us bank dealer commercial services effective january  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the th of each month effective february  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month effective november  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month effective november  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the th of each month effective march  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month  effective march  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month  effective june  a ten year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the st and th of each month  and effective january  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  variable rate adjusted on the th of each month 
we earn interest on all of the interest rate swaps at the one month libor rate 
the one month libor rate at december  was per annum 
the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements represents the estimated receipts or payments that would be made to terminate the agreements 
these amounts are recorded as deferred gains or losses in our consolidated balance sheet with the offset recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the amount of deferred gains and losses at december  were million and million  respectively 
the difference between interest earned and the interest obligation results in a monthly 
table of contents settlement which is reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to the statement of operations as a component of flooring interest expense 
the resulting cash settlement reduces the amount of deferred gains and losses 
on a quarterly basis  we test the effectiveness of our hedges both retrospectively and prospectively using regression analysis 
ineffectiveness occurs when the amount of change in fair market value of the swap from designation to current period end outperforms the change in fair market value of the hypothetical derivative from designation to period end 
any ineffectiveness will be reflected in the floorplan interest expense in our statement of operation in the period in which it occurs 
in  we recorded  of ineffectiveness 
if  in the future  the interest rate swap agreements were determined to be ineffective or were terminated before the contractual termination date  or if it became probable that the hedged variable cash flows associated with the variable rate borrowings would stop  we would be required to reclassify into earnings all or a portion of the deferred gains or losses on cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
additional interest expense  net of tax  on un hedged debt as a result of changing interest rates  based on interest rates effective as of january  was approximately million  million and million  respectively  in  and interest expense  net of tax  on un hedged debt increased decreased during  and by approximately million  million and million  respectively  as a result of increasing interest rates during those periods 
as of december   approximately of our total debt outstanding was subject to un hedged variable rates of interest 
risk management policies we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow attributable to both our outstanding and forecasted debt obligations as well as our offsetting hedge positions 
the risk management control systems involve the use of analytical techniques  including cash flow sensitivity analysis  to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows
