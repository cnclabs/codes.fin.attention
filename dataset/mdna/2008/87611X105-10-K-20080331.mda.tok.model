our acquisition strategy requires access to new capital 
tightened capital markets or increased competition for investment opportunities could impair our ability to grow through acquisitions 
we continuously consider and enter into discussions regarding potential acquisitions 
any limitations on our access to capital will impair our ability to execute this strategy 
if the cost of such capital becomes too expensive  our ability to develop or acquire strategic and accretive assets will be limited 
we may not be able to raise the necessary funds on satisfactory terms  if at all 
the primary factors that influence our initial cost of equity include market conditions  fees we pay to underwriters and other offering costs  which include amounts we pay for legal and accounting services 
the primary factors influencing our cost of borrowing include interest rates  credit spreads  covenants  underwriting or loan origination fees and similar charges we pay to lenders 
in addition  we are experiencing increased competition for the types of assets we contemplate purchasing 
increased competition for a limited pool of assets could result in our losing to other bidders more often or acquiring assets at less attractive prices 
either occurrence would limit our ability to fully execute our growth 
table of contents strategy 
our inability to execute our growth strategy could materially adversely affect our ability to maintain or pay higher distributions in the future 
we may incur significant costs and liabilities in the future resulting from a failure to comply with new or existing environmental regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances or hydrocarbons into the environment 
our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
please see item business our systems 
these laws include  for example  the federal clean air act and comparable state laws that impose obligations related to air emissions  the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state laws that impose requirements for the handling  storage  treatment or disposal of solid and hazardous waste from our facilities  the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla also known as superfund  and comparable state laws that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or at locations to which our hazardous substances have been transported for disposal  and the federal water pollution control act the clean water act and comparable state laws that regulate discharges of wastewater from our facilities to state and federal waters 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations or newly adopted laws or regulations may trigger a variety of administrative  civil and criminal enforcement measures  including the assessment of monetary penalties  the imposition of remedial requirements  and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations or imposing additional compliance requirements on such operations 
certain environmental laws  including cercla and analogous state laws  impose strict  joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances or hydrocarbons have been disposed or otherwise released 
moreover  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances  hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment 
there is inherent risk of incurring environmental costs and liabilities in connection with our operations due to our handling of natural gas and other petroleum products  air emissions and water discharges related to our operations  and historical industry operations and waste disposal practices 
for example  an accidental release from one of our facilities could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs  claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury  natural resource and property damages and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations 
moreover  the possibility exists that stricter laws  regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our operational or compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary 
in particular  we may incur expenditures in order to maintain compliance with legal requirements governing emissions of air pollutants from our facilities 
we may not be able to recover all or any of these costs from insurance 
please see item business environmental  health and safety matters 
a change in the jurisdictional characterization of some of our assets by federal  state or local regulatory agencies or a change in policy by those agencies may result in increased regulation of our assets  which may cause our revenues to decline and operating expenses to increase 
section b of the natural gas act of nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by ferc as a natural gas company under the nga 
we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests ferc has used to establish a pipeline s status as a gatherer not subject to regulation as a natural gas company 
however  the distinction between ferc regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of substantial  on going litigation  so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by ferc  the courts  or congress 
while our natural gas gathering operations are generally exempt from ferc regulation under the nga  ferc regulation still affects our gas gathering operations and the markets for products related to these operations 
ferc has recently issued a final rule requiring certain intrastate pipelines  including gathering 
table of contents facilities engaged in natural gas transactions  to submit annual reports to ferc 
in addition  ferc has recently proposed to require certain intrastate pipelines to post daily scheduled and actual flows on their lines 
other ferc regulations may indirectly impact our businesses and the markets for products derived from these businesses 
ferc s policies and practices across the range of its natural gas regulatory activities  including  for example  its policies on open access transportation  gas quality  ratemaking  capacity release and market center promotion  may indirectly affect the intrastate natural gas market 
in recent years  ferc has pursued pro competitive policies in its regulation of interstate natural gas pipelines 
however  we cannot assure you that ferc will continue this approach as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules and policies that may affect rights of access to transportation capacity 
for more information regarding the regulation of targa s operations  please see item business regulation of operations 
should we fail to comply with all applicable ferc administered statutes  rules  regulations and orders  we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines 
under the energy policy act of ep act  ferc has civil penalty authority under the nga to impose penalties for current violations of up to million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation 
while our operations have traditionally not been subject to ferc regulation  ferc has recently adopted and proposed regulations that may subject certain of our facilities to reporting and posting requirements 
additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by ferc from time to time 
failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject targa to civil penalty liability

unexpected volume changes due to production variability or to gathering  plant  or pipeline system disruptions may increase our exposure to commodity price movements 
targa sells our processed natural gas to third parties and other targa affiliates at our plant tailgates or at pipeline pooling points 
targa also manages the saou and lou systems natural gas sales to third parties under contracts that remain in the name of the saou and lou systems 
sales made to natural gas marketers and end users may be interrupted by disruptions to volumes anywhere along the system 
targa will attempt to balance sales with volumes supplied from our processing operations  but unexpected volume variations due to production variability or to gathering  plant  or pipeline system disruptions may expose us to volume imbalances which  in conjunction with movements in commodity prices  could materially impact our income from operations and cash flow 
we may incur significant costs and liabilities resulting from pipeline integrity programs and related repairs 
pursuant to the pipeline safety improvement act of  as reauthorized and amended by the pipeline inspections  protection  enforcement and safety act of  the dot  through the pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management programs for transmission pipelines located where a leak or rupture could do the most harm in high consequence areas  including high population areas  areas that are sources of drinking water  ecological resource areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage from a pipeline release and commercially navigable waterways  unless the operator effectively demonstrates by risk assessment that the pipeline could not affect the area 
the regulations require operators of covered pipelines to perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity  identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a high consequence area  improve data collection  integration and analysis  
table of contents repair and remediate the pipeline as necessary  and implement preventive and mitigating actions 
we currently estimate that we will incur an aggregate cost of approximately million between and to implement pipeline integrity management program testing along certain segments of our natural gas and ngl pipelines 
this estimate does not include the costs  if any  of any repair  remediation  preventative or mitigating actions that may be determined to be necessary as a result of the testing program  which costs could be substantial 
at this time  we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with this regulation  as the cost will vary significantly depending on the number and extent of any repairs found to be necessary as a result of the pipeline integrity testing 
following this initial round of testing and repairs  we will continue our pipeline integrity testing programs to assess and maintain the integrity or our pipelines 
the results of these tests could cause us to incur significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operations of our pipelines 
the phmsa also is required by the pipeline inspections  protection  enforcement  and safety act of to issue new regulations that set forth safety standards and reporting requirements applicable to low stress pipelines and gathering lines transporting hazardous liquids  including ngls and condensate 
a final rule addressing safety standards for hazardous liquid low stress pipelines and gathering lines is anticipated to be issued by phmsa in these safety standards may include applicable integrity management program requirements 
our construction of new assets may not result in revenue increases and is subject to regulatory  environmental  political  legal and economic risks  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
one of the ways we intend to grow our business is through the construction of new midstream assets 
the construction of additions or modifications to our existing systems  and the construction of new midstream assets  involve numerous regulatory  environmental  political and legal uncertainties beyond our control and may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital 
if we undertake these projects  they may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost  or at all 
moreover  our revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project 
for instance  if we expand a new pipeline  the construction may occur over an extended period of time  and we will not receive any material increases in revenues until the project is completed 
moreover  we may construct facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production in a region in which such growth does not materialize 
since we are not engaged in the exploration for and development of natural gas and oil reserves  we do not possess reserve expertise and we often do not have access to third party estimates of potential reserves in an area prior to constructing facilities in such area 
to the extent we rely on estimates of future production in our decision to construct additions to our systems  such estimates may prove to be inaccurate because there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of future production 
as a result  new facilities may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the construction of additions to our existing gathering and transportation assets may require us to obtain new rights of way prior to constructing new pipelines 
we may be unable to obtain such rights of way to connect new natural gas supplies to our existing gathering lines or capitalize on other attractive expansion opportunities 
additionally  it may become more expensive for us to obtain new rights of way or to renew existing rights of way 
if the cost of renewing or obtaining new rights of way increases  our cash flows could be adversely affected 
if we do not make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms  or efficiently and effectively integrate the acquired assets with our asset base  our future growth will be limited 
our ability to grow depends  in part  on our ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in cash generated from operations per unit 
if we are unable to make these accretive acquisitions either because we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them  
table of contents unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms  or outbid by competitors  then our future growth and ability to increase distributions will be limited 
any acquisition involves potential risks  including  among other things inaccurate assumptions about volumes  revenues and costs  including synergies  an inability to integrate successfully the businesses we acquire  the assumption of unknown liabilities  limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller  inaccurate assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt  the diversion of management s and employees attention from other business concerns  unforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas  and customer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses 
if these risks materialize  the acquired assets may inhibit our growth or fail to deliver expected benefits 
our acquisition strategy is based  in part  on our expectation of ongoing divestitures of energy assets by industry participants 
a material decrease in such divestitures would limit our opportunities for future acquisitions and could adversely affect our operations and cash flows available for distribution to our unitholders 
we do not have any officers or employees and rely solely on officers of our general partner and employees of targa 
none of the officers of our general partner are employees of our general partner 
we have entered into an omnibus agreement with targa  pursuant to which targa operates our assets and performs other administrative services for us such as accounting  legal  regulatory  corporate development  finance  land and engineering 
affiliates of targa conduct businesses and activities of their own in which we have no economic interest  including businesses and activities relating to targa 
as a result  there could be material competition for the time and effort of the officers and employees who provide services to our general partner and targa 
if the officers of our general partner and the employees of targa do not devote sufficient attention to the management and operation of our business  our financial results may suffer and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders may be reduced 
if our general partner fails to maintain an effective system of internal controls  then we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud 
as a result  current and potential unitholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which would harm our business and the trading price of our common units 
targa resources gp llc  our general partner  has sole responsibility for conducting our business and for managing our operations 
effective internal controls are necessary for our general partner  on our behalf  to provide reliable financial reports  prevent fraud and operate us successfully as a public company 
if our general partner s efforts to develop and maintain its internal controls are not successful  it is unable to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or it is unable to assist us in complying with our obligations under section of the sarbanes oxley act of  our operating results could be harmed or we may fail to meet our reporting obligations 
ineffective internal controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common units 

table of contents the amount of cash we have available for distribution to holders of our common units and subordinated units depends primarily on our cash flow and not solely on profitability 
consequently  even if we are profitable  we may not be able to make cash distributions to holders of our common units and subordinated units 
you should be aware that the amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow and not solely on profitability  which will be affected by non cash items 
as a result  we may make cash distributions during periods when we record losses for financial accounting purposes and may not make cash distributions during periods when we record net earnings for financial accounting purposes 
terrorist attacks  and the threat of terrorist attacks  have resulted in increased costs to our business 
continued hostilities in the middle east or other sustained military campaigns may adversely impact our results of operations 
the long term impact of terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred on september   and the threat of future terrorist attacks on our industry in general  and on us in particular  is not known at this time 
increased security measures taken by us as a precaution against possible terrorist attacks have resulted in increased costs to our business 
uncertainty surrounding continued hostilities in the middle east or other sustained military campaigns may affect our operations in unpredictable ways  including disruptions of crude oil supplies and markets for our products  and the possibility that infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of  or indirect casualties of  an act of terror 
changes in the insurance markets attributable to terrorist attacks may make certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain 
moreover  the insurance that may be available to us may be significantly more expensive than our existing insurance coverage 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital 
risks inherent in an investment in us cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate with our performance and the establishment of financial reserves 
because distributions on the common units are dependent on the amount of cash we generate  distributions may fluctuate based on our performance 
the actual amount of cash that is available to be distributed each quarter will depend on numerous factors  some of which are beyond our control and the control of the general partner 
cash distributions are dependent primarily on cash flow  including cash flow from financial reserves and working capital borrowings  and not solely on profitability  which is affected by non cash items 
therefore  cash distributions might be made during periods when we record losses and might not be made during periods when we record profits in order to make cash distributions at our current distribution rate of per common unit and subordinated unit per complete quarter  or per unit per year  we will require available cash of approximately million per quarter  or million per year  based on common units and subordinated units outstanding at december  we may not have sufficient available cash from operating surplus each quarter to enable us to make cash distributions at our current distribution rate under our cash distribution policy 
the amount of cash we can distribute on our units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations  which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on  among other things the fees we charge and the margins we realize for our services  the prices of  levels of production of  and demand for  natural gas and ngls  the volume of natural gas we gather  treat  compress  process  transport and sell  and the volume of ngls we process or fractionate and sell  
table of contents the relationship between natural gas and ngl prices  cash settlements of hedging positions  the level of competition from other midstream energy companies  the level of our operating and maintenance and general and administrative costs  and prevailing economic conditions 
in addition  the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors  some of which are beyond our control  including the level of capital expenditures we make  our ability to make borrowings under our credit facility to pay distributions  the cost of acquisitions  our debt service requirements and other liabilities  fluctuations in our working capital needs  general and administrative expenses  including expenses we incur as a result of being a public company  restrictions on distributions contained in our debt agreements  and the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner for the proper conduct of our business 
targa controls our general partner  which has sole responsibility for conducting our business and managing our operations 
targa has conflicts of interest with us and may favor its own interests to your detriment 
targa owns and controls our general partner 
some of our general partner s directors  and some of its executive officers  are directors or officers of targa 
therefore  conflicts of interest may arise between targa  including our general partner  on the one hand  and us and our unitholders  on the other hand 
in resolving these conflicts of interest  our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our unitholders 
these conflicts include  among others  the following situations neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires targa to pursue a business strategy that favors us 
targa s directors and officers have a fiduciary duty to make decisions in the best interests of the owners of targa  which may be contrary to our interests  our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us  such as targa  or its owners  including warburg pincus  in resolving conflicts of interest  and targa is not limited in its ability to compete with us and is under no obligation to offer assets to us 
the credit and business risk profile of our general partner and its owners could adversely affect our credit ratings and profile 
the credit and business risk profiles of the general partner and its owners may be factors in credit evaluations of a master limited partnership 
this is because the general partner can exercise significant influence over the business activities of the partnership  including its cash distribution and acquisition strategy and business risk profile 
another factor that may be considered is the financial condition of the general partner and its owners  including the degree of their financial leverage and their dependence on cash flow from the partnership to service their indebtedness 
targa  the owner of our general partner  has significant indebtedness outstanding and is partially dependent on the cash distributions from their indirect general partner and limited partner equity interests in us to service such indebtedness 
any distributions by us to such entities will be made only after satisfying our then current obligations to our creditors 
our credit ratings and business risk profile could be adversely 
table of contents affected if the ratings and risk profiles of the entities that control our general partner were viewed as substantially lower or more risky than ours 
our partnership agreement limits our general partner s fiduciary duties to holders of our units and restricts the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty 
the directors and officers of our general partner have a fiduciary duty to manage our general partner in a manner beneficial to its owner  targa 
our partnership agreement contains provisions that reduce the standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty laws 
for example  our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity  as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner 
this entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires  and it has no duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of  or factors affecting  us  our affiliates or any limited partner  provides that our general partner does not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as it acted in good faith  meaning it believed the decision was in the best interests of our partnership  generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner acting in good faith and not involving a vote of unitholders must be on terms no less favorable to us than those generally being provided to or available from unrelated third parties or must be fair and reasonable to us  as determined by our general partner in good faith and that  in determining whether a transaction or resolution is fair and reasonable  our general partner may consider the totality of the relationships between the parties involved  including other transactions that may be particularly advantageous or beneficial to us  provides that our general partner and its officers and directors are not liable for monetary damages to us  our limited partners or assignees for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and non appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the general partner or those other persons acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct or  in the case of a criminal matter  acted with knowledge that the conduct was criminal  and provides that in resolving conflicts of interest  it is presumed that in making its decision the general partner acted in good faith  and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or us  the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption 
targa is not limited in its ability to compete with us  which could limit our ability to acquire additional assets or businesses 
neither our partnership agreement nor the omnibus agreement between us and targa prohibits targa from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us 
in addition  targa may acquire  construct or dispose of additional midstream or other assets in the future  without any obligation to offer us the opportunity to purchase or construct any of those assets 
targa is a large  established participant in the midstream energy business  and has significantly greater resources and experience than we have  which factors may make it more difficult for us to compete with targa with respect to commercial activities as well as for acquisition candidates 
as a result  competition from targa could adversely impact our results of operations and cash available for distribution 

table of contents cost reimbursements due our general partner and its affiliates for services provided  which will be determined by our general partner  will be substantial and will reduce our cash available for distribution to you 
pursuant to the omnibus agreement we entered into with targa and targa resources gp llc  our general partner  targa receives reimbursement for the payment of operating expenses related to our operations and for the provision of various general and administrative services for our benefit 
payments for these services are substantial and reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to unitholders 
please see item certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence 
in addition  under delaware partnership law  our general partner has unlimited liability for our obligations  such as our debts and environmental liabilities  except for our contractual obligations that are expressly made without recourse to our general partner 
to the extent our general partner incurs obligations on our behalf  we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our general partner 
if we are unable or unwilling to reimburse or indemnify our general partner  our general partner may take actions to cause us to make payments of these obligations and liabilities 
any such payments could reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders 
holders of our common units have limited voting rights and are not entitled to elect our general partner or its directors 
unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation  unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and  therefore  limited ability to influence management s decisions regarding our business 
unitholders will not elect our general partner or our general partner s board of directors  and have no right to elect our general partner or our general partner s board of directors on an annual or other continuing basis 
the board of directors of our general partner is chosen by targa 
furthermore  if the unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner  they have little ability to remove our general partner 
as a result of these limitations  the price at which the common units trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price 
removal of our general partner without its consent will dilute and adversely affect our common unitholders 
if our general partner is removed without cause during the subordination period and units held by our general partner and its affiliates are not voted in favor of that removal  all remaining subordinated units will automatically convert into common units and any existing arrearages on our common units will be extinguished 
a removal of our general partner under these circumstances would adversely affect our common units by prematurely eliminating their distribution and liquidation preference over our subordinated units  which would otherwise have continued until we had met certain distribution and performance tests 
cause is narrowly defined to mean that a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final  non appealable judgment finding the general partner liable for actual fraud or willful or wanton misconduct in its capacity as our general partner 
cause does not include most cases of charges of poor management of the business  so the removal of the general partner because of the unitholder s dissatisfaction with our general partner s performance in managing our partnership will most likely result in the termination of the subordination period and conversion of all subordinated units to common units 
we may issue additional units without your approval  which would dilute your existing ownership interests 
our partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests that we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders 
the issuance by us of additional common units or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects our unitholders proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease  the amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease  
table of contents because a lower percentage of total outstanding units will be subordinated units  the risk that a shortfall in the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution will be borne by our common unitholders will increase  the ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase  the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished  and the market price of the common units may decline 
affiliates of our general partner may sell common units in the public markets  which sales could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the common units 
management of our general partner and targa beneficially hold  common units and  subordinated units 
all of the subordinated units will convert into common units at the end of the subordination period and may convert earlier 
the sale of these units in the public markets could have an adverse impact on the price of the common units or on any trading market that may develop 
our general partner may elect to cause us to issue class b units to it in connection with a resetting of the target distribution levels related to our general partner s incentive distribution rights without the approval of the conflicts committee of our general partner or holders of our common units 
this ability may result in lower distributions to holders of our common units in certain situations 
our general partner has the right  at a time when there are no subordinated units outstanding and it has received incentive distributions at the highest level to which it is entitled for each of the prior four consecutive fiscal quarters  to reset the initial cash target distribution levels at higher levels based on the distribution at the time of the exercise of the reset election 
following a reset election by our general partner  the minimum quarterly distribution amount will be reset to an amount equal to the average cash distribution amount per common unit for the two fiscal quarters immediately preceding the reset election such amount is referred to as the reset minimum quarterly distribution and the target distribution levels will be reset to correspondingly higher levels based on percentage increases above the reset minimum quarterly distribution amount 
in connection with resetting these target distribution levels  our general partner will be entitled to receive class b units 
the class b units will be entitled to the same cash distributions per unit as our common units and will be convertible into an equal number of common units 
the number of class b units to be issued will be equal to that number of common units whose aggregate quarterly cash distributions equaled the average of the distributions to our general partner on the incentive distribution rights in the prior two quarters 
we anticipate that our general partner would exercise this reset right in order to facilitate acquisitions or internal growth projects that would not be sufficiently accretive to cash distributions per common unit without such conversion  however  it is possible that our general partner could exercise this reset election at a time when it is experiencing  or may be expected to experience  declines in the cash distributions it receives related to its incentive distribution rights and may therefore desire to be issued our class b units  which are entitled to receive cash distributions from us on the same priority as our common units  rather than retain the right to receive incentive distributions based on the initial target distribution levels 
as a result  a reset election may cause our common unitholders to experience dilution in the amount of cash distributions that they would have otherwise received had we not issued new class b units to our general partner in connection with resetting the target distribution levels related to our general partner s incentive distribution rights 
increases in interest rates could adversely impact our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity to make acquisitions  for expansion capital expenditures or for other purposes 
as with other yield oriented securities  our unit price is impacted by the level of our cash distributions and implied distribution yield 
the distribution yield is often used by investors to compare and rank related yield oriented securities for investment decision making purposes 
therefore  changes in interest rates  either positive or negative  may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units  and a rising 
table of contents interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity to make acquisitions  for expansion capital expenditures or for other purposes 
our partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning or more of our common units 
unitholders voting rights are further restricted by the partnership agreement provision providing that any units held by a person that owns or more of any class of units then outstanding  other than our general partner  its affiliates  their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner  cannot vote on any matter 
our partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations  as well as other provisions limiting the unitholders ability to influence the manner or direction of management 
control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent 
our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of the unitholders 
furthermore  our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of the owners of our general partner from transferring all or a portion of their respective ownership interest in our general partner to a third party 
the new owners of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and officers of our general partner with its own choices and thereby influence the decisions taken by the board of directors and officers 
our general partner has a limited call right that may require you to sell your units at an undesirable time or price 
if at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than of the common units  our general partner will have the right  but not the obligation  which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us  to acquire all  but not less than all  of the common units held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then current market price 
as a result  you may be required to sell your common units at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on your investment 
you may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of your units 
at the end of the subordination period  assuming no additional issuances of common units  our general partner and its affiliates will own approximately of our aggregate outstanding common units 
your liability may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business 
a general partner of a partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership  except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner 
our partnership is organized under delaware law and we conduct business in louisiana and texas 
the limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some of the other states in which we do business 
you could be liable for any and all of our obligations as if you were a general partner if a court or government agency determined that we were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular state s partnership statute  or your right to act with other unitholders to remove or replace the general partner  to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other actions under our partnership agreement constitute control of our business 
unitholders may have liability to repay distributions that were wrongfully distributed to them 
under certain circumstances  unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them 
under section of the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act  we may not make a distribution to you if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets 
delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution  limited 
table of contents partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount 
substituted limited partners are liable for the obligations of the assignor to make contributions to the partnership that are known to the substituted limited partner at the time it became a limited partner and for unknown obligations if the liabilities could be determined from the partnership agreement 
liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interest and liabilities that are non recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted 
tax risks to common unitholders our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity level taxation by individual states 
if the internal revenue service  or irs  were to treat us as a corporation or if we were to become subject to a material amount of entity level taxation for state tax purposes  then our cash available for distribution to you would be substantially reduced 
the anticipated after tax economic benefit of an investment in the common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we have not requested  and do not plan to request  a ruling from the irs on this or any other tax matter affecting us 
despite the fact that we are a limited partnership under delaware law  it is possible in certain circumstances for a partnership such as ours to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes 
although we do not believe based upon our current operations that we are so treated  a change in our business or a change in current law could cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to taxation as an entity 
if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate  which is currently a maximum of and would likely pay state income tax at varying rates 
distributions to you would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions  and no income  gains  losses or deductions would flow through to you 
because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation  our cash available for distribution to you would be substantially reduced 
therefore  treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to the unitholders  likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units 
current law may change so as to cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation 
at the federal level  legislation has been proposed that would eliminate partnership tax treatment for certain publicly traded partnerships 
although such legislation would not apply to us as currently proposed  it could be amended prior to enactment in a manner that does apply to us 
we are unable to predict whether any of these changes  or other proposals will ultimately be enacted 
moreover  any modification to the federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively 
any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units 
at the state level  because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise and other forms of taxation 
for example  we are required to pay texas franchise tax at a maximum effective rate of of our gross income apportioned to texas in the prior year 
imposition of any such tax on us by any other state will reduce the cash available for distribution to you 
our partnership agreement provides that if a law is enacted or existing law is modified or interpreted in a manner that subjects us to taxation as a corporation or otherwise subjects us to entity level taxation for federal  state or local income tax purposes  the minimum quarterly distribution amount and the target distribution amounts may be adjusted to reflect the impact of that law on us 

table of contents we prorate our items of income  gain  loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month  instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could change the allocation of items of income  gain  loss and deduction among our unitholders 
we prorate our items of income  gain  loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month  instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred 
the use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing treasury regulations 
if the irs were to challenge this method or new treasury regulations were issued  we may be required to change the allocation of items of income  gain  loss and deduction among our unitholders 
if the irs contests the federal income tax positions we take  the market for our common units may be adversely affected  and the cost of any contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to you 
we have not requested a ruling from the irs with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or any other matter affecting us 
the irs may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take 
it may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take 
a court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take 
any contest with the irs may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade 
in addition  our costs of any contest with the irs will be borne indirectly by our unitholders and our general partner because the costs will reduce our cash available for distribution 
you may be required to pay taxes on your share of our income even if you do not receive any cash distributions from us 
because our unitholders are treated as partners to whom we will allocate taxable income which could be different in amount than the cash we distribute  you may be required to pay any federal income taxes and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on your share of our taxable income even if you receive no cash distributions from us 
you may not receive cash distributions from us equal to your share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income 
tax gain or loss on disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected 
if you sell your common units  you will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and your tax basis in those common units 
prior distributions to you in excess of the total net taxable income you were allocated for a common unit  which decreased your tax basis in that common unit  will  in effect  become taxable income to you if the common unit is sold at a price greater than your tax basis in that common unit  even if the price you receive is less than your original cost 
a substantial portion of the amount realized  whether or not representing gain  may be ordinary income due to potential recapture items  including depreciation recapture 
in addition  because the amount realized includes a unitholder s share of our non recourse liabilities  if you sell your units  you may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash you receive from the sale 
tax exempt entities and non united states persons face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them 
investment in common units by tax exempt entities  such as individual retirement accounts known as iras  other retirement plans and non united states persons raises issues unique to them 
for example  virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax  including iras and other retirement plans  will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them 
distributions to non united states persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate  and non united states persons will be required to file united states federal tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income 
if you are a tax exempt entity or a non united states person  you should consult your tax advisor before investing in our common units 

table of contents we treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the actual common units purchased 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of the common units 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and because of other reasons  we will adopt depreciation and amortization positions that may not conform to all aspects of existing treasury regulations and may result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions 
a successful irs challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to you 
it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to your tax returns 
a unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of those units 
if so  he would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition 
because a unitholder whose units are loaned to a short seller to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units  he may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition 
moreover  during the period of the loan to the short seller  any of our income  gain  loss or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income 
unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units 
we have adopted certain valuation methodologies that may result in a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between the general partner and the unitholders 
the irs may challenge this treatment  which could adversely affect the value of our common units 
when we issue additional units or engage in certain other transactions  we will determine the fair market value of our assets and allocate any unrealized gain or loss attributable to our assets to the capital accounts of our unitholders and our general partner 
our methodology may be viewed as understating the value of our assets 
in that case  there may be a shift of income  gain  loss and deduction between certain unitholders and the general partner  which may be unfavorable to such unitholders 
moreover  under our valuation methods  subsequent purchasers of common units may have a greater portion of their internal revenue code section b adjustment allocated to our tangible assets and a lesser portion allocated to our intangible assets 
the irs may challenge our valuation methods  or our allocation of the section b adjustment attributable to our tangible and intangible assets  and allocations of income  gain  loss and deduction between the general partner and certain of our unitholders 
a successful irs challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders 
it also could affect the amount of gain from our unitholders sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions 
the sale or exchange of or more of our capital and profits interests during any twelve month period will result in the termination of our partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we will be considered to have terminated our partnership for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelve month period 
our termination would  among other things  result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders  which would result in us filing two tax returns and our unitholders could receive two schedules k for one fiscal year and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income 
in the case of a unitholder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending december  the closing 
table of contents of our taxable year may also result in more than twelve months of our taxable income or loss being includable in his taxable income for the year of termination 
our termination currently would not affect our classification as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  but instead  we would be treated as a new partnership for tax purposes 
if treated as a new partnership  we must make new tax elections and could be subject to penalties if we are unable to determine that a termination occurred 
you may be subject to foreign  state and local taxes and return filing requirements in jurisdictions where you do not live as a result of investing in our common units 
in addition to federal income taxes  you might be subject to return filing requirements and other taxes  including foreign  state and local taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property  now or in the future  even if you do not live in any of those jurisdictions 
further  you may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements 
we own assets and conduct business in the states of texas and louisiana 
currently  texas does not impose a personal income tax on individuals 
as we make acquisitions or expand our business  we may own assets or do business in states that impose a personal income tax 
it is your responsibility to file all united states federal  foreign  state and local tax returns

this number does not include unitholders whose units are held in trust by other entities 
the actual number of unitholders is greater than the number of holders of record 
we have also issued  subordinated units  for which there is no established public trading market 
the subordinated units are held by affiliates of targa resources gp llc  our general partner 
our general partner and its affiliates will receive a quarterly distribution on these units only after sufficient funds have been paid to the common units 
distributions of available cash general 
our partnership agreement requires that  within days after the end of each quarter  we distribute all of our available cash to unitholders of record on the applicable record date  as determined by our general partner 
definition of available cash 
the term available cash  for any quarter  means all cash and cash equivalents on hand on the date of determination of available cash for that quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner to provide for the proper conduct of our business  comply with applicable law  any of our debt instruments or other agreements  or provide funds for distribution to our unitholders and to our general partner for any one or more of the next four quarters 
minimum quarterly distribution 
we will distribute to the holders of common units and subordinated units on a quarterly basis at least the minimum quarterly distribution of per unit  or per unit on an annualized basis  to the extent we have sufficient cash from our operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses  including payments to our general partner 
however  there is no guarantee that we will pay the minimum quarterly distribution on the units in any quarter 
even if our cash distribution policy is not modified or revoked  the amount of distributions paid under our policy and the decision to make any distribution is determined by our general partner  taking into consideration the terms of our partnership agreement 
the board of directors of our general partner has broad discretion to establish cash reserves that it determines are necessary or appropriate to properly conduct our business 
these can include cash reserves for future capital and maintenance expenditures  reserves to stabilize distributions of cash to our unitholders  reserves to reduce debt or  as necessary  reserves to comply with the term of any of our agreements or obligations 
we will be prohibited from making any distributions to unitholders if it would cause an event of default  or an event of default exists  under our credit agreement

during  we distributed to the holders of our common units and subordinated units on a quarterly basis a quarterly distribution of per unit  or per year 
for the fourth quarter of  a distribution of per unit  or per unit on an annualized basis  was declared on january   and was paid on february  general partner interest

this general partner interest is represented by  general partner units 
our general partner has the right  but not the obligation  to contribute a proportional amount of capital to us to maintain its current general partner interest 
the general partner s interest in these distributions will be reduced if we issue additional units in the future and our general partner does not contribute a proportional amount of capital to us to maintain its general partner interest 
incentive distribution rights 
our general partner also currently holds incentive distribution rights that entitle it to receive up to a maximum of of the cash we distribute in excess of per unit per quarter

table of contents item selected financial data selected financial and operating data on february   we had targa s ownership interests in the north texas system contributed to us 
on october   we acquired targa s ownership interests in the saou system and the lou system 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas  we accounted for these transactions as transfers of net assets between entities under common control 
for combinations of entities under common control  the purchase cost provisions as they relate to purchase business combinations involving unrelated entities of sfas explicitly do not apply  instead the method of accounting prescribed by sfas for such transfers is similar to the pooling of interests method of accounting 
under this method  the carrying amount of net assets recognized in the balance sheets of each combining entity are carried forward to the balance sheet of the combined entity  and no other assets or liabilities are recognized as a result of the combination that is  no recognition is made for a purchase premium or discount representing any difference between the cash consideration paid and the book value of the net assets acquired 
although in connection with our ipo  the north texas system was presented as our predecessor entity  as a result of our october acquisition of the saou and lou systems  the predecessor entity for us is now considered to be the net assets of the saou and lou systems as these were the first assets acquired by targa on april  therefore  subsequent to the contribution of the north texas system from targa on february   we recognized the assets and liabilities of the north texas system contributed to us at their carrying amounts historical cost in the accounts of the saou and lou systems the predecessor entity at the date of transfer 
the accounting treatment for combinations of entities under common control is consistent with the concept of poolings as combinations of common shareholder or unitholder interests  as all of the north texas system s equity accounts were also carried forward intact initially  and subsequently adjusted due to the cash consideration we paid for the acquired net assets 
in addition to requiring that assets and liabilities be carried forward at historical costs  sfas also prescribes that for transfers of net assets between entities under common control  all income statements presented be combined as of the date of common control 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements and all other financial information included in this report have been restated to assume that the transfer of the north texas system net assets from targa to us had occurred at the date when both the north texas system and the saou and lou systems met the accounting requirements for entities under common control october  
as a result  financial statements and financial information presented for prior periods in this report have been restated 
accordingly  our historical results include the historical results of the saou and lou systems acquired by targa effective april  for the years ended december   and  and the historical results of the north texas system acquired by targa effective november  subsequent to october  the financial and operating data as of and for the year ended december  are derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of targa 
targa s consolidated financial results for the year ended december  includes the results of operations for the eight and a half month period commencing with its april  acquisition of the predecessor business from conocophillips  combined with the acquisition related activities of targa for the period from january to april  the selected combined financial and operating data of the predecessor for the three and a half months ended april  and as of and for the year ended december  are derived from the audited financial statements of the predecessor business

non gaap financial measures adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and non cash income or loss related to derivative instruments 
adjusted ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors  commercial banks and others  to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  
table of contents our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector  without regard to financing or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
the economic substance behind management s use of adjusted ebitda is to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our indebtedness  and make distributions to our investors 
the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net cash provided by operating activities and net income 
our non gaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net cash provided by operating activities and gaap net income 
adjusted ebitda is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and has important limitations as an analytical tool 
you should not consider adjusted ebitda in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because adjusted ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities and is defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
management compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable gaap measures  understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into management s decision making processes 
operating margin 
we define operating margin as total operating revenues  which consist of natural gas and ngl sales plus service fee revenues  less product purchases  which consist primarily of producer payments and other natural gas purchases  and operating expense 
management reviews operating margin monthly for consistency and trend analysis 
based on this monthly analysis  management takes appropriate action to maintain positive trends or to reverse negative trends 
management uses operating margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations 
the gaap measure most directly comparable to operating margin is net income 
our non gaap financial measure of operating margin should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income 
operating margin is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and has important limitations as an analytical tool 
you should not consider operating margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because operating margin excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and is defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies  thereby diminishing its utility 
management compensates for the limitations of operating margin as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable gaap measure  understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into management s decision making processes 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results 
operating margin provides useful information to investors because it is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements  including such investors  commercial banks and others  to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector  without regard to financing or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities

you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our historical financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a delaware limited partnership formed by targa to own  operate  acquire and develop a diversified portfolio of complementary midstream energy assets 
we are engaged in the business of gathering  compressing  treating  processing and selling natural gas and fractionating and selling ngls and ngl products 
we currently operate in the fort worth basin in north texas  the permian basin in west texas and in southwest louisiana 

table of contents we are owned by our limited partners and by our general partner  targa resources gp llc  an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of targa 
our limited partner common units are publicly traded on the nasdaq stock market llc under the symbol ngls 
factors that significantly affect our results our results of operations are substantially impacted by changes in commodity prices as well as increases and decreases in the volume of natural gas that we gather and transport through our pipeline systems  which we refer to as throughput volume 
throughput volumes and capacity utilization rates generally are driven by wellhead production  our competitive position on a regional basis and more broadly by prices and demand for natural gas and ngls 
our processing contract arrangements can have a significant impact on our profitability 
we process natural gas under a combination of percent of proceeds contracts approximately of our gathered natural gas volumes  wellhead purchases keep whole contracts approximately of our gathered natural gas volumes  fee based contracts approximately of our gathered natural gas volumes and hybrid contracts approximately of our gathered natural gas volumes 
the percent of proceeds and keep whole contracts expose us to commodity price risk 
we attempt to mitigate this risk through hedging activities which can materially impact our results of operations 
please see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
actual contract terms are based upon a variety of factors  including natural gas quality  geographic location  and the competitive commodity and pricing environment at the time the contract is executed and customer requirements 
our gathering and processing contract mix and  accordingly  our exposure to natural gas and ngl prices  may change as a result of producer preferences  competition  and changes in production as wells decline at different rates or are added  our expansion into regions where different types of contracts are more common as well as other market factors 
for a more complete discussion of the types of contracts under which we process natural gas  please see item business market overview 
the historical financial statements of the saou and lou systems and the north texas system include certain items that will not materially impact our future results of operations and liquidity and do not fully reflect a number of other items that will materially impact future results of operations and liquidity  including the items described below affiliate indebtedness and borrowings 
affiliate indebtedness prior to our acquisition of the saou and lou systems and the contribution of the north texas system  consisted of borrowings incurred by targa and allocated to us for financial reporting purposes 
prior to targa s acquisition of the dynegy inc s interest in dynegy midstream services  limited partnership the dms acquisition  which included the north texas system  the predecessor business was financed through borrowings by targa and reflected allocated indebtedness on its balance sheet and allocated interest expense on its income statement 
a substantial portion of the dms acquisition was also financed through borrowings by targa 
following the october  dms acquisition  a significant portion of targa s acquisition borrowings were allocated to the north texas system  resulting in approximately million of allocated indebtedness and corresponding levels of interest expense 
this indebtedness was incurred by targa in connection with the dms acquisition and the entity holding the north texas system provided a guarantee of this indebtedness 
this indebtedness was also secured by a collateral interest in both the equity of the entity holding the north texas system as well as its assets 
in connection with our ipo  this guarantee was terminated  the collateral interest was released and the allocated indebtedness was retired 
on february   we borrowed approximately million under our credit facility 
the proceeds from this borrowing  together with approximately million of net proceeds from our ipo including  common units sold pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional common units  were used to repay approximately million of affiliate 
table of contents indebtedness and the remaining balance of this indebtedness was retired and treated as a capital contribution to us 
on october   we completed our acquisition of the saou and lou systems concurrently with the sale of  common units representing limited partnership interests in us for gross proceeds of million approximately million after underwriting discount and structuring fees 
the net proceeds from the sale of the  units were used to pay approximately million in expenses associated with the sale of the common units  and million to targa for certain hedge transactions associated with the saou and lou systems 
we used the net proceeds after offering expenses and the hedge transactions of million along with net borrowings of million to pay approximately million of the acquisition costs of the saou and lou systems 
the allocated indebtedness from targa related to the saou and lou systems was million 
targa debt was guaranteed by the entities that own the saou and lou systems and was secured by a collateral interest in both the equity interests of those entities as well as their underlying assets 
in conjunction with our acquisition of the saou and lou systems  this guarantee was terminated  the collateral interest was released and the allocated indebtedness was retired 
on november   the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional  common units 
the gross proceeds from the underwriters exercise of their option to purchase additional common units were million approximately million after underwriting discounts 
the proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters option were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
concurrent with the acquisition of the saou and lou systems  we entered into a commitment increase supplement the supplement to our existing five year million senior secured revolving credit facility 
the supplement increased the aggregate commitment under our credit agreement by million to an aggregate of million 
on october   we entered into the first amendment to credit agreement the amendment 
the amendment increased by million the maximum amount of increases to the aggregate commitments that may be requested by us 
the amendment allows us to request commitments under our credit agreement  as supplemented and amended  of up to billion 
impact of our hedging activities 
in an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows  we have hedged the commodity price associated with a portion of our expected natural gas  ngls and condensate equity volumes for the years through by entering into derivative financial instruments including swaps and purchased puts or floors 
with these arrangements  we have attempted to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements with respect to our forecasted volumes for this period

general and administrative expenses 
prior to the contribution of the assets of the north texas system to us and the acquisition of the assets from the saou and lou systems by us from targa  general and administrative expenses were allocated from targa to the north texas  saou and lou systems in accordance with the general and administrative expenses allocation policies of targa 
on february   we entered into an omnibus agreement with targa  pursuant to which our allocated general and administrative expenses related to the north texas system are capped at million per year for three years  subject to adjustment 
for a more complete description of this agreement  see item certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence omnibus agreement 
in addition to these allocated general and administrative expenses  we incur incremental general and administrative expenses as a result of operating as a separate publicly held limited partnership 
these direct  incremental general and administrative expenses of approximately million for the year ended december   including one time expenses associated with our equity offerings  financing arrangements and acquisitions  are not subject to the cap contained in the omnibus agreement 
these costs include costs associated with annual and quarterly reports to unitholders  tax return and schedule k preparation and distribution  incremental independent auditor fees  registrar and transfer 
table of contents agent fees and independent director compensation 
these incremental general and administrative expenditures are not reflected in the historical financial statements of the north texas  saou and lou systems 
on october   we amended and restated our omnibus agreement with targa the amended and restated omnibus agreement 
the amended and restated omnibus agreement governs certain relationships between targa and us  including i 
targa s obligation to provide certain general and administrative services to us  ii 
our obligation to reimburse targa and its affiliates for the provision of general and administrative services a subject to a cap of million relating solely to the north texas system in the first year  with increases in the subsequent two years based on a formula specified in the amended and restated omnibus agreement and b fully allocated as to the saou and lou systems according to targa s previously established allocation practices  iii 
our obligation to reimburse targa and its affiliates for direct expenses incurred on our behalf  and iv 
targa s obligation to indemnify us for certain liabilities and our obligation to indemnify targa for certain liabilities 
allocated general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
working capital adjustments 
prior to our ipo and the contribution of the north texas system in february and the acquisition of the saou and lou systems in october  all intercompany transactions  including commodity sales and expense reimbursements  were not cash settled with the predecessor business respective parent  but were recorded as an adjustment to parent equity on the balance sheet 
the primary intercompany transactions between the respective parent and the predecessor business are natural gas and ngl sales  the provision of operations and maintenance activities and the provision of general and administrative services 
accordingly  the working capital of the predecessor business does not reflect any affiliate accounts receivable for intercompany commodity sales or affiliate accounts payable for the personnel and services provided or paid for by the applicable parent on behalf of the predecessor business 
distributions to our unitholders 
we intend to make cash distributions to our unitholders and our general partner at least at the minimum quarterly distribution rate of per common unit per quarter per common unit on an annualized basis 
on january   a cash distribution of per common unit per common unit on an annualized basis was declared for the fourth quarter of due to our cash distribution policy  we expect that we will distribute to our unitholders most of the cash generated by our operations 
as a result  we expect that we will rely upon external financing sources  including other debt and common unit issuances  to fund our acquisition and expansion capital expenditures  as well as our working capital needs 
historically  we have relied on internally generated cash flows for these purposes 
due to the timing of our ipo  a pro rated distribution for the first quarter of of per common unit was paid

table of contents general trends and outlook we expect our business to continue to be affected by the following key trends 
our expectations are based on assumptions made by us and information currently available to us 
to the extent our underlying assumptions about or interpretations of available information prove to be incorrect  our actual results may vary materially from our expected results 
natural gas supply and outlook 
fluctuations in energy prices can affect production rates and investments by third parties in the development of new natural gas reserves 
generally  drilling and production activity will increase as natural gas prices increase 
in  the prices we realized for natural gas decreased to an average of per mmbtu from an average of per mmbtu for for  the prices we realized for natural gas declined to an average of per mmbtu from an average of per mmbtu for we believe that current natural gas prices will continue to cause relatively high levels of natural gas related drilling in our systems as producers seek to increase their level of natural gas production 
commodity prices 
our operating income generally improves in an environment of higher natural gas and ngl prices  primarily as a result of our percent of proceeds contracts 
for  excluding the impact of hedging activities  we sold an average of bbtu d of residue gas at an average price of per mmbtu  as compared to bbtu d at an average price of per mmbtu for  and bbtu d at an average price of per mmbtu for for  we sold an average of mbbl d of ngls at an average price of per bbl  as compared to mbbl d at an average price of per bbl for  and mbbl d at an average price of per bbl for our processing profitability is largely dependent upon pricing and market demand for natural gas  ngls and condensate  which are beyond our control and have been volatile 
in a declining commodity price environment  without taking into account our hedges  we will realize a reduction in cash flows under our percent of proceeds contracts proportionate to average price declines 
we have attempted to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements by entering into hedging arrangements 
for additional information regarding our hedging activities  please see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
rising operating costs 
the current high levels of natural gas exploration  development and production activities are increasing competition for personnel and equipment 
this increased competition is placing upward pressure on the prices we pay for labor  supplies  property  plant and equipment 
we attempt to recover increased costs from our customers 
to the extent we are unable to procure necessary supplies or to recover higher costs  our operating results will be negatively impacted 
our operations our results of operations are determined primarily by the volumes of natural gas gathered  compressed  treated  processed  transported and sold through our gathering  processing and pipeline systems  the volumes of ngls and residue natural gas sold  and the level of natural gas and ngl prices 
we generate our revenues and our operating margins principally under percent of proceeds contractual arrangements 
under these arrangements  we generally gather natural gas from producers at the wellhead or central delivery points  transport the wellhead natural gas through our gathering system  treat and process the natural gas  and then sell the resulting residue natural gas and ngls at index prices based on published index market prices 
we remit to the producers either an agreed upon percentage of recovered volumes or the actual proceeds that we receive from our sales of the residue natural gas and ngls or an agreed upon percentage of the proceeds based on index related prices for the natural gas and ngls 
under these types of arrangements  our revenues correlate directly with the price of natural gas and ngls 
for the year ended december   our percent of proceeds activities accounted for approximately of our natural gas throughput volumes 
the balance of our throughput volumes are processed under wellhead purchase contracts  keep whole contracts  fee based contracts and hybrid contractual arrangements 
we sell all of our processed natural gas  ngls and high pressure condensate to targa at market based rates pursuant to natural gas  ngl and condensate purchase agreements 
low pressure condensate is sold to third parties 
for a more complete description of these arrangements  please see item certain relationships and related transactions and director independence and item business market access 

table of contents how we evaluate our operations our profitability is a function of the difference between the revenues we receive from our operations  including revenues from the natural gas  ngls and condensate we sell  and the costs associated with conducting our operations  including the costs of wellhead natural gas that we purchase as well as operating and general and administrative costs 
because commodity price movements tend to impact both revenues and costs  increases or decreases in our revenues alone are not necessarily indicative of increases or decreases in our profitability 
our contract portfolio  the prevailing pricing environment for natural gas and ngls and the natural gas and ngl throughput on our system are important factors in determining our profitability 
our profitability is also affected by the ngl content in gathered wellhead natural gas  demand for our products and changes in our customer mix 
our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance 
these measurements include the following throughput volumes  facility efficiencies and fuel consumption  operating margin  operating expenses  general and administrative expenses  adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow 
throughput volumes  facility efficiencies and fuel consumption 
our profitability is impacted by our ability to add new sources of natural gas supply to offset the natural decline of existing volumes from natural gas wells that are connected to our systems 
this is achieved by connecting new wells as well as by capturing supplies currently gathered by third parties 
in addition  we seek to increase operating margins by limiting volume losses and reducing fuel consumption by increasing compression efficiency 
with our gathering systems extensive use of remote monitoring capabilities  we monitor the volumes of natural gas received at the wellhead or central delivery points along our gathering systems  the volume of natural gas received at our processing plant inlets and the volumes of ngls and residue natural gas recovered by our processing plants 
this information is tracked through our processing plants to determine customer settlements and helps us increase efficiency and reduce fuel consumption 
as part of monitoring the efficiency of our operations  we measure the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the wellhead or central delivery points on our gathering systems and the volume received at the inlet of our processing plants as an indicator of fuel consumption and line loss 
we also track the difference between the volume of natural gas received at the inlet of the processing plant and the ngls and residue gas produced at the outlet of such plants to monitor the fuel consumption and recoveries of the facilities 
these volume  recovery and fuel consumption measurements are an important part of our operational efficiency analysis 
operating margin 
we review performance based on the non generally accepted accounting principle non gaap financial measure of operating margin 
we define operating margin as total operating revenues  which consist of natural gas and ngl sales plus service fee revenues  less product purchases  which consist primarily of producer payments and other natural gas purchases  and operating expense 
natural gas and ngl sales revenue includes settlement gains and losses on commodity hedges 
our operating margin is impacted by volumes and commodity prices as well as by our contract mix and hedging program  which are described in more detail below 
we view our operating margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations 
we review our operating margin monthly for consistency and trend analysis 
the gaap measure most directly comparable to operating margin is net income 
our non gaap financial measure of operating margin should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income 
operating margin is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and has important limitations as an analytical tool 
you should not consider operating margin in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because operating margin excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and is defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies  thereby diminishing its utility 
we compensate for the limitations of operating margin as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable gaap measure  understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into our decision making processes 

table of contents we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results 
operating margin provides useful information to investors because it is used as a supplemental financial measure by us and by external users of our financial statements  including such investors  commercial banks and others  to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector  without regard to financing or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
operating expenses 
operating expenses are costs associated with the operation of a specific asset 
direct labor  ad valorem taxes  repair and maintenance  utilities and contract services compose the most significant portion of our operating expenses 
these expenses generally remain relatively stable independent of the volumes through our systems but fluctuate depending on the scope of the activities performed during a specific period 
adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is another non gaap financial measure that is used by us 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization and non cash income or loss related to derivative instruments 
adjusted ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by us and by external users of our financial statements such as investors  commercial banks and others  to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  our operating performance and return on capital as compared to other companies in the midstream energy sector  without regard to financing or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
the economic substance behind our use of adjusted ebitda is to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our indebtedness  and make distributions to our investors 
the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net cash provided by operating activities and net income 
our non gaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net cash provided by operating activities and gaap net income 
adjusted ebitda is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and has important limitations as an analytical tool 
you should not consider adjusted ebitda in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
because adjusted ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities and is defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
we compensate for the limitations of adjusted ebitda as an analytical tool by reviewing the comparable gaap measures  understanding the differences between the measures and incorporating these insights into our decision making processes

distributable cash flow is a significant performance metric used by us and by external users of our financial statements  such as investors  commercial banks  research analysts and others to compare basic cash flows generated by us prior to the establishment of any retained cash reserves by the board of directors of our general partner to the cash distributions we expect to pay our unitholders 
using this metric  management can quickly compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to planned cash distributions 
distributable cash flow is also an important non gaap financial measure for our unitholders since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on investment 
specifically  this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we are generating cash flow at a level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly distribution rates 
distributable cash flow is also a quantitative standard used throughout the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships and limited 
table of contents liability companies because the value of a unit of such an entity is generally determined by the unit s yield which in turn is based on the amount of cash distributions the entity pays to a unitholder 
the economic substance behind our use of distributable cash flow is to measure the ability of our assets to generate cash flow sufficient to make distributions to our investors 
the gaap measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net income 
our non gaap measure of distributable cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to gaap net income 
distributable cash flow is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap and has important limitations as an analytical tool 
you should not consider distributable cash flow in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap

table of contents contract mix we generate revenue based on the contractual arrangements we have with our producer customers 
these arrangements can be in many forms which vary in the amount of commodity price risk they carry 
substantially all of our revenues are generated under percent of proceeds arrangements pursuant to which we receive a portion of the natural gas and or ngls as payment for services  please see item business midstream sector overview for a more detailed discussion of the contractual arrangements under which we operate 
set forth below is a table summarizing our average contract mix for the year ended december   including the potential impacts of changes in commodity prices on operating margins percent of contract type throughput impact of commodity prices percent of proceeds decreases in natural gas and or ngl prices generate decreases in operating margin 
wellhead purchases keep whole increases in natural gas prices relative to ngl prices generate decreases in operating margin 
decreases in ngl prices relative to natural gas prices generate decreases in operating margin 
hybrid in periods of favorable processing economics  similar to percent of liquids or wellhead purchases keep whole in some circumstances  if economically advantageous to the processor 
in periods of unfavorable processing economics  similar to fee based 
fee based no direct impact from commodity price movements 
at times  producer preferences  competitive forces and other factors cause us to enter into more commodity price sensitive contracts  such as wellhead purchases and keep whole arrangements 
we prefer to enter into contracts with less commodity price sensitivity  including fee based and percent of proceeds arrangements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the policies and estimates discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements  because their application requires the most significant judgments from management in estimating matters for financial reporting that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition 
the partnership s primary types of sales and service activities reported as operating revenues include sales of natural gas  ngls and condensate  and natural gas processing  from which we generate revenues through the compression  gathering  treating  and processing of natural gas 
the partnership recognizes revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an exchange arrangement exists  if applicable  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for processing services  the partnership receives either fees or a percentage of commodities as payment for these services  depending on the type of contract 
under percent of proceeds contracts  we receive either an agreed upon percentage of the actual proceeds that we receive from our sales of the residue natural gas and ngls or an agreed upon percentage based on index related prices for the natural gas and ngls 
percent of value and percent of liquids contracts are variations on this arrangement 
under keep whole contracts  we keep the ngls extracted and return the processed natural gas or value of the natural gas to the producer 
natural gas or ngls that the 
table of contents partnership receives for services or purchases for resale are in turn sold and recognized in accordance with the criteria outlined above 
under fee based contracts  the partnership receives a fee based on throughput volumes 
the partnership generally reports revenues gross in the consolidated statements of operations  in accordance with eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
except for fee based contracts  the partnership acts as the principal in the transactions where we receive commodities  takes title to the natural gas and ngls  and incurs the risks and rewards of ownership 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
estimates and judgments are based on information available at the time such estimates and judgments are made 
adjustments made with respect to the use of these estimates and judgments often relate to information not previously available 
uncertainties with respect to such estimates and judgments are inherent in the preparation of financial statements 
estimates and judgments are used in  among other things  estimating unbilled revenues and operating and general and administrative costs developing fair value assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates  analyzing tangible and intangible assets for possible impairment  estimating the useful lives of assets and determining amounts to accrue for contingencies  guarantees and indemnifications 
actual results could differ materially from estimated amounts 
property  plant and equipment 
property  plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated service lives of the partnership s functional asset groups are as follows asset group range of years natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities to office and miscellaneous equipment to expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
expenditures to refurbish assets that extend the useful lives or prevent environmental contamination are capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
upon disposition or retirement of property  plant  and equipment  any gain or loss is charged to operations 
our determination of the useful lives of property  plant and equipment requires us to make various assumptions  including the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons in the markets served by our assets  normal wear and tear of the facilities  and the extent and frequency of maintenance programs 
from time to time  we utilize consultants and other experts to assist us in assessing the remaining lives of the crude oil or natural gas production in the basins we serve 
we may capitalize certain costs directly related to the construction of assets  including internal labor costs  interest and engineering costs 
upon disposition or retirement of property  plant and equipment  any gain or loss is charged to operations 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we evaluate the recoverability of our property  plant and equipment when events or circumstances such as economic obsolescence  the business climate  legal and other factors indicate we may not recover the carrying amount of the assets 
we continually monitor our businesses and the market and business environments to identify indicators that may suggest an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate an asset for recoverability by comparing the carrying value of the asset with the asset s expected future undiscounted cash flows 
these cash flow estimates require us to make projections and assumptions for many years into the future for pricing  demand  competition  operating cost and other factors 
we recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value as determined by quoted market prices in active markets or present value techniques if quotes are unavailable 
the determination of the fair value using present value techniques requires us to make projections and assumptions regarding the probability of a range of outcomes and the rates of interest used in the present value calculations 

table of contents any changes we make to these projections and assumptions could result in significant revisions to our evaluation of recoverability of our property  plant and equipment and the recognition of an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of operations 
price risk management hedging 
the partnership accounts for derivative instruments in accordance with sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
under sfas  all derivative instruments not qualifying for the normal purchases and normal sales exception are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if a derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in earnings 
if a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting and is designated as a hedge  the effective portion of the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income oci  a component of partners capital  and reclassified to earnings when the forecasted transaction occurs 
cash flows from a derivative instrument designated as a hedge are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the item being hedged 
the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item must be highly effective in achieving the offset of changes in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk both at the inception of the contract and on an ongoing basis 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when a hedge instrument becomes ineffective 
gains and losses deferred in oci related to cash flow hedges for which hedge accounting has been discontinued remain deferred until the forecasted transaction occurs 
if it is probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  deferred gains or losses on the hedging instrument are reclassified to earnings immediately 
the partnership s policy is to formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
this process includes specific identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged item  the nature of the risk being hedged and the manner in which the hedging instrument s effectiveness will be assessed 
at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  the partnership assesses whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
hedge effectiveness is measured on a quarterly basis 
any ineffective portion of the unrealized gain or loss is reclassified to earnings in the current period 
asset retirement obligations 
under the provisions of sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations  we record legal obligations to retire tangible  long lived assets on our balance sheet as liabilities  recorded at a discount  when such liabilities are incurred 
we have recorded approximately million in asset retirement obligations as of december  in march  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation clarifies the definition and treatment of conditional asset retirement obligations as discussed in sfas a conditional asset retirement obligation is defined as an asset retirement activity in which the timing and or method of settlement are dependent on future events that may be outside the control of the company 
fin states that a company must record a liability when incurred for conditional asset retirement obligations if the fair value of the obligation is reasonably estimable 
this interpretation is intended to provide more information about long lived assets  more information about potential future cash outflows for these obligations and more consistent recognition of these liabilities 
our adoption of fin on december  had no effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets are used to compute depreciation expense  future asset retirement obligations and in impairment testing 
estimated useful lives are based  among other things  on the assumption that we provide an appropriate level of maintenance capital expenditures while the assets are still in operation 
without these continued capital expenditures  the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly 
estimated lives could be impacted by such factors as future energy prices  environmental regulations  various legal factors and competition 
if the useful lives of these assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation expense may increase  liabilities for future asset retirement obligations may be insufficient and impairments in carrying values of tangible and intangible assets may result

year ended december  compared to year ended december  total operating revenues 
revenues increased by million  or  to  million including million in losses related to net hedge settlements during compared to  million including million in losses related to net hedge settlements for this increase was primarily due to the following factors during  we recorded a full year of production volume for the saou  lou and north texas systems versus a full year of production volume for the saou and lou systems and only two months of production volume for the north texas system in  a net decrease attributable to prices of million  consisting of a decrease to natural gas revenues of million and increases to ngl and condensate revenues of million and million  respectively  a net increase attributable to volumes of million  consisting of increases to natural gas  ngls and condensate volumes of million  million and million  respectively  and an increase in fee and other revenues of million 
average realized prices net of the impact of hedging for our sales of natural gas decreased by per mmbtu including a increase per mmbtu due to hedging  or  to per mmbtu during compared to per mmbtu for ngls increased by per gallon with a increase per gallon due to hedging  or  to per gallon for compared to per gallon for condensate increased by per bbl increase per bbl due to hedging  or  to per bbl for compared to per bbl for natural gas sales volumes increased by bbtu d  or  to bbtu d during compared to bbtu d for this increase in sales of natural gas volumes was attributable to a full year of north texas sales volumes in compared to two months of sales volumes following our acquisition of north texas in  a net increase in natural gas purchased from affiliates and wellhead supplies attributable to additional well connections which were partially offset by the natural decline of field production 
the increase in condensate sales volumes was primarily due to the full year of production for the north texas system in compared to only tow months of ngl sales volumes increased by mbbl d  or  to 
table of contents mbbl d during compared to mbbl d for condensate volumes increased by mbbl d  or  to mbbl d during compared to mbbl d for the increases in both natural gas and condensate sales volumes were primarily due the full year of production for the north texas system in compared to only two months of product purchases 
product purchases increased by million  or  to  million for compared to  million for operating expenses 
operating expenses increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for again  the primary factor was the addition of a full year s operating expense for the north texas system in versus two months in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase is due primarily to the higher carrying value of property  plant and equipment of the north texas system for a full year in versus two months in general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the decrease was the result of lower allocated costs following the dms acquisition due to lower parent costs and to adjustments to the factors used to allocate general and administrative expense 
interest expense 
interest expense for was million compared to million for interest expense recorded for reflects an allocation of debt and related interest expense incurred by targa and allocated to the saou  lou and north texas systems in connection with debt incurred associated with the acquisitions made by targa 
interest expense for represents a full year of interest allocation related to the north texas system that was acquired as part of the dms acquisition in october  whereas interest expense for represents two months of allocated interest 
liquidity and capital resources our ability to finance our operations  including funding capital expenditures and acquisitions  to meet our indebtedness obligations  to refinance our indebtedness or to meet our collateral requirements depends on our ability to generate cash in the future 
our ability to generate cash is subject to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including commodity prices  particularly for natural gas and ngls  operating costs and maintenance capital expenditures 
please see item a 
risk factors 
historically  our cash generated from operations has been sufficient to finance our operating expenditures and maintenance and expansion capital expenditures  with remaining amounts being distributed to targa  during its period of ownership and to our unitholders since targa s contribution of assets to us and our acquisition of assets from targa 
our sources of liquidity include cash generated from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  issuance of additional partnership units  and debt offerings 
we believe that cash generated from these sources will be sufficient to meet our short term working capital requirements  long term capital expenditure requirements and our minimum quarterly cash distributions for at least the next year 
working capital 
working capital is the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities 
our working capital requirements are primarily driven by changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable 
these changes are impacted by changes in the prices of commodities that we buy and sell 
in general  our working capital requirements increase in periods of rising commodity prices and decrease in periods of declining commodity prices 
however  our working capital needs do not necessarily change at the same rate as 
table of contents commodity prices because both accounts receivable and accounts payable are impacted by the same commodity prices 
in addition  the timing of payments received by our customers or paid to our suppliers can also cause fluctuations in working capital because we settle with most of our larger suppliers and customers on a monthly basis and often near the end of the month 
we expect that our future working capital requirements will be impacted by these same factors 
prior to our ipo and the contribution of the north texas system in february and the acquisition of the saou and lou systems in october  all intercompany transactions  including commodity sales and expense reimbursements  were not cash settled with targa  but were recorded as an adjustment to parent equity on the balance sheet 
the primary transactions between us and targa are natural gas and ngl sales  the provision of operations and maintenance activities and the provision of general and administrative services 
as a result of this accounting treatment  our working capital does not reflect any affiliate accounts receivable for intercompany commodity sales or any affiliate accounts payable for the personnel and services provided by or paid for by our parent prior to the acquisition of the north texas system and the subsequent acquisition of the saou and lou systems 
we had positive working capital of million as of december   compared to negative working capital of million as of december  excluding the current portion of allocated debt that was retired by targa with proceeds received from the ipo  our negative working capital balance at december  would have been million 
this increase in the amount of working capital is attributable to operations of the larger organization and cash generated from their operations 
cash flow 
net cash provided by or used in operating activities  investing activities and financing activities for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  in millions net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase is attributable to a increase in our net income  increased non cash charges and increases in working capital balances 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to the inclusion of a full year of operations for the north texas system in  compared to only two months for  as the north texas system was acquired as part of the dms acquisition in october  and its net income  adjusted for non cash charges  as presented in the combined statements of cash flows and changes in working capital was only included for the period subsequent to the acquisition 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  increased million  or  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to the completion of gathering system expansion projects and higher major maintenance expenditures of million primarily due to the increased size of our gathering systems and the effect of higher utilization of our field compression facilities 
financing activities 
the net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  increased by million compared to the year ended december  this increase primarily reflects the proceeds from our equity offerings  borrowings under our credit facility  and deemed parent contributions prior to the contribution or transfer of assets to us  partially offset by payments of debt  offering costs  debt issuance costs related to our credit facility  distributions to our equity holders and payments to targa for assets transferred under common control 

table of contents capital requirements 
the midstream energy business can be capital intensive  requiring significant investment to maintain and upgrade existing operations 
a significant portion of the cost of constructing new gathering lines to connect to our gathering system is generally paid for by the natural gas producer 
however  we expect to incur significant expenditures during related to the expansion of our natural gas gathering and processing infrastructure 
we categorize our capital expenditures as either i maintenance expenditures or ii expansion expenditures 
maintenance expenditures are those expenditures that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets including the replacement of system components and equipment which is worn  obsolete or completing its useful life  the addition of new sources of natural gas supply to our systems to replace natural gas production declines and expenditures to remain in compliance with environmental laws and regulations 
expansion expenditures improve the service capability of the existing assets  extend asset useful lives  increase capacities from existing levels  reduce costs or enhance revenues 
year ended year ended year ended december  december  december  in millions capital expenditures expansion maintenance we estimate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million in given our objective of growth through acquisitions  expansions of existing assets and other internal growth projects  we anticipate that we will invest significant amounts of capital to grow and acquire assets 
expansion capital expenditures may vary significantly based on investment opportunities 
we expect to fund future capital expenditures with funds generated from our operations  borrowings under our credit facility  the issuance of additional partnership units and debt offerings 
description of credit agreement 
on february   we entered into a five year million senior secured revolving credit agreement the credit agreement and borrowed approximately million 
the proceeds from this borrowing  together with approximately million of net proceeds from the ipo including  common units sold pursuant to the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional common units  were used to repay approximately million of allocated indebtedness 
concurrent with the acquisition of the saou and lou systems on october   we entered into a commitment increase supplement the supplement to the credit agreement 
the supplement increased the aggregate commitments under the credit agreement by million to an aggregate of million 
we paid for our acquisition of the saou and lou systems with the proceeds from our offering of common units and borrowings under the increased credit agreement 
on october   we entered into the first amendment to credit agreement the amendment 
the amendment increased by million the maximum amount of increases to the aggregate commitments that may be requested by us 
the amendment allows us to request commitments under the credit agreement  as supplemented and amended the amended credit agreement  up to billion 
the amended credit agreement restricts our ability to make distributions of available cash to unitholders if we are in any default or an event of default as defined in the amended credit agreement exists 
the amended credit agreement requires us to maintain a leverage ratio the ratio of consolidated indebtedness to our consolidated ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement of no more than to  subject to certain adjustments 
the amended credit agreement also requires us to maintain an interest coverage ratio the ratio of our consolidated ebitda to our consolidated interest expense  as defined in the amended credit agreement of no less than to determined as of the last day of each quarter for the four fiscal 
table of contents quarter period ending on the date of determination 
in addition  the amended credit agreement contains various covenants that may limit  among other things  our ability to incur indebtedness  grant liens  and engage in transactions with affiliates 
any subsequent replacement of our amended credit agreement or any new indebtedness could have similar or greater restrictions 
in december  we entered into interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million 
at december   we had the following open interest rate swaps effective date expiration date notional amount index fixed rate  month usd libor  month usd libor  month usd libor  month usd libor each of these interest rate swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges of variable rate interest payments on a notional amount of million in borrowings under our amended credit agreement 
contractual obligations 
following is a summary of our contractual cash obligations over the next several fiscal years  as of december  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in millions debt obligations interest on debt obligations operating lease obligations capacity payments right of way asset retirement obligation represents interest expense on partnership debt  based on interest rates as of december  we used an average rate of to estimate our interest on variable rate debt obligations 
consists of capacity payments for natural gas pipelines 
available credit 
as of march   we had approximately million in capacity available under our amended credit agreement  after giving effect to outstanding borrowings of million and the issuance of million of letters of credit 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our principal market risks are our exposure to changes in commodity prices  particularly to the prices of natural gas and ngls  changes in interest rates  as well as nonperformance by our customers 
we do not use risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
commodity price risk 
a majority of our revenues are derived from percent of proceeds contracts under which we receive a portion of the natural gas and or ngls  or equity volumes  as payment for services 
the prices of natural gas and ngls are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply  demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control 
we monitor these risks and enter into 
table of contents hedging transactions designed to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations on our business 
cash flows from a derivative instrument designated as hedge are classified in the same category as the cash flows from the item being hedged 
the primary purpose of our commodity risk management activities is to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk and reduce fluctuations in our operating cash flow despite fluctuations in commodity prices 
in an effort to reduce the variability of our cash flows  as of december   we have hedged the commodity price associated with a significant portion of our expected natural gas  ngl and condensate equity volumes for the years through by entering into derivative financial instruments including swaps and purchased puts or floors 
the percentages of our expected equity volumes that are hedged decrease over time 
with swaps  we typically receive an agreed fixed price for a specified notional quantity of natural gas or ngls  and we pay the hedge counterparty a floating price for that same quantity based upon published index prices 
since we receive from our customers substantially the same floating index price from the sale of the underlying physical commodity  these transactions are designed to effectively lock in the agreed fixed price in advance for the volumes hedged 
in order to avoid having a greater volume hedged than our actual equity volumes  we typically limit our use of swaps to hedge the prices of less than our expected natural gas and ngl equity volumes 
we utilize purchased puts or floors to hedge additional expected equity commodity volumes without creating volumetric risk 
we intend to continue to manage our exposure to commodity prices in the future by entering into similar hedge transactions using swaps  collars  purchased puts or floors or other hedge instruments as market conditions permit 
we have tailored our hedges to generally match the ngl product composition and the ngl and natural gas delivery points to those of our physical equity volumes 
our ngl hedges cover baskets of ethane  propane  normal butane  iso butane and natural gasoline based upon our expected equity ngl composition 
we believe this strategy avoids uncorrelated risks resulting from employing hedges on crude oil or other petroleum products as proxy hedges of ngl prices 
additionally  our ngl hedges are based on published index prices for delivery at mont belvieu  and our natural gas hedges are based on published index prices for delivery at waha and mid continent  which closely approximate our actual ngl and natural gas delivery points 
we hedge a portion of our condensate sales using crude oil hedges that are based on the nymex futures contracts for west texas intermediate light  sweet crude 
our commodity price hedging transactions are typically documented pursuant to a standard international swap dealers association isda form with customized credit and legal terms 
our principal counterparties or  if applicable  their guarantors have investment grade credit ratings 
our payment obligations in connection with substantially all of these hedging transactions  and any additional credit exposure due to a rise in natural gas and ngl prices relative to the fixed prices set forth in the hedges  are secured by a first priority lien in the collateral securing our senior secured indebtedness that ranks equal in right of payment with liens granted in favor of our senior secured lenders 
as long as this first priority lien is in effect  we expect to have no obligation to post cash  letters of credit  or other additional collateral to secure these hedges at any time even if our counterparty s exposure to our credit increases over the term of the hedge as a result of higher commodity prices or because there has been a change in our creditworthiness 
a purchased put or floor transaction does not create credit exposure to us for our counterparties 

table of contents for the years ended december  and  our operating revenues were decreased by net hedge settlements of million and million  respectively 
during and  we entered into hedging arrangements for a portion of our forecast of equity volumes 
floor volumes and floor pricing are based solely on purchased puts or floors

our hedging arrangements provide us protection on the hedged volumes if prices decline below the prices at which these hedges are set 
if prices rise above the prices at which we have hedged  we will receive less revenue on the hedged volumes than we would receive in the absence of hedges 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily as a result of our variable rate debt under our credit facility 
to the extent that interest rates increase  our interest expense for our revolving debt will also increase 
as of march   there were borrowings of approximately million outstanding under our amended credit agreement 
because of the interest rate risk on our credit facility we entered into four interest rate swaps as of december  to reduce this risk  as shown below notional trade date term from to rate amount in thousands years  years  years  years  each swap fixes the three month libor rate  prior to credit margin  at the indicated rates for the specified amounts of related debt outstanding over the term of each swap agreement 
we have designated all interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses relating to the interest rate swaps are recorded in oci until the interest expense on the related debt is recognized in earnings 
a 
table of contents hypothetical increase of basis points in the underlying interest rate  after taking into account our interest rate swaps  would increase our annual interest expense by million 
credit risk we are subject to risk of losses resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers 
we operate under the targa credit policy and closely monitor the creditworthiness of customers to whom we grant credit and establish credit limits in accordance with this credit policy 
in addition to third party contracts  we have entered into several agreements with targa 
for example  we are party to natural gas  ngl and condensate purchase agreements that have terms of years pursuant to which targa purchases all of our natural gas  ngls and high pressure condensate 
in addition  we are also party to an omnibus agreement with targa which addresses  among other things  the provision of general and administrative and operating services to us 
as of september   moody s and standard poor s assigned targa corporate credit ratings of b and b  respectively  which are speculative ratings 
a speculative rating signifies a higher risk that targa will default on its obligations  including its obligations to us  than does an investment grade rating 
any material nonperformance under the omnibus and purchase agreements by targa could materially and adversely impact our ability to operate and make distributions to our unitholders
