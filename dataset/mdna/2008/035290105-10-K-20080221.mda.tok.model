critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes that the following are critical areas that either require significant judgment by management or may be affected by changes in general market conditions outside the control of management 
as a result  changes in estimates and general market conditions could cause actual results to differ materially from future expected results 
historically  the company s estimates in these critical areas have not differed materially from actual results 
allowance for doubtful accounts at december  and december   the company reported net accounts receivable of  million and  million  respectively 
each quarter the company segregates the doubtful receivable balances into the following major categories and determines the bad debt reserve required as outlined below customers that are no longer paying their balances are reserved based on the historical write off percentages  risk accounts are individually reviewed and the reserve is based on the probability of potential default 
the company continually monitors payment patterns of customers  investigates past due accounts to assess the likelihood of collection and monitors industry and economic trends to estimate required allowances  and the outstanding balance for customers who have declared bankruptcy is reserved at 
if circumstances related to the above factors change  the company s estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced increased by a material amount 
inventory obsolescence at december  and december   the company reported inventory of  million and million  respectively 
each quarter the company reviews the excess inventory and makes an assessment of the realizable value 
there are many factors that management considers in determining whether or not or the amount by which a reserve should be established 
these factors include the following return or rotation privileges with vendors  price protection from vendors  expected future usage  whether or not a customer is obligated by contract to purchase the inventory  current market pricing  historical consumption experience  and risk of obsolescence 
if circumstances related to the above factors change  there could be a material impact on the net realizable value of the inventory 
pension expense on december   the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
the effect of adopting sfas no 
was included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet at december  under the provisions of sfas no 
 balance sheet recognition of the funded status of a single employer defined benefit postretirement plan is required as an initial adjustment to the ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
subsequent changes in the funded status are recorded as a component of comprehensive income to the extent the changes have not yet been recognized as a component of net periodic cost pursuant to sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
 or sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas no 

see note pension plans  post retirement benefits and other benefits for further discussion of the effect of adopting sfas no 
on the company s consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
and the policies used by the company generally reduce the volatility of the net benefit cost from changes in pension liability discount rates and the performance of the pension plan s assets  as significant actuarial gains losses are amortized over the service lives of the plan participants 
a significant element in determining the company s net periodic benefit cost in accordance with sfas no 
is the expected return on plan assets 
the company has assumed that the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
this expected return on plan assets is included in the net periodic benefit cost 
the plan assets produced an actual return of approximately and in and  respectively 
if significant  the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is amortized over the service lives of the plan participants 

table of contents at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to discount the plan liabilities 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on relevant market indices citigroup pension liability index  moody s aa corporate bond yield and bloomberg aaa aa year 
these rates are adjusted to match the duration of the liabilities associated with the pension plans 
at december   the company determined this rate to be approximately on a consolidated basis 
as of december   the company s consolidated pension liability  net was million  down from million at the end of for the year ended december   the company recognized a consolidated pre tax net periodic cost of million  down from million in due to its long duration  the pension liability is very sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
as a result of an increase in the weighted average discount rate and other actuarial gains and losses  the company estimates its net periodic cost to decrease by approximately 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a basis point decline in the assumed discount rate would result in an increase in the pension expense of approximately million and an increase in the projected benefit obligations at december  of million 
deferred tax assets the company maintains valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances are included in the company s tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is warranted  management evaluates factors such as prior earnings history  expected future earnings  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
the reliability assessments made at a given balance sheet date are subject to change in the future  particularly if earnings of a particular subsidiary are significantly higher or lower than expected  or if management takes operational or tax planning actions that could impact the future taxable earnings of a subsidiary 
reserves for uncertain tax positions in the normal course of business  the company is audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  and is periodically challenged regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges relate to the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
management believes the company s tax positions comply with applicable tax law and the company intends to defend its positions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various tax filing positions  the company records reserves for uncertain tax positions  based upon the technical support for the positions  the company s past audit experience with similar situations and potential interest and penalties related to the matters 
management believes these reserves represent the best estimate of the amount that the company will ultimately be required to pay to settle the matters 
the company s effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if  upon final resolution with taxing authorities  the company prevailed in positions for which reserves have been established  or was required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves 
on december  the beginning of fiscal for the company  the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin requires that the tax benefit related to a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return of a company be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
accordingly  the cumulative effect of applying fin to preexisting tax positions of million was recorded as a decrease in the december  opening balance of retained earnings 
fin requires that  subsequent to initial adoption  a change in judgment that results in subsequent recognition  derecognition or change in a measurement of a tax position taken in a prior annual period including any related interest and penalties be recognized as a discrete item in the period in which the change occurs 
see note income taxes for further discussion of the effect of adopting fin on the company s consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the company has recorded a current income tax payable of million 
the aggregate amount of global income tax reserves and related interest recorded in current taxes payable was approximately million 
these reserves cover a wide range of issues and involve numerous different taxing jurisdictions 
the single largest item million relates to a dispute with the state of wisconsin concerning income taxes payable upon the sale of a short line railroad that operated solely within such state 
other significant exposures for which reserves exist include  but are not limited to  a variety of foreign jurisdictional transfer pricing disputes and foreign withholding tax issues related to inter company transfers and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to the impact of fluctuations in foreign currencies and interest rate changes  as well as changes in the market value of its financial instruments 
the company periodically enters into derivatives in order to minimize these risks  but not for trading purposes 
the company s strategy is to negotiate terms for its derivatives and other financial instruments to be perfectly effective  such that the change in the value of the derivative perfectly offsets the impact of the underlying hedged item 
any resulting gains or losses from hedge ineffectiveness are reflected directly in income 
approximately  and of the company s sales were denominated in foreign currency in  and  respectively 
the company s exposure to currency rate fluctuations primarily relate to canada canadian dollar and europe euro and british pound 
the company also has exposure to currency rate fluctuations related to more volatile markets such as australia dollar  brazil real  chile peso  mexico peso  and venezuela bolivar 
the company s investments in several subsidiaries are recorded in currencies other than the us dollar 
as these foreign currency denominated investments are translated at the end of each period during consolidation  fluctuations of exchange rates between the foreign currency and the us dollar increase or decrease the value of those investments 
these fluctuations and the results of operations for foreign subsidiaries  where the functional currency is not the us dollar  are translated into us dollars using the average exchange rates during the year  while the assets and liabilities are translated using period end exchange rates 
the related translation adjustments are recorded in a separate component of stockholders equity  foreign currency translation  which is a component of other comprehensive income 
gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in other  net in the consolidated statements of operations 
borrowings are raised in certain foreign currencies to minimize the exchange rate fluctuation risk 
as of december  and december   the company had a significant amount of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the reporting entity 
the absolute value of these assets and liabilities at december  and december   was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company has purchased approximately million of short term foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the effect of fluctuating foreign currencies 
as of december  and december   the company utilized interest rate agreements that effectively fix or cap  for a period of time  the gbp london interbank offered rate gbp libor and the bankers acceptance canadian dollar offered rate ba cdor components of the interest rates on a portion of its floating rate obligations denominated in those currencies 
as of december   the company also utilized an interest rate agreement that effectively fixes or caps  for a period of time  the eur london interbank offered rate eur libor component of the interest rate on a portion of its floating rate obligations denominated in euros 
at december   the company had interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a notional amount of gbp million  million canadian and euro million 
at december   the company had interest rate swap agreements outstanding with a notional amount of gbp million and million canadian 
the gbp libor swap agreements obligate the company to pay a fixed rate of approximately through july the ba cdor swap agreement obligates the company to pay a fixed rate of approximately through december and the eur libor swap agreement obligates the company to pay a fixed rate of approximately through july as of december  and december   as a result of these agreements along with fixed rate borrowing agreements  the interest rate on approximately and of debt obligations  respectively  was fixed 
the fair market value of outstanding interest rate agreements  which is the estimated amount that the company would have received to enter into similar interest rate agreements at the current interest rate  was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the impact of interest rate agreements to interest expense was minimal in  and the company does not enter into interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 

table of contents the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its derivatives and other financial instruments assuming a adverse change in interest rates and a adverse change in the foreign currency contracts outstanding 
holding all other variables constant  the hypothetical adverse changes would have increased interest expense by million and million in and  respectively  and decreased the value of foreign currency forward contracts by million and million in and  respectively 
if there were a percent adverse change in the exchange rates  the company would record a foreign exchange loss of approximately million 
the company s fixed rate debt primarily consists of the senior notes and convertible debt instruments specifically  the notes due and notes due 
the combined estimated fair market value of the company s outstanding fixed rate debt senior notes and convertible debt at december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the increase in the fair market value is due to the million issuance of the notes due as well as the increase in the company s stock price during the company s notes due bear interest at a fixed rate of 
therefore  changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on the notes due but interest rates do affect the fair value 
if interest rates were to increase by  the fair market value of the notes due would decrease by and for and  respectively 
if interest rates were to decrease by  the fair market value of the fixed rate debt would increase by and for and  respectively 
as of december  and december   the fair value was million and million  respectively 
the company has outstanding debt that may be converted into the company s common stock 
accordingly  the price of its common stock may affect the fair value of the company s convertible debt 
the estimated fair value of the company s outstanding convertible debt increased to million at december  from million at december  due to the issuance of the notes due as well as the increase in the company s stock price during a hypothetical decrease in the price of the company s common stock from the price at december  and december  would have reduced the fair value of its then outstanding convertible debt by million and million  respectively 
changes in the market value of the company s debt do not affect the reported results of operations unless the company is retiring such obligations prior to their maturity 
this analysis did not consider the effects of a changed level of economic activity that could exist in such an environment and certain other factors 
further  in the event of a change of this magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to possible changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure
