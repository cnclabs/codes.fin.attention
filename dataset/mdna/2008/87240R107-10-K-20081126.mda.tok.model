item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview our business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized and profitable financial institution dedicated to providing exceptional personal service to our customers 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully implement our business strategy 
since being organized in  we grew to become  prior to our initial public offering of stock in april  the nation s largest mutually owned savings and loan association based on total assets 
we credit our success to our continued emphasis on our primary values love  trust  respect  and a commitment to excellence  along with some fun 
our values are reflected in our pricing of loan and deposit products  as well as our home today program  as described below 
our values are further reflected in the broadway redevelopment initiative a long term revitalization program encompassing the three mile corridor of the broadway slavic village neighborhood in cleveland  ohio where our main office is located and the education programs we have established and or supported 
we intend to continue to support our customers 
the financial services industry continues to suffer high volatility and adverse financial conditions 
regionally high unemployment  widespread sub prime mortgage lending  slumping residential real estate values  illiquid capital and credit markets  and a general lack of confidence in the financial service sector of the economy as a result of recent bank failures present challenges for us 
more than of our assets consist of residential real estate loans and equity loans and lines of credit  the overwhelming majority of which were originated to borrowers in the states of ohio and florida 
we have increased these assets by offering competitive interest rates and product features to customers in our marketplace 
part of this strategy involves programs such as our lowest rate guarantee program in which we will offer a better interest rate than a competitor s interest rate for certain types of loans or give the loan applicant cash after they close a loan with another lender at a lower interest rate and our home today program where we provide our standard interest rates and flexible credit terms to borrowers who would not normally qualify for such loans 
we also offer loan products and features such as high loan to value loans that do not require private mortgage insurance  and adjustable rate mortgage loans that can convert to fixed rate loans at no cost to the borrower 
we cannot control many aspects of the markets in which we compete but we do control the products we offer 
we neither originate nor purchase any sub prime or option arm loans 
however  through its home today program  the association originates loans with standard terms to low and moderate income home buyers who might not qualify for such loans 
borrowers in the home today program are not charged higher fees or interest rates than non home today borrowers 
these loans are not interest only or negative amortizing and contain no low initial payment features or adjustable interest rates 
because the association applies less stringent underwriting and credit standards to these loans  loans originated under the home today program have greater credit risk than traditional residential real estate mortgage loans 
historically  we have tried to provide our customers with attractive rates of return on our deposit products 
our deposit products typically offer rates that are competitive with the rates on similar products offered by other financial institutions 
we intend to continue this practice 
our high yield checking and high yield savings accounts  which represented of our total deposits as of september   have provided us with funds that reprice in a manner similar to our equity lines of credit  which has assisted us in managing interest rate risk 
we continue to focus on managing operating expenses 
our ratio of non interest expense to average assets was for the fiscal year ended september   which was basis points less than our ratio of for the fiscal year ended september   with virtually all basis points of the decrease attributable to our million contribution to form the third federal foundation in the fiscal year ended september  as of september   our average assets per full time employee and our average deposits per full time 
table of contents employee were million and million  respectively  each of which is significantly higher than the averages for our peer group 
our average deposits held at our branch offices an average of million per branch office as of september  contribute to our expense management efforts by limiting the overhead costs of serving our deposit customers 
we will continue our efforts to control operating expenses as we use the capital we received in the stock offering to grow our business 
we expect to expand our branch office network 
our initial focus is in broward county  florida  where we opened a full service branch in plantation in september and expect to add up to three new locations in early  which will reduce eliminate gaps in our footprint in that market area 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that involve significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition and results of operations depend  and which involve the most complex subjective decisions or assessments  are our policies with respect to our allowance for loan losses  mortgage servicing rights  income taxes  pension benefits and stock based compensation 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is the amount estimated by management as necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date 
the amount of the allowance is based on significant estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change 
the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses is considered a critical accounting policy by management due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the assumptions used and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in changes to the amount of the recorded allowance for loan losses 
at september  the allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans 
an increase or decrease of in the allowance would result in a million charge or credit  respectively to income before income taxes 
as a substantial percentage of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate  appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans 
assumptions are instrumental in determining the value of properties 
overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly affect the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined 
management carefully reviews the assumptions supporting such appraisals to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans 
management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
we consider a variety of factors in establishing this estimate including  but not limited to  current economic conditions  delinquency statistics  geographic concentrations  the adequacy of the underlying collateral  the financial strength of the borrower  results of internal loan reviews and other relevant factors 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates by management that may be susceptible to significant change based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions 
the evaluation has a specific and general component 
the specific component relates to loans that are delinquent or otherwise identified as a problem loan through the application of our loan review process and our loan grading system 
all such loans are evaluated individually  with principal consideration given to the value of the collateral securing the loan 
specific allowances are established as required by this analysis 
the general component is determined by segregating the remaining loans by type of loan  risk weighting if applicable and payment history 
we also analyze historical loss experience  delinquency trends  general economic conditions and geographic concentrations 
this analysis establishes factors that are applied to the loan groups to determine the amount of the general component of the allowance for loan losses 

table of contents actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowances we have established which could have a material negative effect on our financial results 
mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights represent the present value of the estimated future servicing fees expected to be received pursuant to the right to service loans in our loan servicing portfolio 
mortgage servicing rights are recognized as assets for both purchased rights and for the allocated value of retained servicing rights on loans sold 
the most critical accounting policy associated with mortgage servicing is the methodology used to determine the fair value of capitalized mortgage servicing rights 
a number of estimates affect the capitalized value and include the mortgage loan prepayment speed assumption  the estimated prospective cost expected to be incurred in connection with servicing the mortgage loans  and the discount factor used to compute the present value of the mortgage servicing right 
the mortgage loan prepayment speed assumption is significantly affected by interest rates 
in general  during periods of falling interest rates  mortgage loans prepay faster and the value of our mortgage servicing assets decreases 
conversely  during periods of rising rates  the value of mortgage servicing rights generally increases due to slower rates of prepayments 
the estimated prospective cost expected to be incurred in connection with servicing the mortgage loans is deducted from the retained gross mortgage loan interest rate less amounts remitted to third parties investor pass thru rate  guarantee fee  mortgage insurance fee  etc 
servicing fee to determine the net servicing fee for purposes of capitalization computations 
to the extent that prospective actual costs incurred to service the mortgage loans differ from the estimate  our future results will be adversely or favorably impacted 
the discount factor selected to compute the present value of the servicing right reflects expected market place yield requirements 
the amount and timing of mortgage servicing rights amortization is adjusted monthly based on actual results 
in addition  on a quarterly basis  we perform a valuation review of mortgage servicing rights for potential decreases in value 
this quarterly valuation review entails applying current assumptions to the portfolio classified by interest rates and  secondarily  by prepayment characteristics 
income taxes 
we consider accounting for income taxes a critical accounting policy due to the subjective nature of certain estimates that are involved in the calculation 
we use the asset liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we must assess the realization of the deferred tax asset and  to the extent that we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
adjustments to increase or decrease the valuation allowance are charged or credited  respectively  to income tax expense 
during the fiscal year ended september   we reduced the required deferred tax valuation allowance with respect to the expected carry forward portion of our million charitable contribution expense incurred in conjunction with the formation of the third federal foundation from million to million 
although we have determined a valuation allowance is not required for any other deferred tax assets  there is no guarantee that those assets  nor the portion of deferred tax asset associated with the carryforward of our charitable contribution not subject to a valuation allowance  will be recognizable in the future 
pension benefits 
the determination of our obligations and expense for pension benefits is dependent upon certain assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation 
actual results could differ from the assumptions and market driven rates may fluctuate 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions could materially affect future pension obligations and expense 
stock based compensation 
we recognize the cost of associate and director services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of those awards in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment 
we estimate the per share value of option grants using the black scholes option pricing model using assumptions for expected dividend yield  expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected 
table of contents option term 
these assumptions are subjective in nature  involve uncertainties  and therefore cannot be determined with precision 
the per share value of options is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
in general  the per share fair value of options will move in the same direction as changes in the expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected option term  and in the opposite direction as changes in expected dividend yield 
for example  the per share fair value of options will generally increase as expected stock volatility increases  risk free interest rate increases  expected option term increases and expected dividend yield decreases 
the use of different assumptions or different option pricing models could result in materially different per share fair values of options 
comparison of financial condition at september  and total assets increased million  or  to billion at september  from billion at september  the growth in our assets was funded by a million increase in borrowed funds along with a million increase in deposits offset by a million decrease in retained earnings 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million  or  to million at september  from million at september   as we continued to redeploy our liquid assets into loan products that provide higher yields along with longer maturities 
investment securities available for sale decreased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  as a result of normal principal repayments 
no purchases of investment securities available for sale occurred in the current fiscal year 
investment securities held to maturity decreased million  or less than to million from million 
normal principal repayments and maturities more than offset purchases during the current fiscal year of million 
there were no sales of investment securities in the current fiscal year 
loans  net  comprised primarily of mortgage loans held for investment increased billion  or to billion at september  from billion at september  this increase is attributed to the decision to retain more of our mortgage loan originations in our owned loan portfolio and thereby redeploying cash and cash equivalents into higher yielding assets and further utilizing the capital raised in the initial public stock offering to fund growth 
our portfolio of real estate owned increased million  or  to million at september   from million at september  while the balance of real estate owned continues to comprise less than of both our billion of total assets as well as our billion loan portfolio  the increase is nevertheless indicative of the current challenging economic environment and its negative impact on the residential housing market  which has been evidenced by increases in the balances of non performing loans and loan charge offs 
foreclosed properties are recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value with charge offs  if any  charged to the allowance for loan losses upon transfer to real estate owned 
fair value is monitored quarterly and any subsequent decline in fair value of real estate owned is recorded as a loss and reported in other non interest expense 
if unemployment in ohio continues to rise in the future we expect the current high level of foreclosures will continue 
as a result  it is possible the balance of real estate owned will increase 
deposits increased million  or  to billion at september  from billion at september  the increase in deposits was the result of a million increase in high yield savings accounts a subcategory of our savings accounts along with a million increase in certificates of deposit  offset by a million decrease in our high yield checking accounts combined with declines in other deposit products other savings accounts and other now accounts in the current fiscal year 
our high yield savings account  the highest tier of which provides a competitive marketplace yield  was redesigned and actively marketed beginning in early march we have focused on promoting the high yield savings accounts as well 
table of contents as high yield checking accounts as we believe that these types of deposit products provide a stable source of funds 
in addition  our high yield checking and high yield savings accounts are expected to reprice in a manner similar to our equity loan products  and therefore assist us in managing interest rate risk 
the million increase in federal home loan bank advances can be attributed to a cash position in which we are a borrower 
that transition to the status of a borrower primarily reflected the growth in the amount of mortgage loans that we held in our portfolio which increased billion  absorbed billion of our balance of cash and cash equivalents  and was only partially funded by our billion increase in savings deposits 
we had no borrowed funds at the end of fiscal year borrowers advances for insurance and taxes increased million  or  to million at september  from million at september  this increase can be attributed to the real estate taxes which are collected from borrowers and held until they are remitted to the appropriate taxing agencies 
the million increase in principal  interest and related escrows owed on loans serviced  to million at september  from million at september   is related to the timing of when payments have been collected from borrowers for loans we service for other investors and when those funds are remitted to the investors and to the appropriate taxing agencies 
this increase is the result of a million increase in the retained tax payments collected from borrowers offset by a decrease of million of principal and interest 
accrued expenses and other liabilities increased million to million at september  from million at september  this change reflects the in transit status of million of real estate tax payments that have been collected from borrowers and are being remitted to various taxing agencies  a million payable related to the repurchase of common stock  a million increase in deferred compensation and accrued retirement and pension and a million increase in loss reserves at our subsidiary 
shareholders equity decreased million  to billion at september  from billion at september  this reflects million of net income during the current fiscal year reduced by million of repurchases of outstanding common stock and million in dividends paid on our shares of common stock other than the shares held by third federal savings  mhc and unallocated esop shares in the current fiscal year 
the remainder reflects adjustments related to the allocation of shares of our common stock related to the esop and adjustments to our accumulated other comprehensive loss attributable primarily to the change in our pension obligation 

table of contents analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income we earn on our interest earning assets and the expense we pay on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends on the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned on such assets and paid on such liabilities 
average balances and yields 
the following table sets forth average balance sheets  average yields and costs  and certain other information at and for the fiscal years indicated 
no tax equivalent yield adjustments were made  as the effect thereof was not material 
all average balances for the current fiscal year are daily average balances while the two prior fiscal year average balances are monthly average balances 
non accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances  but have been reflected in the table as loans carrying a zero yield 
the yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees  discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense

net interest earning assets represent total interest earning assets less total interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by total interest earning assets 

table of contents rate volume analysis 
the following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on our net interest income for the fiscal years indicated 
the rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume 
the volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate 
the net column represents the sum of the prior columns 
for purposes of this table  changes attributable to both rate and volume  which cannot be segregated  have been allocated proportionately  based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume

net income increased million to million in the twelve months ended september  as compared to million in the twelve months ended september  this increase is attributed primarily to the million pre tax contribution expense in the prior year related to the formation of the third federal foundation 
other factors that significantly impacted our earnings for the twelve month periods are described below 
interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million in the twelve months ended september  from million in the same twelve month period ended september  the increase in interest income resulted from increases in interest income on loans and mortgage backed securities partially offset by a decrease in interest income on federal funds 
interest income on federal funds sold was million in the fiscal year ended  compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease resulted from a million decrease in the average balance to million from million and lower market yields which were led by the actions of the federal reserve s open market committee  which lowered its federal funds target rate through a series of adjustments beginning in september and continuing through april the average yield on federal funds decreased basis points to from 
the lower average balance of federal funds reflects our deployment of lower yielding federal funds into higher yielding loan products and securities 
interest income on mortgage backed securities increased million  to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the average balance of mortgage backed securities increased million to 
table of contents million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in the average balance resulted primarily from reinvestment of the proceeds from our public stock offering 
the average yield on mortgage backed securities decreased basis points to compared to in the prior fiscal year 
interest income on loans increased million  or  to million from million when compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase can be attributed to a million increase in the average balance of loans to billion when compared to billion in the prior fiscal year as we have deployed cash balances of federal funds into higher yielding loan products and have also reinvested net cash inflows from deposits and borrowings into loan products 
this increase in interest income on loans was partially offset by a basis point decrease in the yield during the current fiscal year to from in the prior fiscal year which resulted primarily from the reduction in the prime rate of interest that benchmarks the yield on our equity lines of credit loans 
dividend income on federal home loan bank stock decreased million to million in the current fiscal year when compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the average balance of federal home loan bank stock was million  compared to million in prior fiscal year 
the million decrease in the average balance of federal home loan bank stock was the result of a redemption of excess shares in march interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in the fiscal year the decrease in interest expense resulted primarily from a decrease in interest expense on now accounts which was partially offset by an increase in interest expense on savings accounts 
interest expense on now accounts which includes our high yield checking accounts decreased million  or  to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was caused by a basis point decrease in the average rate we paid on now accounts to from in the prior fiscal year 
we decreased rates on deposits in response to decreases in short term market interest rates 
in addition  the average balance of now accounts decreased million  or  to billion from billion in the prior fiscal year as many customers converted their accounts to our new high yield savings products 
interest expense on savings accounts increased million  to million in fiscal year from million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase was caused primarily by a million increase in the average balance to billion from million along with a basis point increase in the average rate we paid to in the current fiscal year 
the increases in both average rate and average balance resulted primarily from the introduction in early march of a new high yield savings account that offers depositors a competitive yield 
net interest income 
net interest income increased by million  or  to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  the increase resulted primarily from the increase of million in average net interest earning assets  to billion in the current fiscal year from billion during the prior fiscal year  growth which was made possible by the capital raised from our initial public offering which was completed in april the increase in the average balance of net interest earning assets also favorably impacted our interest rate margin which increased to during the current fiscal year from during the last fiscal year 
moving in a contradictory manner however  was our net interest rate spread which decreased six basis points to for the current fiscal year from in the prior fiscal year 
that decrease resulted primarily from the turmoil in the financial markets related to the impact that losses on sub prime loans had on the ability of certain financial institutions to generate funding sources 
the challenges that those institutions faced in maintaining their funding sources  particularly in the wholesale markets  caused them to become extremely aggressive participants in the retail deposit gathering marketplace  and that aggression resulted in higher interest rates  particularly in shorter terms  offered to deposit customers 
in order to compete  retain customers and attract new customers  the 
table of contents company offered higher rates on its deposit products  and those higher rates had the net effect of preventing our cost of funds from decreasing as quickly as our yield on interest earning assets 
provision for loan losses 
we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date 
in determining the level of the allowance for loan losses  we consider past and current loss experience  evaluations of real estate collateral  current economic conditions  volume and type of lending  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay a loan and the levels of non performing and other classified loans 
the amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change 
we assess the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and make provisions for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance 
in recent months  increasing unemployment levels and rising fuel and food prices challenged our borrowers ability to repay their loans at a time when deteriorating housing prices  in part as a consequence of the sub prime mortgage market meltdown and the sale of foreclosed housing stocks by national mortgage lenders  make it difficult to sell their homes 
this limits the ability of many borrowers to self cure a delinquency 
we recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the twelve months ended september  and a provision of million for twelve months ended september  beginning as of june   with quarterly updates thereafter  the provision for loan losses reflect the results of our expanded loan level evaluation of equity lines of credit which are delinquent or more days 
the provisions recorded exceeded net charge offs of million and million for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
we expect that  as the equity lines of credit that were the subject of our expanded evaluation are resolved  we will realize an increase in net charge offs that will be applied against the allowance 
the allowance for loan losses was million or of total loans receivable at september   compared to million  or of total loans receivable  at september  we increased the allowance for loan losses to address the increased risk related to an increase in non performing loans  higher foreclosure rates  slumping residential housing values and in response to the results of our expanded evaluation of equity lines of credit delinquent days or more 
non performing loans increased by million to million  or of total loans  at september  from million  or of total loans  at september  we continue to use a consistent methodology in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
we believe we have recorded all losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate for the twelve months ended september  and non interest income 
non interest income decreased million to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  we had net gains of million on loan sales in the current fiscal year  compared to thousand of gains in the prior fiscal year 
net income on private equity investments decreased million  to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease primarily reflected the change in gains from the disposition of private equity fund investments in the current and prior fiscal years 
additionally  other non interest income decreased million  to million in the current fiscal year  from million in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease was due to a million gain recognized in connection with the sale  during fiscal year  of a commercial office building owned by our hazelmere subsidiary  a company that invests in commercial office buildings and leases them to unaffiliated parties 
rental income in the current fiscal year decreased million due to the sale of the aforementioned office building 
we also experienced a decrease of million due to the reduction in rebates from our official check provider when compared to the prior fiscal year 
non interest expense 
non interest expense decreased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  the decrease resulted primarily from the million  pre tax charitable contribution to the foundation made in conjunction with our public stock offering in april offset by increases in salaries and employee benefit expense  in federal insurance premiums  state franchise tax and in other operating expenses 

table of contents federal insurance premiums increased million to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  the use of available credits in the prior year kept the premiums paid lower when compared to the current year 
as result of the proposal adopted by the fdic on october   we expect the premiums paid in fiscal to increase significantly over the premiums paid in fiscal state franchise tax increased million  or to million from million in the same period last year 
state franchise tax in ohio  where our principal subsidiary operates  is calculated based on equity 
equity increased significantly as a result of the initial public stock offering and as a result our franchise tax liability increased 
real estate owned expense  net increased million  or  to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
this change can be attributed to the expenses  disposition costs and losses associated with real estate owned parcels acquired through foreclosure 
the foreclosure rate was higher  consistent with delinquency trends 
costs and losses were greater due to deteriorating property conditions and slumping housing values  linked we believe to wholesale dumping of housing stock by troubled national mortgage lenders 
this situation is likely to continue 
other operating expenses increased million  or  to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
costs associated with being a public company increased thousand  the provision for mortgage reinsurance claims at our captive insurance subsidiary increased thousand  expense to order credit reports increased thousand  and postage courier fees increased thousand 
income tax expense 
the provision for income taxes was million for the twelve months ended september   compared to million for the twelve months ended september   reflecting an million increase in pre tax income between the twelve month periods 
our effective tax rate was for the twelve months ended september  as compared to for the prior fiscal year 
our effective tax rate was below the federal statutory rate of in largely because of the beneficial effect of owning bank owned life insurance 
our effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory rate in because we established a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million related to the utilization of our charitable contribution deduction carryforward which arose in connection with our million contribution to third federal foundation 
comparison of operating results for the fiscal years ended september  and general 
net income decreased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  the decrease was attributable primarily to the million charitable contribution expense incurred in conjunction with the formation of the foundation which was created at the time of our initial public stock offering in april our results during fiscal included million of losses on the sale of loans 
other factors that significantly impacted our earnings for the twelve month periods are described below 
interest income 
interest income increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  the increase in interest income resulted from both a higher level of interest earning assets in most categories as well as higher average yields in most categories  as more fully discussed below 
interest income on federal funds sold was million for the twelve months ended september   compared to thousand for the twelve months ended september  the increase resulted from our maintaining higher levels of liquid assets during the twelve months ended september   as our average balance of federal funds sold was million for the twelve months ended september  compared to million for the twelve months ended september  the higher average balances resulted from the combined effect of significant loan sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the proceeds of our stock offering  which was completed in april  and the success of our deposit gathering efforts during the twelve 
table of contents months ended september  the average yield on federal funds sold remained relatively constant  only decreasing basis points to for the twelve months ended september  from for the twelve months ended september  interest income on mortgage backed securities increased million  to million for the twelve months ended september   compared to million for the twelve months ended september  the increase resulted primarily from increased balances and to a lesser extent  increased average rates of interest 
the increase in balances resulted from the reinvestment of proceeds from our public stock offering as well as proceeds from sales of first mortgage loans and the receipt of funds from new savings deposits 
the increased average rates of interest reflected the general trend of market interest rates 
interest income on loans decreased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended september   compared to million for the twelve months ended september  the decrease reflected the reduced interest income derived from smaller average balances which exceeded the beneficial impact of increasing interest rates  particularly on the variable rate equity line of credit loans 
the smaller average balance was due primarily to the sales of fixed rate mortgage loans during the latter part of fiscal  undertaken as part of our management of interest rate risk 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  the increase in interest expense resulted from increases in interest expense in each category of deposits  partially offset by a decrease in interest expense on federal home loan bank advances 
interest expense on now accounts  which includes our high yield checking accounts  increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  the increase was caused primarily by a basis point increase in the average rate we paid on now accounts to for the twelve months ended september  from for the twelve months ended september  we increased interest rates paid on deposits in response to increases in market interest rates 
in addition  the average balance of now accounts  comprised principally of our high yield checking accounts  increased million  or  to billion for the twelve months ended september  from billion for the twelve months ended september  the increase in now accounts reflects our customers pursuit of higher interest paying deposit products during a period of rising market interest rates 
interest expense on savings accounts and subscription proceeds increased million  to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  the increase was caused by a combination of a basis point increase in the average rate we paid on these accounts to for the twelve months ended september  from for the twelve months ended september   and a million increase in the average balance of these accounts to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  the increases in both average rate and average balance resulted primarily from the introduction in early march of a new high yield savings account that offered depositors very competitive yields 
the yield as of september  was 
the impact of subscription proceeds on interest expense was relatively modest million  for the fiscal year  of course  no impact during fiscal we increased rates on deposits in response to increases in market interest rates 
the increases in the balances of high yield checking and high yield savings accounts reflect our belief that these types of deposits provide a stable source of funds that re price in a manner similar to our equity loan products and therefore assist us in managing interest rate risk 
interest expense on certificates of deposit increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  
table of contents substantially all of the increase was caused by a basis point increase in the average rate we paid on certificates of deposit to for the twelve months ended september  from for the twelve months ended september  we increased rates on deposits in response to increases in market interest rates 
the average balance of certificates of deposit increased by million  or  to billion for the twelve months ended september  from billion for the twelve months ended september  interest expense on borrowed funds  which are comprised entirely of federal home loan bank advances  decreased million  to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  the decrease was caused by a decrease in our average balance of federal home loan bank advances 
the average balance decreased million to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  all repayments of federal home loan bank advances were made without incurring prepayment penalties 
net interest income 
net interest income decreased by million  or  to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  the decrease resulted from the compression of our interest rate spread and our net interest margin  as our interest rate spread decreased basis points to for the twelve months ended september  from for the twelve months ended september   and our net interest margin decreased basis points to for the twelve months ended september  from for the twelve months ended september  the decreases in our interest rate spread and net interest margin are consistent with an inverted us treasury yield curve 
from june  to june   the federal reserve board increased its target for the federal funds rate from to 
from june  through september  the target rate remained at 
then  on september  the target rate was reduced to 
while short term market interest rates which we use as a guide to price our deposits increased from mid through mid  longer term market interest rates which we use as a guide to price our longer term loans did not increase to the same degree 
the repricing of deposits generally lags behind changes in market rates since certificates of deposit do not reprice until their stated maturity date 
the compression in our net interest margin was partially offset by an increase in net interest earning assets which resulted primarily from the net proceeds of our initial public stock offering and to a lesser extent  from additional earnings during that time frame 
the average balance of our net interest earning assets increased million  to billion for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  provision for loan losses 
we establish provisions for loan losses  which are charged to operations  in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level we consider necessary to absorb credit losses incurred in the loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonably estimable at the balance sheet date 
in determining the level of the allowance for loan losses  we consider past and current loss experience  evaluations of real estate collateral  current economic conditions  volume and type of lending  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay a loan and the levels of nonperforming and other classified loans 
the amount of the allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from such estimates as more information becomes available or conditions change 
we assess the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis and make provisions for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance 
based on our evaluation of the above factors  we recorded a provision for loan losses of million for the twelve months ended september  and a provision of million for the twelve months ended september  the provisions recorded reflected net charge offs of million and million for the twelve months ended september  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans receivable  at september   compared to million  or of total loans receivable  at september  we increased the allowance for loan losses to reflect an increase in non performing loans from september  to september  nonperforming loans increased by million to million  or of total loans  at september  from million  or of total loans  at september  the increase in nonperforming loans occurred primarily in our residential real estate mortgage loan portfolio  and our equity loans and lines of credit 
of the million increase in 
table of contents non performing residential real estate loans  million pertained to loans originated through our home today program 
the million increase in our equity loans and lines of credit portfolio reflects the general economic slowdown as well as the softening of the residential real estate markets 
of our nonperforming loans  we had previously reported that we had one impaired loan with a principal balance of million 
during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended september   this loan was paid off and resulted in a charge off of thousand which was applied against a specific loan loss reserve of thousand that had previously been established for this loan 
we continue to use a consistent  conservative methodology in assessing the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
we believe we have recorded all losses that are both probable and reasonable to estimate for the twelve months ended september  and non interest income 
non interest income increased million to million for the twelve months ended september  from a loss of million for the twelve months ended september  the increase was primarily caused by our recognizing gains of thousand on loan sales for the twelve months ended september   compared to million of losses for the twelve months ended september  the increase was also caused by an increase in net income on private equity investments of million  to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  this increase primarily reflected gains from the disposition of private equity fund investments 
additionally  the other category increased million  to million for the twelve months ended september   from million for the twelve months ended september  this increase was due to a million gain recognized in connection with the sale  during  of a commercial office building owned by our hazelmere subsidiary  a company that invests in commercial office buildings and leases them to unaffiliated parties 
non interest expense 
non interest expense increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  the increase resulted primarily from the million charitable contribution to the foundation made in conjunction with our public stock offering in april and to a lesser extent from increases in salaries and employee benefit expense  in marketing expenses and in other operating expenses 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  of the changes in this category  the largest was an increase of million for the twelve months ended september  when compared to the twelve months ended september   for the funding of our employee stock ownership plan  with the remainder reflective of normal employee salary adjustments 
expenses associated with our marketing services increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  due primarily to new programs undertaken to promote our equity line of credit product 
contribution expense of million during the twelve months ended september   related to the formation of the foundation in conjunction with our initial public stock offering 
real estate owned expense  net increase million or  to million during the twelve months ended september  from thousand 
this increase  which includes the expenses  disposition costs and losses associated with real estate owned parcels can be attributed to an increase in foreclosures in the twelve months ended september  other operating expenses increased million  or  to million for the twelve months ended september  from million for the twelve months ended september  of the changes in this category  the largest was an increase of million during the twelve months ended september  when 
table of contents compared to the twelve months ended september  in the provision for mortgage reinsurance claims at our captive insurance subsidiary 
followed by an increase of thousand during the twelve months ended september  in legal and professional fees which primarily reflected the cost of preparing the organization for the reporting and disclosure requirements of a public company 
income tax expense 
the provision for income taxes was million for the twelve months ended september   compared to million for the twelve months ended september   despite a decrease in pre tax income between the twelve month periods 
our effective tax rate was for the twelve months ended september  as compared to for the twelve months ended september  and differs from the effective federal tax rate of for several reasons 
in fiscal  we established a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million related to the utilization of our charitable contribution deduction carryforward which arose in connection with our million contribution to the foundation 
this deferred tax asset valuation allowance increased our effective income tax rate by 
additionally  in fiscal  we transferred our tax domicile for the company from delaware to ohio and incurred ohio state income taxes an income that arose primarily from the reinvestment of our stock offering proceeds that increased our effective income tax rate by 
these two items were applicable to fiscal and did not exist during fiscal reducing our effective income tax rate in both fiscal and was the beneficial effect of our ownership of bank owned life insurance 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet current and future financial obligations of a short term nature 
our primary sources of funds consist of deposit inflows  loan sales  loan repayments  advances from the fhlb of cincinnati  and maturities and sales of securities 
in addition  we have the ability to obtain collateralized borrowings in the wholesale markets 
of course  in april  access to the equity capital markets had a dramatic impact on our liquidity as evidenced by the million net proceeds from our stock offering 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and mortgage prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the association s asset liability management committee is responsible for establishing and monitoring our liquidity targets and strategies in order to ensure that sufficient liquidity exists for meeting the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawals of our customers as well as unanticipated contingencies 
we seek to maintain a minimum liquidity ratio of or greater which we compute as the sum of cash and cash equivalents plus unpledged investment securities for which ready markets exist  divided by total assets 
for the fiscal year ended september   our liquidity ratio averaged 
we believe that we have enough sources of liquidity to satisfy our short and long term liquidity needs as of september  we regularly adjust our investments in liquid assets based upon our assessment of expected loan demand  expected deposit flows  yields available on interest earning deposits and securities and the objectives of our asset liability management program 
excess liquid assets are generally invested in interest earning deposits and short and intermediate term securities 
our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents 
the levels of these assets are dependent on our operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
at september   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
because we originate a significant amount of loans that qualify for sale in the secondary market  our loans held for sale represent highly liquid assets 
at september   we had million of loans classified as held for sale 
during the fiscal year ended september   we sold million of long term  fixed rate loans 
the recent placement of fannie mae and freddie mac under the control of the us treasury department has restored order and liquidity to this market and we expect to continue to be able to sell fixed rate loans 
investment securities classified as available for sale  which provide additional sources of liquidity  totaled million at september  also  at september  we had borrowed million from the fhlb of cincinnati 

table of contents our cash flows are derived from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities as reported in our consolidated statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
at september   we had million in loan commitments outstanding 
in addition to commitments to originate loans  we had billion in unused lines of credit to borrowers 
certificates of deposit due within one year of september  totaled billion  or of total deposits 
if these deposits do not remain with us  we will be required to seek other sources of funds  including loan sales  other deposit products  including certificates of deposit  federal home loan bank advances  or other collateralized borrowings 
depending on market conditions  we may be required to pay higher rates on such deposits or other borrowings than we currently pay on the certificates of deposit due on or before september  we believe  however  based on past experience  that a significant portion of such deposits will remain with us 
generally  we have the ability to attract and retain deposits by adjusting the interest rates offered 
our primary investing activity is originating residential mortgage loans 
during the fiscal year ended september   we originated billion of loans  and during the fiscal year ended september   we originated billion of loans 
we purchased million of securities during the fiscal year ended september   and million during the fiscal year ended september  financing activities consist primarily of activity in deposit accounts and  to a lesser extent  federal home loan bank advances 
we experienced a net increase in total deposits of million for the fiscal year ended september  compared to a net increase of million for the fiscal year ended september  deposit flows are affected by the overall level of interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by us and our local competitors  and by other factors 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if we require funds beyond our ability to generate them internally  borrowing agreements exist with the fhlb of cincinnati  which provide an additional source of funds 
at september  we had million of fhlb of cincinnati advances whereas at september  we had no outstanding advances 
during the fiscal year ended september   we had average outstanding advances with the fhlb of cincinnati of million as compared to million for fiscal year at september  we had the ability to immediately borrow an additional million from the fhlb of cincinnati 
from the perspective of collateral value securing advances  our capacity limit for additional borrowings from the fhlb cincinnati at september  was billion  subject to satisfaction of the fhlb cincinnati common stock ownership requirement 
to satisfy the common stock ownership requirement we would have to increase our ownership of fhlb cincinnati common stock by an additional million 
third federal savings and loan is subject to various regulatory capital requirements  including a risk based capital measure 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a definition of capital and a framework for calculating risk weighted assets by assigning balance sheet assets and off balance sheet items to broad risk categories 
at september   third federal savings and loan exceeded all regulatory capital requirements 
third federal savings and loan is considered well capitalized under regulatory guidelines 
the net proceeds from the stock offering significantly increased our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal over time  our current level of liquidity is expected to be reduced as net proceeds from the stock offering are used for general corporate purposes  including the funding of loans 
our financial condition and results of operations have been enhanced by the net proceeds from the stock offering  and have resulted in increased net interest earning assets and net interest income during the period following completion of the offering in april however  due to the increase in equity that resulted from the net proceeds of our stock offering  prospectively  our return on equity ratios will be adversely affected 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations commitments 
as a financial services provider  we routinely are a party to various financial instruments with off balance sheet risks  such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit 
while these 
table of contents contractual obligations represent our future cash requirements  a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans we make 
in addition  we routinely enter into commitments to securitize and sell mortgage loans 
for additional information  see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations 
in the ordinary course of our operations  we enter into certain contractual obligations 
such obligations include operating leases for premises and equipment  agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities and agreements with respect to investments 
the following table summarizes our significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations and other funding needs by payment date at september  the payment amounts represent those amounts due to the recipient and do not include any unamortized premiums or discounts or other similar carrying amount adjustments 
payments due by period contractual obligations less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years total in thousands federal home loan bank advances operating leases purchase obligations certificates of deposit private equity investments total commitments to extend credit includes accrued interest payable at september  includes the unused portion of equity lines of credit of billion 
the company provides mortgage reinsurance on certain mortgage loans in its own portfolio  including home today loans  and loans in its servicing portfolio through contracts with two primary mortgage insurance companies 
under these contracts  the company absorbs mortgage insurance losses in excess of a specified percentage of the principal balance of a given pool of loans  subject to a contractual limit  in exchange for a portion of the pools mortgage insurance premiums 
as of september   approximately million of mortgage loans in our portfolios was covered by such mortgage reinsurance contracts 
at september   the maximum losses under the reinsurance contracts were limited to million 
the company has incurred thousand in losses under these reinsurance contracts and provided a liability for estimated losses totaling million as of september  management believes it has made adequate provision for estimated losses 
the company is party to an equity investment sale agreement that in effect obligates the company to make a loan secured by equity securities 
in november  the company settled this commitment by originating a loan for million 
impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
the majority of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
consequently  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
in general  our assets  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  have longer maturities than our liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  our board of directors has established an asset liability management committee which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in our assets and liabilities  for determining the level of risk that is appropriate  given our business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity and performance objectives  and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
we have sought to manage our interest rate risk in order to control the exposure of our earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
as part of our ongoing asset liability management  we currently use the following strategies to manage our interest rate risk i securitizing and selling long term  fixed rate residential real estate mortgage loans  ii actively marketing adjustable rate loan products  with a focus on equity lines of credit  iii lengthening the weighted average remaining term of major funding sources  primarily by offering attractive interest rates on deposit products  iv investing in shorter to medium term securities  and v maintaining high levels of capital 
during  and  million  million and billion  respectively  of long term  fixed rate mortgage loans were securitized and sold 
these sales were undertaken to improve our interest rate risk position in the event that market interest rates increased 
shortening the average maturity of our interest earning assets by increasing our investments in shorter term loans and investments  as well as loans and investments with variable rates of interest  helps to better match the maturities and interest rates of our assets and liabilities  thereby reducing the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
by following these strategies  we believe that we are better positioned to react to increases in market interest rates 
net portfolio value 
the office of thrift supervision requires the computation of amounts by which the net present value of an institution s cash flow from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items the institution s net portfolio value or npv would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the office of thrift supervision provides all institutions that file a consolidated maturity rate schedule as a part of their quarterly thrift financial report with an interest rate sensitivity report of npv 
the office of thrift supervision simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option based pricing approach to measuring the interest rate sensitivity of npv 
historically  the office of thrift supervision model estimated the economic value of each type of asset  liability and off balance sheet contract under the assumption that the united states treasury yield curve increases or decreases instantaneously by to basis points in basis point increments 
however  in recent years  an npv calculation for an interest rate decrease of greater than basis points has not been prepared 
a basis point equals one hundredth of one percent  and basis points equals one percent 
an increase in interest rates from to would mean  for example  a basis point increase in the change in interest rates column below 
the office of thrift supervision provides us the results of the interest rate sensitivity model  which is based on information we provide to the office of thrift supervision to estimate the sensitivity of our npv 
the table below sets forth  as of september   the office of thrift supervision s calculation of the estimated changes in the npv of the association that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in 
table of contents the united states treasury yield curve 
computations of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including relative levels of market interest rates  loan prepayments and deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
change in interest rates basis points estimated npv estimated increase decrease in npv npv as a percentage of present value of assets npv ratio increase decrease basis points amount percent dollars in thousands assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
npv is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
npv ratio represents npv divided by the present value of assets 
the table above indicates that at september   in the event of an increase of basis points in all interest rates  the association would experience a decrease in npv 
in the event of a basis point decrease in interest rates  the association would experience a increase in npv 
the following table is based on the calculations contained in the previous table  and sets forth the change in the npv at a basis point rate of shock at september  and by regulation the association must measure and manage its interest rate risk for an interest rate shock of basis points  whichever produces the largest decline in npv 
at september  risk measure bp rate shock pre shock npv ratio post shock npv ratio sesitivity measure in basis points the following table presents our internal calculations of the estimated changes in the association s npv at september  and that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the united states treasury yield curve 
change in interest rates basis points npv as a percentage of present value of assets npv ratio at september  
table of contents assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities 
present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest earning assets 
npv ratio represents npv divided by the present value of assets 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in npv 
modeling changes in npv require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv tables presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assume that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv tables provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results 
additionally  both the estimates prepared by the ots as well as our internal estimates are significantly impacted by the numerous assumptions used in preparing the npv calculations 
in general  the assumptions used by the ots are  by necessity  more generic as their modeling framework must fit and be adaptable to all institutions subject to its regulation 
our internal model on the other hand  is tailored specifically to our organization which  we believe  improves the accuracy of our internally prepared npv estimates 
net interest income 
in addition to npv calculations  we analyze our sensitivity to changes in interest rates through our internal net interest income model 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
in our model  we estimate what our net interest income would be for a twelve month period using office of thrift supervision pricing tables for assumptions such as loan prepayment rates and deposit decay rates  and the bloomberg forward yield curve for assumptions as to projected interest rates 
we then calculate what the net interest income would be for the same period in the event of an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates 
as of september   we estimated that our net interest income for the twelve months ending september  would decrease by in the event of an instantaneous basis point increase in market interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in determining interest rate risk through changes in net interest income 
modeling changes in net interest income require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the interest rate risk information presented assumes that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although interest rate risk calculations provide an indication of our interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our net interest income and will differ from actual results
