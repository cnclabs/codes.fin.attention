item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we provide traffic and news information reports to radio and television stations in international markets 
we are the largest provider of traffic information reports to radio and television stations in australia and canada 
we also provide news information reports to radio stations in canada and we believe that we maintain the largest inventory of commercial advertising embedded in radio news reports in australia 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale to advertisers of commercial advertising inventory associated with these information reports 
we obtain this advertising inventory from radio and television stations in exchange for information reports and or  for certain broadcasters  cash compensation 
although we are a nevada corporation with principal executive offices located in new york  new york  we do not provide  nor do we intend to provide traffic or news reports to radio or television stations in the united states 
on march   we consummated an initial public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
our australian operations are conducted by australia traffic network 
prior to our initial public offering  australia traffic network was a separate entity which was controlled by the same shareholder base that controlled us 
immediately prior to our initial public offering  we completed the share exchange  at which time australia traffic network became our wholly owned subsidiary 
the share exchange notes  which were intended to cover the estimated tax consequences to the shareholders of australia traffic network  were paid in their entirety on the closing date of the initial public offering out of the net proceeds from such offering 
on may   the underwriter for the offering closed on its over allotment option to purchase an additional  shares at the price to public less underwriting commissions and discounts 
the net proceeds from our initial public offering  including from the shares sold pursuant to the underwriter s over allotment option  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses  was approximately million 
on july   we consummated a follow on public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock at a price to the public of per share 
the net proceeds from the follow on offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses  was approximately million 
our canadian operations are conducted by canadian traffic network  our indirect wholly owned subsidiary 
on october   we formed uk traffic network to operate our business in the united kingdom 
as of june   we provided traffic reporting services to eleven radio stations but did not generate any revenue from these contracts 
effective july   uk traffic network began providing service under a traffic radio service contract with the united kingdom s highways agency  which is an executive agency of the united kingdom department for transport responsible for operating  maintaining and improving the strategic trunk road network in england on behalf of the secretary of state for transport 
our responsibilities under this agreement include providing voice bulletins over digital audio radio stations throughout england  securing transmission agreements with digital audio stations and certain internet services 
on march   we formed mobile traffic network to pursue business opportunities related to a passive alerting technology for mobile phones for which we have filed for patent protection 
the technology  which has generated no revenue as of june   is designed to provide location aware information eg  traffic reports that can be disseminated to users based on their proximity to specified cellular phone towers 
where applicable  information can be disseminated to users as a ringtone  obviating the need for users to interact with their mobile phones in any manner 
global traffic network  inc is a holding company and conducts no operations 
unless we indicate otherwise  the discussions below regarding our financial condition and results of operations present information on a consolidated basis which assumes that the share exchange had been completed prior to the periods discussed such that australia traffic network was a wholly owned subsidiary of ours throughout such periods 
in that regard  our consolidated balance sheet data reflect the share exchange and discussions regarding our financial information reflect such information on a consolidated basis giving effect to the share exchange 
balance sheet information for periods prior to the share exchange does not reflect the issuance of the share exchange notes 
in each case  all material inter company transactions and balances have been eliminated 
financial information prior to may  the date of our formation pertains solely to australia traffic network 
the services we provide radio traffic reports  radio news reports and tv reports 
the information reports we provide to radio and television stations are divided into three categories based on the content of the report and the medium in which it is delivered 
collectively  we refer to these reports as our information reports 
radio traffic reports through our information gathering infrastructure and the use of external traffic information services  we provide daily scheduled customized traffic reports to radio stations that contract to receive our services 
radio news reports in july  we began building upon our radio traffic reports platform by obtaining and selling advertising inventory embedded within radio news reports 
tv reports in  we began providing regularly scheduled video traffic reports to television stations 
in addition  because our aircraft are often already in the air covering traffic conditions  they are often first to arrive at the scene of a breaking news story 
in a strategic effort to expand our reach into the television markets  we have been using this on the scene presence to compile video footage of such breaking news  which we provide to certain television stations that contract for our regularly scheduled tv reports in those markets where we produce video 

table of contents the radio stations that contract to provide us with traffic and news report advertising inventory become members of our radio network 
likewise  the television stations that contract to receive our tv reports become members of our tv network 
collectively  we refer to the members of these networks as our network affiliates 
we currently offer radio traffic and television traffic reports and video footage to our network affiliates in australia  while obtaining radio news report advertising inventory by paying cash compensation to our news network affiliates 
prior to our april purchase of wise broadcasting network inc  we provided only traffic and tv reports to our network affiliates in canada 
upon acquiring wise broadcasting network  we commenced providing news  weather  sports and business information reports to radio stations on a limited basis 
this information is primarily generated from outside sources 
as part of this acquisition  we also started providing content and selling advertising for various digital signage outlets  but we do not expect this to be a material part of our future business 
separately  we provide tv reports to five television stations in five of our canadian markets 
we intend to begin providing tv reports to network affiliates in our remaining canadian markets as our canadian operations expand and opportunities present themselves 
our sources of revenue sale of commercial airtime inventory in exchange for providing our information reports and or  for certain broadcasters  cash compensation  our network affiliates provide us with commercial advertising inventory primarily comprised of ten second advertising spots embedded in information reports 
we generate revenues by packaging and selling this commercial advertising inventory for cash to advertisers on a local  regional or national network basis 
to date  we have recognized no revenue related to the bartering of goods and services and do not anticipate entering into barter transactions for the sale of our commercial advertising inventory in the future 
the substantial majority of our revenues have been generated from our australian operations  including approximately million  or  of our revenues for year ended june  of such amount  approximately million  or  has been generated from the sale of commercial advertising inventory related to our australian radio traffic reports 
for the year ended june   approximately million  or of our revenues  was generated by our australian operations and approximately million  or  was generated from the sale of commercial advertising inventory related to our australian radio traffic reports 
we expect to accumulate increasing amounts of commercial advertising inventory from our australian operations as we continue to expand the provision of tv reports and obtain more news report inventory in australia 
we began accumulating commercial advertising inventory from our canadian operations in december and began generating limited revenue in canada in january currently  we have operations in seven canadian cities calgary  toronto  hamilton  vancouver  montreal  edmonton and winnipeg 
as commercial advertising inventory generated from our new canadian operations and our expanded australian operations increases  we expect to sell the increased commercial advertising inventory in the same manner as we have sold commercial advertising inventory generated from our provision of radio traffic reports in australia 
our experience indicates  however  that there is generally a delay between acquiring commercial advertising inventory from new or expanded operations and the realization of increasing revenue from the sale of such inventory 
we experienced such a delay when we added austereo as a network affiliate of our radio network in fiscal year although the additional commercial advertising inventory we acquired from austereo led to increased revenues during fiscal year  the full impact on revenues from the sale of such inventory was not realized until fiscal year we also experienced a similar lag when we began to receive news report inventory from austereo in july we expect to experience similar delays in realizing revenues from the sale of commercial advertising inventory associated with additional radio news reports in australia and our provision of radio traffic and information reports and tv reports in canada 
our expenses our expenses are primarily comprised of three categories operating expenses  selling expenses and general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses consist of station compensation and all expenses related to the gathering  producing  and broadcasting of our information reports  including aviation costs and expenses  salaries and benefits for our on air personalities who deliver the information reports 
station compensation consists of the reimbursement of expenses incurred by stations which we would otherwise incur in providing services to the station  as well as any additional cash consideration paid to a network affiliate in exchange for commercial advertising inventory 
we may incur increased expenses in the form of station compensation in connection with adding certain broadcasters to our base of network affiliates 
as mentioned above  our experience indicates that in such instances there is generally a delay between acquiring commercial advertising inventory from new network affiliates and the realization of increased revenue from the sale of such inventory 
aviation costs relate to the costs of our airborne surveillance  an integral part of our information gathering  and consist both of payments to outside vendors to lease aircraft and the operating costs including fuel  maintenance  and insurance costs associated with the operation of the fleet of aircraft we own 
our fleet of leased and owned aircraft currently consists of australia canada united kingdom leased owned leased owned leased owned fixed wing aircraft helicopters as our canadian operations expand  we may purchase two additional helicopters to replace our two leased helicopters in canada 
until we are able to purchase the number of helicopters necessary to support our operations  we intend to continue to lease such helicopters 
as of june   we had made  deposit on an additional helicopter for our canadian operations  which we paid for in july the total purchase price was approximately million 

table of contents selling expenses include salaries and benefits for our sales personnel and commissions paid on sales of our commercial advertising inventory 
general and administrative expenses consist of corporate overhead  including administrative salaries  real property lease payments  insurance  salaries and benefits for our corporate executive officers  compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock and legal and accounting fees 
expenses other than selling expenses are generally accounted for evenly over the applicable fiscal year 
basis of presentation we derive substantially all of our income and  the majority of our revenue from our australian operations  significant revenue and expenses from our canadian operations and we have recently begun generating expenses related to our start up operations in the united kingdom 
however  the financial information contained in this form k  including the financial statements  report our financial condition and results of operation in united states dollars and unless stated otherwise  all references to monetary amounts refer to united states dollars 
income statement amounts are converted from australian dollars  canadian dollars or british pounds to united states dollars based on the average exchange rate for each quarterly period covered 
assets and liabilities are converted based on the exchange rate as of the applicable balance sheet date 
equity is converted based on the exchange rate in place at the time of the applicable investment 
foreign currency translation adjustments occur when the income statement and balance sheet are converted at different exchange rates and are recognized as other comprehensive income or loss in the financial statements 
for reference  the exchange rates from australian dollars  canadian dollars and british pounds to united states dollars applicable to our income statement data for each of the three month periods ended june    and  march   and  december   and and september   and and applicable to our balance sheet data as of june  and are set forth below australia exchange balance income statement period rate sheet date exchange rate three month period ended june  june  three month period ended march  three month period ended december  three month period ended september  three month period ended june  june  three month period ended march  three month period ended december  three month period ended september  three month period ended june  three month period ended march  three month period ended december  three month period ended september  canada exchange balance income statement period rate sheet date exchange rate three month period ended june  june  three month period ended march  three month period ended december  three month period ended september  three month period ended june  june  three month period ended march  three month period ended december  three month period ended september  three month period ended june  three month period ended march  three month period ended december  three month period ended september  
table of contents united kingdom exchange balance income statement period rate sheet date exchange rate three month period ended june  june  three month period ended march  three month period ended december  three month period ended september  three month period ended june  june  three month period ended march  three month period ended december  as reflected above  the us dollar has weakened significantly compared to the australian dollar and the canadian dollar since the year ended june  this weakening of the us dollar causes both the australian and canadian revenue and expenses to be higher than they otherwise would be if the exchange rates were consistent for both periods 
our united kingdom operations are not included in the table since we did not generate revenue in either year and our united kingdom operations did not commence until the second fiscal quarter of the year ended june  we estimate that the impact from the currency changes in australia and canada on our operating results for year ended june  compared to the year ended june  has been to increase income statement amounts as follows year ended june  in thousands australia net revenue operating expense sales  general administrative expense canada net revenue operating expense sales  general administrative expense canada australia combined net revenue operating expense sales  general administrative expense when discussing changes in income statement accounts from the years ended june  and  the analysis under results of operations below includes both the impact of currency changes and changes in revenues and expenditures in the local currency 
seasonality of business we believe that advertising revenues in general vary moderately over the calendar year  with the three month period ending december generally resulting in the highest revenues and the three month period ending march generally resulting in the lowest revenues 
this industry trend is mainly attributable to increases in the level of advertiser demand  and resulting increases in average advertising spot rates and or number of spots sold  during the months leading up to the christmas holiday season and lower advertiser demand following the end of the holiday season which leads to lower average advertising spot rates and or number of spots sold during that time 
we believe that this general trend in advertising revenues is applicable to our business 
over the past five fiscal years  however  the impact of seasonality has been offset by the rapid revenue growth  and in certain cases  favorable exchange rate movements  as revenues for the quarter ending march have exceeded revenues for the quarter ended september during these fiscal years 
in addition  over the past three fiscal years our revenue in the quarter ending june has exceeded the quarter ended december  also due to our rapid revenue growth 
our expenses other than sales costs are generally spread evenly over the fiscal year 
as a result  we generally experience seasonality in the amount of our net income absent growth due to the addition of new network affiliates 

table of contents results of operations year ended june  compared with year ended june  during the year ended june   we began providing service to our first radio traffic network affiliates in the united kingdom and our results include a full year of expense related to uk traffic network  which was formed in september we also began to incur costs for mobile traffic network  which was formed in march neither uk traffic network nor mobile traffic network generated any revenue for the year ended june  effective july   uk traffic network began providing service to the united kingdom highways agency under the traffic radio contract  which should significantly increase both revenue and expense in the united kingdom during the fiscal year ending june  should we complete an acquisition of ubc media group plc s commercial division as currently contemplated  revenues and expense related to fiscal united kingdom operations should experience further significant increases 
revenue 
revenue increased from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june   an increase of approximately

additionally  revenues from the sale of inventory related to our canadian operations increased approximately million  an increase of approximately 
the increase in our australian revenues consisted of approximately million from our radio network and approximately million from our tv network 
the increase in revenues from our radio network was approximately million from our traffic network and approximately million from our news network 
the most significant portion of the revenue increase in both australia and canada was the result of selling more advertising spots than during the previous period  followed by the favorable currency fluctuation discussed above see tables below for results in local currency 
we generated no revenue from our united kingdom operations or our mobile traffic network operations during the years ended june  and operating expenses 
operating expenses increased from approximately million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june   an increase of approximately 
approximately million of the increase pertained to our australian operations  approximately million pertained to our canadian operations  and approximately million of the increase pertained to our united kingdom operations 
of the increase pertaining to our australian operations  approximately million related to traffic  approximately million related to news and approximately million related to television 
the australian traffic increase consisted of increased station compensation of approximately million and increased employee costs of approximately million 
the increase in news costs in australia was primarily due to a million increase in station compensation offset by a decrease in employee costs of million 
the decrease in employee costs resulted from the resignation of our news director whose position was not replaced 
the increase in australia tv expenses was primarily due to higher station compensation 
higher operating expenses in canada consisted primarily of increases of approximately million in employee costs  million in station compensation  million in aviation costs  million in communications costs and million in facilities rent 
higher expenses in the united kingdom primarily resulted from our operating for the entire year ended june   and our incurring additional expenses in providing service and station compensation to our initial eleven radio traffic network affiliates  all or which commenced service during fiscal due mainly to providing service under the traffic radio contract with the highways agency and to a lesser extent providing service to our radio traffic network affiliates for the entire year  our operating expenses in the united kingdom will be significantly higher for the duration of the traffic radio contract 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june   an increase of approximately

selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million in australia due to higher sales personnel costs of approximately million primarily associated with increased sales during the year  million due to higher administrative personnel costs and approximately million due to increased travel costs  both of which were primarily related to the expansion of our information technology department  and million increase each in both office rent and legal and professional fees 
selling  general and administrative costs increased approximately million due to start up costs for mobile traffic network 
the change in the overhead allocation which eliminates in consolidation from the year ended june  was an increase of approximately million for global traffic network and a reduction of million for australia traffic network 
sales expense as a percentage of revenue in australia increased from approximately for the year ended june  to approximately for the year ended june  depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  the increase is mainly due to our acquisition of additional helicopters throughout the year ended june   as well as helicopters placed in service during the year ended june  that were not depreciated for the entire year 
we have taken delivery of an additional helicopter for use in our canadian operations and may purchase an additional helicopter for use in our canadian operations 
consequently we expect that depreciation and amortization expense will continue to increase accordingly in future periods 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million of the year ended june  this decrease was primarily due to our repayment of the canadian traffic network shareholder note during the year ended june  and lower debt outstanding for australia traffic network during the current fiscal year 
other income 
other income increased from approximately million for the year ended june  to approximately million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to interest income on the unused proceeds from our follow on offering which closed on july  currently interest rates are lower than they had been during the year ended june  should lower interest rates continue to prevail  we expect that our interest income will be lower in the foreseeable future 
in addition  we anticipate using approximately million to the fund our contemplated acquisition of ubc media group plc s commercial division 
if and when we consummate this acquisition  our investable cash balances will be significantly lower  which will also lower future interest income

table of contents income taxes 
prior to the consummation of the share exchange  australia traffic network operated as an australian corporation and paid federal income taxes in australia 
the united states shareholders of australia traffic network recorded their share of australia traffic network s income on their personal income tax returns and received deduction on their united states federal income tax returns for the australian taxes paid 
because australian income taxes are generally lower than united states income taxes  a tax liability was passed on to each united states shareholder 
australia traffic network s then existing shareholders became liable for the tax triggered by the share exchange 
prior to the effective time of the initial public offering  we issued the share exchange notes  in an aggregate amount of million  to the australia traffic network shareholders 
the share exchange notes were intended to cover the estimated tax consequences to such shareholders of the share exchange 
upon the closing of the initial public offering  we repaid the share exchange notes in full 
we operate as a united states corporation with wholly owned direct and indirect operating subsidiaries in australia  canada and united kingdom 
we will pay income taxes in those countries as well as in the united states 
the current federal statutory tax rate is in australia while the estimated effective combined federal and provincial tax rate is approximately in canada  the estimated effective corporate tax rate in the united kingdom is approximately and the estimated federal and state tax rate in the united states is approximately 
contractual commitments the table below sets forth our contractual obligations as of june  payments due by period less more than than contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands long term debt obligations interest on long term debt obligations operating lease obligations station obligations total critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate these estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be those most important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial condition revenue recognition 
revenues are earned and recognized at the time commercial advertisements are broadcast 
payments received in advance or amounts invoiced in advance are deferred until earned and such payments and amounts are included as a component of deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
all revenues pertain to cash sales 
we determine that commercial advertisements are broadcast based on the announcers written verification on the broadcast log or written verification from our network affiliates for advertisements they broadcast 
the broadcast log is a schedule of station  time and advertiser for each report that an announcer broadcasts 
the broadcast logs are generated by our scheduling department through our automated scheduling system  based on advertising sales orders and our network affiliate stations scheduled report times 
revenues are reported net of commissions given to third party advertising agencies that represent a majority of our advertisers 
cash and cash equivalents 
we consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of less than three months to be cash equivalents 
the carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short maturity of these instruments 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are recorded at the invoice amount and are not interest bearing 
we perform credit evaluations of our new advertisers and generally require no collateral 
we provide for losses from uncollectible accounts based on analyzing historical data and current trends 
such losses have historically been minimal in relation to revenues 
past due amounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when collection is deemed unlikely and all collection efforts have ceased 
management has established an allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately   and  as of june   and  respectively 

table of contents income taxes 
we have adopted the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under the asset and liability method of sfas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to net operating loss carry forwards and to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
under sfas  the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets or liabilities is recognized in the statement of income in the period that included the enactment 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets unless their realization is considered more likely than not 
currently  of the us  united kingdom and canadian tax loss carry forwards generated by us are allowed for since it is unclear whether we will ever have us income  to utilize the tax loss carry forwards and foreign tax credits and it is not yet reasonably certain that our operations in canada or the united kingdom will be profitable in the future to utilize these tax loss carry forwards 
undistributed earnings of the our foreign subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested so no provision for united states federal or state taxes has been made 
upon repatriation of these earnings  via dividends or otherwise  we would be subject to united states federal and state income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits 
we may also be subject to withholding taxes on any distribution in the foreign countries 
the determination of the amount of the unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a common definition for fair value to be applied to us gaap guidance requiring use of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure about such fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company adopted sfas on july  the company is currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas  but does not expect that it will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas allows for the one time election to measure financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas also amends sfas no 
with regards to the presentation of available for sale and trading securities 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company adopted sfas on july  the company is currently assessing the impact of adopting sfas  but does not expect that it will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  to create greater consistency in the accounting and financial reporting of business combinations 
sfas r requires a company to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquired entity to be measured at their fair values as of the acquisition date 
sfas r also requires companies to recognize and measure goodwill acquired in a business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and how to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r applies to fiscal years beginning after december  and is adopted prospectively 
earlier adoption is prohibited 
the company expects to adopt sfas r on july  and does not expect the provisions of sfas r to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
if the company s acquisition of the commercial division of ubc media group plc closes prior to adoption of sfas r  there will be a difference in the accounting treatment of the transaction than there would be if sfas r had already been adopted 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk we are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates 
our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents and long term debt 
we consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with a maturity of less than three months to be cash equivalents 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
however  due to the large cash and cash equivalents balances  a one percent decrease in the interest rates we earn on these balances would reduce interest income approximately million on an annual basis based on the balances at june  we have no derivative financial instruments or auction rate securities in our cash and cash equivalents 
our total outstanding long term debt at june  was approximately million 
of the outstanding long term debt  only approximately  was subject to a variable interest rate while the remainder was subject to a fixed interest rate 
in addition  we had an unutilized bank overdraft line of credit of approximately million that bears interest at a variable rate 
we do not see the variable interest rate long term debt as a significant interest rate risk because our entire outstanding balance of variable interest rate debt was repaid july  and we have no current plans to borrow money under the bank overdraft line of credit 
foreign currency exchange risk we have significant foreign subsidiaries located in australia  canada and the united kingdom 
the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are denominated in australian dollars  canadian dollars and british pounds  respectively  and as such are translated into united states dollars 
income statement amounts are translated from australian dollars  canadian dollars  or british pounds to united states dollars based on the average exchange rate for each quarterly period covered 
assets and liabilities are converted based on the exchange rate as of the applicable balance sheet date 
foreign currency translation adjustments occur when the income statement and balance sheet are converted at different exchange rates and are recognized as other comprehensive income or loss in the financial statements 
we do not currently hedge for currency fluctuations with our foreign subsidiaries 

table of contents accounts receivable the company s receivables do not represent a significant concentration of credit risk due to the large number of customers and the fact that no one customer represents more than of our annual revenue 
however  one advertising agency that represents a number of our clients constituted approximately of our revenues for the year ended june  and approximately of our net accounts receivable as of june  off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements
