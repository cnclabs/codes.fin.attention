chordiant undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement to reflect events after the date of this report 
executive overview as an enterprise software vendor  we generate substantially all of our revenues from insurance  healthcare  telecommunications  financial services and retail markets 
our customers typically fund purchases of our software and services out of their lines of business and information technology budgets 
as a result  our revenues are heavily influenced by our customers long term business outlook and willingness to invest in new enterprise information systems and business applications 
our business has been adversely impacted by the recent worldwide credit market turmoil  the result of which is that customers are hesitant to make large commitments and some customers are merging 
the company s operations and performance depend on our customers having adequate resources to purchase our products and services 
the unprecedented turmoil in the credit markets and the global economic downturn generally will adversely impact our customers and potential customers 
these economic conditions have continued to deteriorate despite government intervention globally  and may remain volatile and uncertain for the foreseeable future 
customers may alter their purchasing activities in response to lack of credit  economic uncertainty and concern about the stability of markets in general  and these customers may reduce  delay or terminate purchases of our products and services or other sales activities that affect purchases of our products and services 
if we are unable to adequately respond to changes in demand resulting from deteriorating economic conditions  our financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
several of the company s current and prior customers have recently merged with others  been forced to raise significant levels of new capital  or received funds and or equity infusions from regulators or governmental entities 
this list of companies is extensive and includes wachovia corporation  aig  halifax bank of scotland  royal bank of scotland  barclays  and lloyds 
the impact of these mergers and changes in ownership on chordiant s near term business is uncertain 
customers who have recently reorganized  merged or face new regulations may delay or terminated their software purchasing decisions  and as an acquired or merged entity may lose the ability to make such purchasing decisions  resulting in declines in our bookings  revenues and cash flows 
for the fiscal year ended september   we recorded revenue of million 
we generated million of net income and ended the fiscal year with over million in cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities as compared to million for fiscal year ended september  in addition  we repurchased million of our common stock during the year 
total revenue for the fiscal year ended september  decreased to million from million of the prior year 
the decrease in revenue was primarily from license revenue  decreasing million as the company had fewer license transactions 
service revenue increased million from prior year 
the increase in service revenue was primarily composed of an increase of million associated with support and maintenance revenue  million from consulting revenue  million in training revenue and million in expense reimbursement revenue 

table of contents software industry consolidation and possible increased competition the enterprise software industry continues to undergo consolidation in sectors of the software industry in which we operate 
in and ibm acquired ilog  cognos  datamirror and watchfire corporation  oracle completed its acquisitions of hyperion  moniforce and bea systems  sun microsystems acquired mysql and sap acquired businessobjects  yasu technologies and pilot software 
while we do not believe that ilog  cognos  datamirror  watchfire corporation  hyperion  moniforce  bea systems  mysql  businessobjects  yasu technologies  or pilot software have been significant competitors of chordiant in the past  the acquisition of these companies by ibm  oracle  sun microsystems and sap may indicate that we may face increased competition from larger and more established entities in the future 
financial trends backlog 
our revenues have primarily been derived from large customer transactions 
for some of these transactions  the associated professional services provided to the customer can span over a period greater than one year 
if the services delivery period is over a prolonged period of time  it will cause the associated backlog to be recognized as revenue over a similar period of time 
as of september  and  we had approximately million and million in backlog  respectively  which we define as contractual commitments by our customers through purchase orders or contracts 
this decrease in backlog is partially reflected in the decrease of deferred revenue recorded on our balance sheet 
for the period ended september  to september  deferred revenue decreased million due to a decrease of million in short term deferred revenue and a million decrease in long term deferred revenue 
backlog is comprised of software license orders for which the delivered products have not been accepted by customers or have not otherwise met all of the required criteria for revenue recognition 
this component includes billed amounts classified as deferred revenue  contractual commitments received from customers through purchase orders or contracts that have yet to be delivered  deferred revenue from customer support contracts  and consulting service orders representing the unbilled remaining balances of consulting contracts not yet completed or delivered  plus deferred consulting revenue where we have not otherwise met all of the required criteria for revenue recognition 
consulting service orders that have expired are excluded from backlog 
backlog is not necessarily indicative of revenues to be recognized in a specified future period 
there are many factors that could impact chordiant s conversion of backlog as recognizable revenue  such as chordiant s progress in completing projects for its customers  chordiant s customers meeting anticipated schedules for customer dependent deliverables and customers increasing the scope or duration of a contract causing license revenue to be deferred for a longer period of time 
chordiant provides no assurances that any portion of its backlog will be recognized as revenue during any fiscal year or at all  or that its backlog will be recognized as revenues in any given period 
in addition  it is possible that customers from whom we expect to derive revenue from backlog will default  and as a result  we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog 
for the fiscal year ended september   we entered into several large customer orders resulting in a significant portion of our near term license revenues being recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting such that our deferred revenue balance increased 
a portion of these orders continue to require consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the respective licenses 
implementation by third parties 
over time  as our products mature and system integrators become more familiar with our products  our involvement with implementations has diminished on some projects 
if this trend continues to evolve  certain agreements with customers may transition from a contract accounting model to a more traditional revenue model whereby revenues are recorded upon delivery 
service revenues 
service revenues as a percentage of total revenues were   and for the years ended september    and  respectively 
we expect that service revenues will represent between and of our total revenues in the foreseeable future 

table of contents revenues from international customers versus north america 
for all periods presented  revenues were principally derived from customer accounts in north america and europe 
for the fiscal years ended september    and  international revenues were million  million  and million or approximately  and of our total revenues  respectively 
we believe international revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in future periods 
the significant increase in international revenue for year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  was due to an improved economy for the region as well as an improved sales production for the region resulting from the new management team that was put in place during fiscal year international revenues were favorably impacted for the year ended september   as compared to the year ended september   as both the british pound and the euro increased in average value by approximately and  respectively  as compared to the us dollar 
in future periods  the company plans to pursue revenue opportunities in several emerging markets including eastern europe  russia  china  and india 
we believe international revenues will represent a larger portion of our total revenues as we expand into emerging markets 
for the fiscal years ended september    and  north america revenues were million  million  and million or approximately   and of our total revenues  respectively 
we believe north america revenues will continue to represent to of our total revenues in the future 
gross margins 
management focuses on license and service gross margins in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance 
gross margins on license revenues were   and for the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively 
we expect license gross margin on current products to range from to in the foreseeable future 
the margin will fluctuate with the mix of products sold 
historically  the enterprise solution products have higher associated third party royalty expense than the marketing solution products and decision management products 
gross margins on service revenues were   and for the fiscal years ended september    and  respectively 
the increase in gross margins for the year ended september  is primarily due to improved consulting services utilization rates and increased support and maintenance revenue 
we expect that gross margins on service revenue to range between and in the foreseeable future 
costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of in addition to audit fees  significant professional service expenses are included in general and administrative costs relating to efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of for the fiscal years ended september    and  these costs were million  million  and million  respectively 
while these costs are expected to continue into the next fiscal year  the decline in amount and timing of the costs through fiscal year is uncertain as compared to the costs incurred for the year ended september  costs related to stock option investigation 
for the fiscal years ended september  and  significant outside professional services are included in general and administrative expense associated with the company s stock option investigation which began in july and was completed during the quarter ended march  this issue is more fully described in the in note  restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements in notes to consolidated financial statements of the annual report on form k for the year ended september  for the year ended september  and  these costs were and million  respectively 
we have not incurred any additional costs since the quarter ended march  and do not expect to incur such costs in future periods 
cost to amend eligible options 
in july  our board of directors  or the board  initiated a review of our historical stock option grant practices and appointed the audit committee to oversee the investigation 
the audit committee determined that the correct measurement dates for a number of stock option grants made by us during the period to  or review period  differed from the measurement dates previously used to account for such option grants 
the audit committee identified errors related to the determination of the measurement dates for grants of options where the price of our common stock on the selected grant date was lower than the price on the actual grant date which would permit recipients to exercise these options at a lower exercise price 
as such  these affected stock options are deemed  for accounting purposes  to have been granted at a discount 
based on the determination made for accounting purposes  the discounted options for accounting purposes may now be deemed to have been granted at a discount for tax purposes  which may expose the holders of these impacted stock option grants to potentially adverse tax treatment under section a of the internal revenue code and state law equivalents 
as more fully described on form sc to i filed with the sec on march   chordiant offered certain optionees the opportunity to increase the exercise price of the discounted options to limit the potential adverse personal tax consequences that may apply to those stock options under section a of the internal revenue code and state law equivalents 
on april   eligible optionees finalized their elections under the offer and were awarded a cash payment equal to the price differential of the amended options 
these payments were treated as bonus payments 
these cash payments were approximately million and were paid out in january 
table of contents reductions in workforce 
subsequent to our fiscal year ended september   the company initiated a restructuring plan  the restructuring  intended to align its resources and cost structure with expected future revenues 
the restructuring plan included reductions in headcount and third party consultants across all functional areas in both north america and europe 
the restructuring plan included a reduction of approximately of the company s permanent workforce 
a significant portion of the positions eliminated were in north america 
as a result of the cost cutting measures  the company estimates that it will record pre tax cash restructuring charges in the first quarter of fiscal year  of approximately to million  including to million for severance costs and approximately million for other contract termination costs 
the company anticipates that all of the aggregate charges will result in cash expenditures  the majority of which are to be paid in the first quarter of fiscal year on may   chordiant implemented a reduction of approximately of its workforce 
the company reduced its headcount across all functions of the organization 
chordiant plans to reallocate resources in support of growth opportunities in emerging markets as well as adding headcount in revenue generating areas such as sales and alliances 
chordiant incurred approximately million in expenses in the third quarter of fiscal year in connection with this reduction of force 
as these costs did not meet the criteria of sfas to qualify as restructuring expenses  the expenses were charged as operating expenses to the respective functional areas 
in october  the company initiated a restructuring plan intended to align its resources and cost structure with expected future revenues 
the restructuring plan included a balancing of services resources worldwide  an elimination of duplicative functions internationally  and a shift in the us field organization toward a focus on domain based sales and pre sales teams 
the restructuring plan included an immediate reduction in positions of slightly more than of the company s workforce  consolidation of our european facilities  and the closure of our france office 
a majority of the positions eliminated were in europe 
the plan was committed to on october   and we began notifying employees on october  we recorded a pre tax cash restructuring expense of million as calculated using the net present value of the related costs as required by sfas the expense was composed of costs for severance and exiting excess facilities 
during the three months ended march   we incurred an additional charge of million for employee severance costs associated with the closure of our france office 
also during the three months ended march   we negotiated an early termination of the france office lease associated with its closure  resulting in a million reduction in the excess facility liability 
this reduction was recorded as an offset to restructuring expense in the period 
in quarter ended december   we negotiated a break clause in the lease allowing for an early termination of the united kingdom facility which released us from any future rent liabilities subsequent to january all termination payments have now been made 
in july  we undertook an approximate reduction in our workforce 
in connection with this action  we incurred a one time cash expense of approximately million in the fourth quarter ended september  for severance benefits 
during the three months ended march   the company incurred an additional charge of less than million for additional severance expense for an employee located in france 
during fiscal year  we restructured several areas of the company to reduce expenses and improve revenues 
as part of this restructuring  we closed an office facility in boston  massachusetts and recorded an expense associated with the long term lease which expires in january during the three months ended march   we completed a new sublease with a sub lessee for the remaining term of our lease at a rate lower than that which was forecasted when the original restructuring expense was recorded in this change in estimate resulted in a million restructuring expense for the fiscal year ended september  past results may not be indicative of future performance 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
our prospects must be considered given the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving businesses 
there can be no assurance we will be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
moreover  we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or gaap in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 

table of contents on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of stock based compensation  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  valuation of deferred tax assets  restructuring expenses  contingencies  vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value in multiple element arrangements and the estimates associated with the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain of our revenue contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  including estimating the total estimated time required to complete sales arrangements involving significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts  and assessment of the probability of the outcome of our current litigation  stock based compensation expense  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  restructuring expenses  and determining functional currencies for the purposes of consolidating our international operations 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from licenses of our software and related services  which include assistance in implementation  customization and integration  post contract customer support services or pcs  training and consulting 
the amount and timing of our revenue is difficult to predict and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to period to period and could result in operating losses 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretation of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition accounting rules require management to make significant estimates based on judgment 
software license revenue is recognized in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountant s or aicpa s statement of position no 
software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position no 
software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements  or collectively sop for arrangements with multiple elements  we recognize revenue for services and pcs based upon the fair value vsoe of the respective elements 
the fair value vsoe of the services element is based upon the standard hourly rates we charge for the services when such services are sold separately 
the fair value vsoe for annual pcs is generally established with the contractual future renewal rates included in the contracts  when the renewal rate is substantive and consistent with the fees when support services are sold separately 
when contracts contain multiple elements and fair value vsoe exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements  principally the license portion  based upon the residual method as prescribed by sop in multiple element transactions where vsoe is not established for an undelivered element  we recognize revenue upon the establishment of vsoe for that element or when the element is delivered 
at the time we enter into a transaction  we assess whether any services included within the arrangement related to significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products 
for contracts for products that do not involve significant implementation or customization that is essential to the product functionality  we recognize license revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable and delivery has occurred as prescribed by sop for contracts that involve significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products  we recognize the license and professional consulting services revenue using either the percentage of completion method or the completed contract method as prescribed by statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain product type contracts  or sop 
table of contents the percentage of completion method is applied when we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the total effort required for completion using labor hours incurred as the measure of progress towards completion 
the progress toward completion is measured based on the go live date 
we define the go live date as the date the essential product functionality has been delivered or the application enters into a production environment or the point at which no significant additional chordiant supplied professional service resources are required 
estimates are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
we account for the changes as changes in accounting estimates when the information becomes known 
information impacting estimates obtained after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of the financial statements is used to update the estimates 
provisions for estimated contract losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
when we sell additional licenses related to the original licensing agreement  revenue is recognized upon delivery if the project has reached the go live date  or if the project has not reached the go live date  revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
we classify revenues from these arrangements as license and service revenue based upon the estimated fair value of each element using the residual method 
the completed contract method is applied when we are unable to obtain reasonably dependable estimates of the total effort required for completion 
under the completed contract method  all revenue and related costs of revenue are deferred and recognized upon completion 
for product co development arrangements relating to software products in development prior to the consummation of the individual arrangements where we retain the intellectual property being developed and intend to sell the resulting products to other customers  license revenue is deferred until the delivery of the final product  provided all other requirements of sop are met 
expenses associated with these co development arrangements are accounted for under sfas and are normally expensed as incurred as they are considered to be research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalization or deferral 
revenue from subscription or term license agreements  which include software and rights to unspecified future products or maintenance  is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period 
revenue from subscription or term license agreements  which include software  but exclude rights to unspecified future products and maintenance  is recognized upon delivery of the software if all conditions of recognizing revenue have been met including that the related agreement is non cancelable  non refundable and provided on an unsupported basis 
for transactions involving extended payment terms  we deem these fees not to be fixed or determinable for revenue recognition purposes and revenue is deferred until the fees become payable and due 
for arrangements with multiple elements accounted for under sop where we determine we can account for the elements separately and the fees are not fixed or determinable due to extended payment terms  revenue is recognized in the following manner 
if the undelivered element is pcs  or other services  an amount equal to the estimated value of the services to be rendered prior to the next payment becoming due is allocated to the undelivered services 
the residual of the payment is allocated to the delivered elements of the arrangement 
for arrangements with multiple elements accounted for under sop where we determine we can account for the elements separately and the fees are not fixed or determinable due to extended payment terms  revenue is recognized in the following manner 
amounts are first allocated to the undelivered elements included in the arrangement  as payments become due or are received  the residual is allocated to the delivered elements 
we recognize revenue for pcs ratably over the support period which typically ranges from one to five years 
our training and consulting services revenues are recognized as such services are performed on an hourly or daily basis for time and material contracts 
for consulting services arrangements with a fixed fee  we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion method 
for all sales we use either a signed license agreement or a binding purchase order where we have a master license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our third party systems integrators are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders or order forms on a transaction by transaction basis 
revenues from reseller arrangements are recognized on the sell through method  when the reseller reports to us the sale of our software products to end users 
our agreements with customers and resellers do not contain product return rights 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that the collection of a fee is not probable  we recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
generally  we require no collateral from our customers 
our gross accounts receivable balance was million with an allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of september  our gross accounts receivable balance was million including long term accounts receivable of million with an allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of september  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
based upon current economic conditions  the company has reviewed accounts receivable and has recorded allowances as deemed necessary 
stock based compensation expense 
upon adoption of sfas r on october   we began estimating the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes model 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the value of each employee stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes model for the purpose of the pro forma financial disclosure in accordance with sfas the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
with the adoption of sfas r on october   we used the trinomial lattice valuation technique to determine the assumptions used in the black scholes model 
the trinomial lattice valuation technique was used to provide better estimates of fair values and meet the fair value objectives of sfas r 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
the estimated value of a stock option is most sensitive to the volatility assumption 
based on the september  variables  it is estimated that a change of in either the volatility  expected life or interest rate assumption would result in a corresponding  or change in the estimated value of the option being valued using the black scholes model 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding stock based compensation expense 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
at september   we have million in gross deferred tax assets dtas attributable principally to our net operating losses nols 
historically  we have maintained a valuation allowance on our dtas because we have previously been unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize the tax benefits of these dtas 
based on recent operating results and the reorganization of our intellectual property into the us  our current projections of disaggregated future taxable income have enabled us to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will have future taxable income sufficient to realize million of tax benefits from our deferred tax assets  which consist of that portion of our net deferred tax assets attributable to our net operating losses nols residing in the united kingdom 
accordingly  we have released eliminated million of the valuation allowance on our dtas  of which million is recognized as an offsetting reduction to goodwill representing pre acquisition nols and million is recognized as a credit reduction to the provision for income taxes 
in future periods  we expect to incur tax expense related to the united kingdom which will result in an increase in overall expense  however  to the extent that such tax expense is offset by the utilization of nols  the recognition of this additional tax expense will be a non cash item 

table of contents the remaining balance of gross deferred tax assets was generated in the us with respect to our us generated deferred tax assets  we have recorded a full valuation allowance as the future realization of the tax benefit is not considered by management to be more likely than not 
our estimate of future taxable income considers available positive and negative evidence regarding our current and future operations  including projections of income in various states and foreign jurisdictions 
we believe our estimate of future taxable income is reasonable  however  it is inherently uncertain  and if our future operations generate taxable income greater than projected  further adjustments to reduce the valuation allowance are possible 
conversely  if we realize unforeseen material losses in the future  or our ability to generate future taxable income necessary to realize a portion of the net deferred tax asset is materially reduced  additions to the valuation allowance could be recorded 
at september   the balance of the deferred tax valuation allowance was approximately million 
effective october   the company adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation  no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
or fin fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement guidance for the financial statement reporting of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a company s income tax return 
the application of fin is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
furthermore  we assess the impairment of goodwill annually 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  market capitalization declines relative to net book value  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
when one or more of the above indicators of impairment occurs we estimate the value of long lived assets and intangible assets to determine whether there is impairment 
we measure any impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow method  which requires us to make several estimates including the estimated cash flows associated with the asset  the period over which these cash flows will be generated and a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
these estimates are subjective and if we made different estimates  it could materially impact the estimated fair value of these assets and the conclusions we reached regarding impairment 
to date  we have not identified any triggering events noted above 
while the recent decline in our stock price and negative economic trends have lowered our market capitalization at september   our market capitalization is still at the levels significantly higher than our book value 
we are required to perform an impairment review of our goodwill balance on at least an annual basis 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step we compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill  of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we proceed on to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step we perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to our identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this derives an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess 

table of contents we determined that we have one reporting unit 
we completed a goodwill impairment review for the period including september  and and performed step of the goodwill impairment analysis required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of september  and using the methodology described above 
accordingly  step was not performed 
we will continue to test for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount 
in the fiscal year ended september   we reduced goodwill by million 
the adjustment relates to a tax benefit attributable to our acquisition in the united kingdom 
the adjustment of goodwill is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring expenses 
in the past several years  we have implemented various cost reduction plans as part of our continued effort to streamline our operations to reduce ongoing operating expenses 
these plans resulted in restructuring expenses related to  among others  the consolidation of excess facilities 
these charges relate to facilities and portions of facilities we no longer utilize and either seek to terminate early or sublease 
lease termination costs and brokerage fees for the abandoned facilities were estimated for the remaining lease obligations and were offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with suitable sub lessees and sublease rates which can be achieved using market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage retained by us 
each reporting period we review these estimates and to the extent that these assumptions change due to new agreements with landlords  new subleases with tenants  or changes in the market  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary by material amounts 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding restructuring expenses 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation 
we have several foreign subsidiaries that together account for a significant portion of our revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under the relevant accounting guidance are either included within the consolidated statement of operations or as a separate part of the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management s judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary conducts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if any subsidiary s functional currency were deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements would be included in cumulative translation adjustments 
however  if the functional currency were deemed to be the united states dollar then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within our consolidated statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be recognized in our consolidated statement of operations 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our consolidated statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the relevant subsidiary s local currency to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries 
accordingly  foreign currency translation gains and loses are included as part of accumulated other comprehensive income within our consolidated balance sheet for all periods presented 
historically the settlement of long term intercompany balances has not been planned or anticipated 
as a result  accumulated foreign currency gains and losses associated with these intercompany balances have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheets 
while the company has no current intent to settle these long term accounts  circumstances could change at some point in the future 
for example  the transfer of cash balances currently held by international subsidiaries to the parent company in the us might be considered as a source of funds for potential merger and acquisition activity or additional share repurchase programs 
in the event that the entities were to plan to settle such long term intercompany balances  any associated accumulated foreign currency gain or loss would need to be reclassified to the consolidated statement of operations  resulting in a realized gain or loss 
the amount of the gain or loss would be dependent upon the exchange rates in effect when settlement was planned or anticipated 

table of contents the foreign currency gains or losses are dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar 
these currencies include the united kingdom pound sterling  the euro and the canadian dollar 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly different than those reported in previous periods 
at september   approximately million of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states

the increase or decrease of license revenue occurring within the three different product groups is dependent on the timing of when a sales transaction is completed and whether a license transaction was sold with essential consulting services 
licenses sold with essential consulting services are generally recognized as revenue under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the timing and amount of revenue for those transactions being recognized under the percentage of completion method is influenced by the progress of work performed relative to the project length of customer contracts and the dollar value of such contracts 
these orders typically involve consulting services that are essential to functionality of the respective licenses

the decrease in license revenue is the result of fewer sales transactions and transactions of smaller magnitude being executed in the current year 
in the quarter ended june   we recognized license revenue that was deferred in the previous quarters 
these revenues were deferred as they were related to an undelivered license element that was subsequently delivered in the june quarter 
service revenue 
service revenue is primarily composed of consulting implementation and integration  consulting customization  training  pcs  and certain reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
the increase or decrease of service revenue within the three different product emphases is primarily due to the timing of when license transactions are completed  whether or not the license was sold with essential consulting services  the sophistication of the customer s application  and the expertise of the customer s internal development team 
for non essential service transactions  service revenue will lag in timing compared to the period of when the license revenue is recognized

the changes in foreign exchange rates may also cause revenues related to prepaid contracts to be lower than ultimately recognized as revenue

during the three months ended march   the company incurred an additional charge of less than million for additional severance expense for an employee located in france 
during fiscal year  we restructured several areas of the company to reduce expenses and improve revenues 
as part of this restructuring  we closed an office facility in boston  massachusetts and recorded a charge associated with the long term lease which expires in january in the march quarter  we completed a new sublease with a sub lessee for the remaining term of our lease at a rate lower than that which was forecasted when the original restructure charge was recorded in this change in estimate resulted in a million charge to restructuring in the quarter ended march  stock based compensation included in individual operating expense and cost of revenue categories

the million decrease in income taxes is primarily due to the reduction of taxable income  the reversal of valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of million and a decrease of million in unrecoverable withholding tax payments related to sales transactions that occurred in turkey and poland compared to fiscal year the remainder of our provision is attributable to taxes on earnings from our foreign subsidiaries and certain us state income taxes 
at september   we have million in gross dtas attributable principally to our nols 
historically  we have maintained a valuation allowance on our dtas because we have previously been unable to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will realize the tax benefits of these dtas 
based on recent operating results and the reorganization of our intellectual property into the us  our current projections of disaggregated future taxable income have enabled us to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will have future taxable income sufficient to realize million of tax benefits from our deferred tax assets  which consist of that portion of our net deferred tax assets attributable to our nols residing in the united kingdom 
accordingly  we have released eliminated million of the valuation allowance on our dtas  of which million is recognized as an offsetting reduction to goodwill representing pre acquisition nols and million is recognized as a credit reduction to the provision for income taxes 
in future periods  we expect to incur tax expense related to the united kingdom which will result in an increase in overall expense  however  to the extent that such tax expense is offset by the utilization of nols  the recognition of this additional tax expense will be a non cash item 

table of contents the remaining balance of gross deferred tax assets was generated in the us with respect to our us generated deferred tax assets  we have recorded a full valuation allowance as the future realization of the tax benefit is not considered by management to be more likely than not 
at september   the balance of the deferred tax valuation allowance was approximately million

see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we believe that the effects of our strategic actions implemented to reduce costs in a period of declining revenues will be adequate to generate sufficient cash flows from operations  which  when combined with existing cash balances  we anticipate will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for the near term 
if the global economy weakens further  additional declines in cash balances could occur 
we anticipate that operating expenses will continue to be a material use of our cash resources 
we may continue to utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in other businesses  technologies or product lines or repurchase and retire additional shares of outstanding common stock 
in the long term  we may require additional funds to support our working capital and operating expense requirements or for other purposes  and may seek to raise these additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings 
there can be no assurance that this additional financing will be available  or if available  will be on reasonable terms 
failure to generate sufficient revenues or to control spending could adversely affect our ability to achieve our business objectives

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
the following table presents the amounts of restricted cash that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of september  in thousands september  fair value average interest rates restricted cash invested in short term investments total restricted cash and marketable securities the following table presents the amounts of restricted cash and marketable securities that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of september  in thousands september  fair value average interest rates restricted cash invested in short term investments marketable securities total restricted cash and marketable securities interest rate risk 
as of september   our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to money market accounts  and short term certificates of deposit 
we currently invest our excess cash in money market accounts and certificates of deposit with maturities of less than one year 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell our fixed rate securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of september   the company held no fixed rate securities 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s total restricted cash and marketable securities  the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the hypothetical impact of a decrease in interest rate of basis points 
assuming consistent investment levels as of september   interest income would decline by less than million 
assuming consistent investment levels as of september   interest income would decline by million 
foreign currency risk 
international revenues accounted for approximately of total revenues for the year ended september   compared to of total revenues for the year ended september  international revenues decreased million or compared to the prior year 
the company s international operations increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues and related expense generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries 
primary currencies include the united kingdom pound sterling  the euro and the canadian dollar 
the statement of operations is translated into united states dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the united states dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currencies denominated transactions results in reduced revenues  operating expense  and net income for our international operations 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses  and net income will increase for our international operations  if the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from  our international revenues for would have been higher than we reported by approximately million and our international income from operations would have been higher than million 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from  our international revenues for would have been lower than we reported by approximately million and our international income from operations would have been lower than we reported by million 

table of contents we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries and our investments in equity interests into united states dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into united states dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders equity 
in addition  we have certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations that will lead to a transaction gain or loss 
for the years ended september   and  we recorded net foreign currency transaction gains and losses  of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  which were recorded in other income expense  net  in the consolidated statements of operations 
during the quarter ended september   the value of the pound sterling and euro decreased approximately and against the us dollar  respectively 
in addition for the month of october  the value of the pound sterling and the euro decreased an additional and against the us dollar  respectively
