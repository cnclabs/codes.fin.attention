business description emrise designs  manufactures and markets proprietary electronic devices and communications equipment for aerospace  defense  industrial  and communications applications 
we have operations in the us  england  france and japan 
we conduct our business through two operating segments electronic devices and communications equipment 
our subsidiaries within our electronic devices segment design  develop  manufacture and market electronic devices for defense  aerospace and industrial markets 
our subsidiaries within our communications equipment segment design  develop  manufacture and market network access equipment  including network timing and synchronization products  for the communications industry 
our electronic devices segment produces a range of power systems  rf and microwave devices and electromechanical switches 
the electronic devices segment is project driven with the majority of revenues being derived from custom products with long life cycles and high barriers to entry 
the majority of manufacturing and testing is performed in house or through sub contract manufacturers 
our electronic devices are used in a wide range of military airborne  seaborne and land based systems  in flight entertainment systems  including the latest next generation ife c systems such as applications for mobile phone  e mail and internet communications and real time  on board satellite and broadcast television which are being retrofitted in existing commercial aircraft and installed in today s growing fleet of new commercial aircraft 
our communications equipment segment produces a range of network access products  including network timing and synchronization products  for public and private communications companies 
the communications equipment segment is end user product based with a traditional cycle of internally funded development and marketing prior to selling via direct and indirect sales channels 
manufacturing is primarily outsourced 
our communications equipment is used in a broad range of applications for military defense and homeland security  utility companies and independent and national telecommunications carriers 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from sales of electronic devices and communications equipment products and services 
our sales are based upon written agreements or purchase orders that identify the type and quantity of the item and or services being purchased and the purchase price 
we recognize revenues when shipment of products has occurred or services have been rendered  no significant obligations remain on our part  and collectability is reasonably assured based on our credit and collections practices and policies 
we recognize revenues from domestic sales of our electronic devices and communications equipment at the point of shipment of those products 
an estimate of warranty costs are recorded at the time the revenue is recognized 
product returns are infrequent and require prior authorization because our sales are final and we quality test our products prior to shipment to ensure the products meet the specifications of the binding purchase orders under which those products are shipped 
normally  when a customer requests and receives authorization to return a product  the request is accompanied by a purchase order for a repair or for a replacement product 
revenue recognition for products and services provided by our subsidiaries in england depends upon the type of contract involved 
engineering design services contracts generally entail design and production of a prototype over a term of up to several years  with revenue deferred until each milestone defined in the contract is reached 
production contracts provide for a specific quantity of products to be produced over a specific period of time 
customers issue binding purchase orders or enter into binding agreements for the products to be produced 
we recognize revenues on these orders as the products are shipped 
returns are infrequent and permitted only with prior authorization because these products are custom made to order based on binding purchase orders and are quality tested prior to shipment 
an estimate of warranty costs are recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
we recognize revenues for products sold by our french subsidiary at the point of shipment 
customer discounts are included in the product price list provided to the customer 
returns are infrequent and permitted only with prior authorization because these products are shipped based on binding purchase orders and are quality tested prior to shipment 
an estimate of warranty costs are recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
revenues from services such as repairs and modifications are recognized when the service is completed and invoiced 
for repairs that involve shipment of a repaired product  we recognize repair revenues when the product is shipped back to the customer 
service revenues contribute less than of total revenue and  therefore  are considered to be immaterial to overall financial results 
product warranty liabilities generally  our products carry a standard one year  limited parts and labor warranty 
in certain circumstances  we provide a two year limited parts and labor warranty on our communications test instruments and network access products 
we offer extended warranties beyond two years for an additional cost to our customers 
products returned under warranty typically are tested and repaired or replaced at our option 
historically  we have not experienced significant warranty costs or returns 
we record a liability for estimated costs that we expect to incur under our basic limited warranties when product revenue is recognized 
factors affecting our warranty liability include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of claim and costs per claim 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty liability accrual based on changes in these factors 
inventory valuation our finished goods electronic devices inventories generally are built to order 
our communications equipment inventories generally are built to forecast  which requires us to produce a larger amount of finished goods in our communications equipment business so that our customers can be served promptly 
our products consist of numerous electronic and other parts  which necessitates that we exercise detailed inventory management 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory first in  first out or the current estimated market value of the inventory net realizable value 
we perform cycle counts of inventories using an abc inventory methodology  which groups inventory items into cycle counting categories  or conduct physical inventories at least once a year 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next to months 
additionally  to determine inventory write down provisions  we review product line inventory levels and individual items as necessary and periodically review assumptions about forecasted demand and market conditions 
any inventory that we determine to be obsolete  either in connection with the physical count or at other times of observation  are reserved for and subsequently written off 
as of december   our total inventory reserves amounted to million of which million  or of total inventory  related to our electronic devices segment and million  or of total inventory  related to our communications equipment segment 
the electronics devices and communications equipment industries are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
also  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
foreign currency translation we have foreign subsidiaries that together accounted for approximately and of our net revenues  and of our assets and and of our total liabilities as of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from the functional currencies in which they keep their accounting records into us dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under relevant accounting guidance  are included either within our statement of operations under the caption other income expense or as a separate part of our net equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
under relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these translation gains or losses depends upon our management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
this determination involves consideration of relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures  would be considered the functional currency 
however  management must also consider any dependency of the subsidiary upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations 
if management deems any subsidiary s functional currency to be its local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included as a separate component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
however  if management deems the functional currency to be us dollars  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included in other income expense within our statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized into our statement of operations 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to us dollars  then any translation gains or losses arising after the date of the change would be included within our statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the functional currency of each of our international subsidiaries to be each subsidiary s local currency 
accordingly  we had cumulative translation gains of million and million that were included as part of accumulated other comprehensive income within our balance sheets at december  and december   respectively 
during the year ended december  and  we included translation gains of million and million  respectively  under accumulated other comprehensive income 
if we had determined that the functional currency of our subsidiaries was us dollars  these gains would have decreased our net loss for the year ended december  and the magnitude of these gains or losses depends upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business as compared to the value of the us dollar 
these currencies include the euro  the british pounds sterling and  to a lesser extent  the japanese yen 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher or lower than those we recorded for these periods 
a million british pounds sterling loan payable from one of our subsidiaries in england to emrise was outstanding as of december  million based on the exchange rate at december  
exchange rate losses and gains on the long term portion of this loan are recorded in cumulative translation gains or losses in the equity section of the balance sheet 
intangibles  including goodwill we periodically evaluate our intangibles  including goodwill  for potential impairment 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
in assessing potential impairment of goodwill  we consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance of the acquired businesses 
if forecasts are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of those respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that were not previously recorded 
if that were the case  we would have to record an expense in order to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to analyze our goodwill for impairment issues at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
at december   our reported goodwill totaled million 
during the year ended december   we did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
overview overall sales increased in as compared to sales were positively affected at our foreign subsidiaries in both of our operating segments  electronics devices and communications equipment  as a result of new contracts for power supplies  new ife c products  and network access products 
the sales increases experienced by our foreign subsidiaries were partially offset by sales declines experienced by our domestic subsidiaries 
while we continue to experience year over year decreases in our domestic sales  during the early part of we have experienced improvements in domestic sales of our power supplies for military customers and new tiempo edge network timing products due  in part  to new orders by a national communications carrier 
we expect continued growth in our foreign markets and we believe that our new tiempo product  new power supply products and our patented very low profile  or vlp  rotary switches will bring improved sales to our domestic operations as well 
overall gross margins decreased from in to in the declines in overall gross margins were primarily due to the remaining effects of transitioning the manufacturing of our domestic ro power supply products to a contract manufacturer  which commenced in the second quarter of and resulted in lower sales and higher initial production costs  the temporary higher costs associated with engineering and prototyping of our new ife c products at our subsidiaries in england  and changes in product mix as we are experiencing the impact of shifting from traditional higher margin  low growth products to lower margin  long term growth products 
we have made a conscious effort to develop and pursue product lines in areas where we expect substantial growth potential 
in some cases  these opportunities  such as existing products sold in the commercial ife c market  have lower margins as compared to our traditional higher margin military market resulting in lower overall average margins 
similarly  our rotary switch product line is comprised of lower margin products as compared to our traditional digital switch products  but with a substantial future growth potential 
in all cases  however  we expect that the overall higher anticipated sales volumes in these high growth areas will result in improved gross margin and overall improved profitability 
in contrast  our new tiempo products have both high growth potential and higher margin potential 
we expect our overall margins to increase slightly in as compared to the following is a further  more detailed discussion of our results of operations by segment 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  net sales year ended december  variance favorable unfavorable in thousands dollar percent electronic devices    as of net sales communications equipment    as of net sales total net sales    electronic devices the increase in sales of our electronic devices in as compared to is primarily due to a million increase in sales by our foreign subsidiaries 
this was primarily the result of significant military power supply sales by our subsidiary in england resulting from new contracts and also a result of increased sales of existing and new ife c products by our foreign subsidiaries 
this overall increase was partially offset by a million decline in sales at our domestic operations  primarily due to the impact of the transition of the manufacturing operations of our subsidiary  ro  to a contract manufacturer  which transition occurred during the second and third quarters of and during which time  we experienced temporary shipping delays in certain products 
the transition of ro to contract manufacturing was completed during the third quarter of shipments since then have stabilized and we expect ro shipments during to exceed shipment levels 
our domestic electronic device sales were also affected by reductions in us government stocking orders by the defense supply agency dsa for our digital switches 
sales of electronic devices are also expected to rise in  including sales of emrise s patented vlp rotary switches and ongoing sales growth of ife c equipment and systems 
new orders for the products during the first quarter have continued to show reason for optimism and shipments through march of this year have been higher compared to the same period last year 
communications equipment the increase in sales of our communications equipment in as compared to is primarily due to a million increase in network access equipment sales at our french subsidiary as a result of new domestic military and commercial business in europe as well as larger international orders 
this increase was partially offset by a million decline in our domestic operations as a result of decreases in sales of our central office timing products 
sales of our central office timing products have decreased year over year  in part  as a result of a market shift from central office products to edge network products and also due to our intentional effort to focus on edge network opportunities where we believe our tiempo product gives us a competitive advantage over competitors due to its cost  next generation capabilities  and other value added features 
we believe that our french subsidiary will continue to experience strong sales in of network access equipment to both military and commercial customers 
we also expect improved sales in at both our domestic and foreign operations as a result of anticipated increased shipments of our new tiempo product 
going forward  emrise expects continued growth in sales in foreign communications markets 
domestic sales are also expected to increase due to growing demand for edge network products  primarily tiempo  especially from anticipated opportunities with public communications carriers and other large scale customers  as evidenced by our recently announced orders from a national communications carrier in the us gross profit year ended december  variance favorable unfavorable in thousands dollar percent electronic devices   as of net sales communications equipment   as of net sales total gross profit   total gross margin electronic devices the decline in gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  for our electronic devices from in to in is primarily the result of a reduction in gross profit at ro of million  which occurred during the transition of ro s manufacturing operations to a contract manufacturer commencing in the second quarter of and which resulted in higher initial production costs throughout the transition period 
the transition of ro to contract manufacturing was completed during the third quarter of and gross margins stabilized during the th quarter of during  we expect ro operating income to significantly improve as compared to as the result of improved gross margins  lower operating costs  and higher order entry levels 
in addition  during  our gross profit was negatively impacted by temporary engineering and prototyping costs associated with our new ife c products and reductions in dsa stocking orders for higher margin digital switch products 
additionally  we are making a conscious effort to penetrate the lower margin commercial in flight entertainment market as we see substantial growth potential as compared to our traditional higher margin military market resulting in lower average margins for those products 
over time  we expect this strategy to result in higher operating profits as we believe that we will be able to increase sales at a higher rate than our operations costs 
communications equipment the slight increase in gross margin  as a percentage of net sales  for our communications equipment from in to in was the result of increased sales of higher margin military network access products at our french subsidiary resulting in a million increase in gross profit  offset in part by a million decrease in gross profit at our domestic subsidiaries due primarily to lower sales of our central office timing products 
during  we expect gross margins to remain constant at our french subsidiary and we expect gross margins to improve at our domestic subsidiary as a result of a significant increase in shipments of our new tiempo timing and synchronization product  which is manufactured for us by a contract manufacture and therefore  generally carries higher margins than traditional in house built central office and other network access products 
operating expenses year ended december  variance favorable unfavorable in thousands dollar percent selling  general and administrative   as of net sales engineering and product development   as of net sales total operating expenses    selling  general and administrative the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of million of costs for the restatement and reaudit of our and financial statements which were incurred in as compared to million which were incurred in these decreases were partially offset by million of non recurring costs relating to the consolidation of the operations of ro into our cxr larus corporation facility  million of additional sales and marketing costs associated with higher sales in our foreign electronic devices subsidiaries  and million related to an increase in compensation and other related expenses 
beginning the first quarter of and continuing throughout  we expect to incur significant expenses in connection with our efforts to comply with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of sox 
in particular  we expect to incur approximately  to  during the first quarter of in connection with our sox management assessment  which pursuant to sec guidelines for non accelerated filers  we are required to complete for the first time in connection with our financial statements 
further  during the remainder of the year  we will likely incur additional costs in connection with the remediation of certain internal control deficiencies which were identified as a result of our management assessment 
we are currently in the process of developing specific action plans in that regard  which we expect to complete by june  if we are able to complete these action plans by that date  we anticipate that all control deficiencies and material weaknesses will be remediated by december  we are uncertain at this time of the additional costs to remediate all of the control deficiencies and material weaknesses  however  we anticipate the cost to be in the range of  to  most of which costs we expect to incur in we cannot guarantee that the actual costs to remediate these deficiencies will not exceed this amount 
engineering and product development the decrease in engineering and product development costs is primarily due to reduced expenses for the development of our new tiempotm product line for which most of the costs were incurred in we expect engineering and development costs to be higher in as a result of additional tiempo engineering costs and ife c development activities 
interest expense interest expense was million for as compared to million for due to increased loan balances for our us  england and french operations and increased interest rates 
as a result of our recently completed debt financing in november  we expect interest expense to increase in by approximately million over expenses based on both higher outstanding balances and higher interest rates  which include the amortization of certain debt issuance costs 
loss on early extinguishment of debt loss on early extinguishment of debt was million for relating to the exit costs associated with the early termination of our existing credit facilities and term loans 
we did not incur such a loss in other income expense we generated other income of million for compared to other expense of approximately million for other income for included a one time accrual reversal related to the satisfactory resolution of a employee related legal dispute at our french subsidiary 
other expense for consisted primarily of short term exchange rate gains and losses associated with the volatility of the us dollar to the british pounds sterling and euro on the current portion of certain assets and liabilities 
income tax expense income tax expense amounted to million for compared to million for income tax expense is the result of foreign income tax on foreign earned profits in europe and japan 
net loss we reported a net loss of million in and a net loss of million in this reduction in net loss for was primarily a result of the inclusions of million in restatement related costs in as compared to only million of such costs in additional factors that contributed to the current year net loss were as follows a million operating loss in at our us electronic device division as compared to an operating loss of million in million or decline  primarily due to a temporary reduction in sales and temporary deterioration in gross margin during the second and third quarters of as a result of the conversion to contract manufacturing  a  operating loss at our us communications division  primarily due to lower sales of our central office timing products  an area which we intentionally chose not to pursue during in lieu of developing and marketing our tiempo timing and synchronization product line  which we believe provides better competitive opportunities for us and which  during  we expect a significant increase in shipments of  a million reduction in operating profit at our domestic digitran switch division  due primarily to a reduction in dsa orders in  and lower margins in our electronic devices segment generated from our intentional shift in product mix from higher margin  low growth products to lower margin  high growth products such as ife c products 
the above factors were partially offset by a million improvement in operating profit at our french subsidiary during as compared to  due to higher sales of network access equipment 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  net sales year ended december  variance favorable unfavorable in thousands dollar percent electronic devices    as of net sales communications equipment    as of net sales total net sales    electronic devices the increase in sales of our electronic devices was primarily due to a million increase in sales of power supplies in compared to contributing to this increase was a million increase in sales of power supplies due to inclusion of a full year sales in as compared to only four months of sales included in  due to the acquisition of ro on august  our subsidiary  pascall electronics limited pascall  increased it sales of power supplies by million to million in however  because we acquired pascall on march   only nine and one half months of sales for pascall were included in our sales 
the remainder of the million increase in sales of power supplies was due to an increase in sales volume of our subsidiary  xcel power systems  ltd  xps 
sales of rf devices by pascall increased by million to million in as compared to million in due to increased sales volume 
sales of switches were million  which approximated sales of switches in the prior year 
communications equipment the majority of the decrease in sales of our communications equipment was due to a million decrease in sales of test equipment in as compared to this decrease was mainly due to a lower volume of sales caused by the erosion of the communications industry customer base for our test instruments as a result of our decision to cease investing in this product line 
this decision resulted in us selling primarily to customers providing upgrades for a federal aviation administration modernization project 
sales of our network access and transmission products decreased million to million in as compared to million in this decrease resulted from a million decrease in our cxr larus us based sales primarily due to decreased sales volume as a result of reductions in sales of central office network equipment  offset by a million increase in our french based sales due to increased sales volume 
partially offsetting these decreases was a modest increase in the sales of our timing systems by cxr larus 
gross profit year ended december  variance favorable unfavorable in thousands dollar percent electronic devices    as of net sales communications equipment    as of net sales total gross profit   total gross margin electronic devices the increase in gross profit of our electronic devices was primarily due to a million increase in our power supply operations in england 
of this increase  pascall provided million due to an increase in sales volume and inclusion of a full year of operations in and xps contributed million due to increased sales volume 
also contributing to the increase in gross profit was the addition of a full year of gross profit for ro 
gross profit for switches produced by our digitran division remained constant 
communications equipment the reduction in gross profit of our communications equipment was primarily due to a million decrease in test equipment gross profit due to decreased sales volume 
in addition  gross profit for our cxr larus communication timing and network access products declined million due to a decrease in sales volume and a decrease in inventory carrying values for certain items deemed to be slow moving 
the gross profit at our french subsidiary declined million due to a decrease in sales volume and a change in accounting policy necessitating an inventory write down 
operating expenses year ended december  variance favorable unfavorable in thousands dollar percent selling  general and administrative    as of net sales engineering and product development   as of net sales total operating expenses    selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a result of the following million of administrative expenses related to the restatement of our and financial statements and the reaudit of our  and financial statements 
the million of administrative expenses included million of audit expense as compared to million in and million of legal and other expense  an increase in administrative expenses primarily due to the increase and inclusion of million and million of administrative costs for pascall and ro  respectively  and a million expense related to increasing employee compensation related reserves 
engineering and product development engineering and product development expenses consist primarily of new product development engineering activities 
the increase in these expenses resulted primarily from the increase of million in expenses attributable to our decision to accelerate the introduction of our tiempo  a new edge network timing and synchronization product  and a million increase in engineering expenses attributable to roa 
the increase in engineering expense for the tiempo product was mainly due to million of contract engineering expenses we incurred in to accelerate product development of this new edge network timing and synchronization product 
these increases were partially offset by a million reduction of engineering expenses for switches and power supplies 
interest expense and income interest expense was approximately million for and the slight increase in interest expense in was a result of larger loan balances 
we recorded million in interest income in  which we earned primarily on the proceeds of our january private placement of equity securities 
other income expense other expense in of million was primarily due to currency exchange losses 
other income of million in primarily resulted from a million gain due to the sale of our t com product line and a million net currency exchange gain 
the t com technology and tangible assets had no carrying value 
income tax the million in income tax expense in includes million of foreign taxes and million of domestic taxes 
we recorded a provision for federal tax in to reduce our deferred tax assets for federal purposes and to reduce the amount of operating loss carryforwards recognized 
an income tax benefit of million was recorded in primarily because we reduced our tax asset valuation allowance by million and recorded a federal tax benefit of million that was offset by a foreign tax provision of million 
net loss net loss for was million as compared to net income of million for major contributors to this million difference were as follows million of administrative expenses related to the restatement and reaudit of our financial statements  a million lower gross profit of our communications equipment segment primarily due to decreased sales volume  a million increase in a tax provision primarily due to the million reduction in our tax asset valuation allowance in and increases in foreign and state taxes in  a million decrease in other income and loss primarily due to currency exchange losses in as compared to a million net currency exchange gain in  and a million expense related to increasing employee compensation related expenses 
these negative amounts were partially offset by a million increase in gross profit related to sales of our electronic devices which  in turn  was primarily due to a million increase in net sales of these products 
liquidity and capital resources in making an assessment of our liquidity  we believe that the items in our financial statements that are most relevant are our working capital  cash generated from our operating activities and cash available from our financing activities 
during  we funded our daily cash flow requirements through funds provided by operations and through borrowings from our new credit facility with gvec resource iv inc gvec  an affiliate of private equity management group llc pem group  our prior domestic revolving credit facilities with wells fargo bank acting through its wells fargo business credit operating division wfbc  and credit facilities with various foreign banks 
working capital was million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase in working capital is primarily the result of the increase in cash balances related to our new debt financing 
additionally  the current structure of the new line of credit is such that it is classified as long term where the previous lines of credit were classified short term 
at december  and  we had accumulated deficits of million and million  respectively  and cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities during totaled million as compared to million in other than the net loss of million  the only other significant use of cash in operations during was an increase in inventory of million  which was primarily due to increases in sales at our foreign subsidiaries 
during  we experienced a million  or  increase in sales at our foreign electronic devices subsidiaries and a million  or  increase in sales at our foreign communication equipment subsidiary 
significant sources of cash associated with operating activities during included i a reduction in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million as a result of more timely payments to vendors for aged payables and ii depreciation and amortization expense which totaled million during both and  but which is a non cash expense 
cash used in our investing activities totaled million for as compared to million in the amount consists of net increases to property  plant and equipment 
we have guaranteed obligations of emrise electronics in connection with the pascall acquisition and have agreed to indemnify pascall s former parent in connection with obligations under pascall s facilities lease 
cash provided by our financing activities totaled million in during  we retired revolving bank debt of million and borrowed million under our new credit facility with gvec 
during the year  we also borrowed approximately million under prior revolving lines of credit  which amounts were subsequently paid off  and paid approximately million towards the repayment of long term debt and or notes to stockholders 
in connection with entering into our new gvec credit facility  we paid million in issuance costs  and issued a seven year warrant to pem group to purchase  shares of emrise restricted common stock  at an exercise price of per share 
as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under gvec credit facility  remaining actual availability under a formula based calculation of million and contractual availability of million under the same facility 
actual remaining availability represents the additional amount we were eligible to borrow as of december  maximum contractual availability represents the maximum amount of availability provided under the contract as of that date and includes the actual remaining availability 
in addition to the revolving lines of credit  at december   we had long term loans and capitalized lease and equipment loan obligations totaling million  the current portion of which loans and obligations totaled million 
our backlog decreased slightly to million as of december  as compared to million as of december  the amount of backlog orders represents revenue that we anticipate recognizing in the future  as evidenced by purchase orders and other purchase commitments received from customers  but on which work has not yet been initiated or with respect to which work is currently in progress 
our backlog as of december  was approximately related to our electronic devices business  which business tends to provide us with long lead times for our manufacturing processes due to the custom nature of the products  and approximately related to our communications equipment business  which business tends to deliver standard or modified standard products from stock as orders are received 
we believe that the majority of our current backlog is shippable within the next months 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in fulfilling such orders and commitments in a timely manner or that we will ultimately recognize as revenue the amounts reflected as backlog 
existing credit facility on november   emrise corporation and its direct subsidiaries  emrise electronics corporation  cxr larus corporation and ro collectively  the borrowers entered into a credit agreement with gvec  providing for a three year credit facility in the aggregate amount of  and is secured by accounts receivable  other rights to payment and general intangibles  inventories and equipment 
the gvec credit facility consists of i a one year revolving credit facility for up to  that may be extended for up to three years the revolver  ii a three year term loan in an outstanding principal amount of  which was fully funded on november   and iii a three year term loan in the amount of  to be used solely for possible acquisitions to be made within months of november  the revolver is formula based and generally provides that the outstanding borrowings under the line of credit may not exceed an aggregate of of eligible accounts receivable  plus of the value of eligible raw materials not to exceed  plus of the value of eligible finished goods inventory not to exceed  minus the aggregate amount of reserves that may be established by gvec 
interest on the revolver is payable monthly 
the interest rate is variable and is adjusted monthly based on prime rate as published in the money rates column of the wall street journal the base rate plus  subject to a minimum rate of 
the revolver is subject to various financial covenants on a consolidated basis  including the following ebitda  measured on a fiscal quarter end basis  must not be less than the scheduled amount for each specified period  the debt service coverage ratio  measured quarterly  must be greater than the lesser of the scheduled amount for each specific period or  the leverage ratio  measured quarterly  must not be greater than  and we must not incur capital expenditures in any fiscal year in excess of  the term loans bear interest at the base rate plus  subject to a minimum rate of  and require interest only payments in the first year  scheduled principal plus interest payments in years two and three  and a final balloon payment at the end of year three

on november   in connection with entering into the new credit facility with gvec  we terminated the wfbc credit facility 
as of december   we had balances of  outstanding on the wfbc revolving line of credit and  outstanding on the term loan 
availability on the wfbc revolving line of credit was  as of december   we were not in compliance with the loan s financial covenants for net worth and net losses 
we obtained a waiver from wfbc for those covenant violations

overall  we believe that current and future capital resources  revenues generated from operations and other existing sources of liquidity  including our gvec credit facility  will be adequate to meet our anticipated short term  working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next months 
however  if we experience significant loss of revenue or increase in costs  our cash flow could be negatively impacted resulting in a cash flow deficit 
as a result  we may require additional financing 
this financing could be in the form of a revised debt structure with our existing lender  new financing with another lender or lenders  the sale of additional equity to raise capital  or the sale of certain assets to generate cash 
our failure to raise capital  if needed  ability to sell assets when needed and or ability to secure additional financing could restrict our growth  limit our development of new products or hinder our ability to compete
