we are subject to the effects of foreign currency fluctuations that have an impact on net sales and gross profits 
currency fluctuations increased net sales by in fiscal and in fiscal and decreased net sales by in growth rates for the last three fiscal years are indicated in the tables below percentage increases in net sales from fiscal from fiscal to to fiscal fiscal total by geographic region north america europe asia pacific 
table of contents percentage increases in net sales excluding the impact of currency fluctuations from fiscal from fiscal to to fiscal fiscal total by geographic region north america europe asia pacific net sales in north america grew from fiscal to fiscal driven by growth in most of our markets  including an increase in our hplc products and growth in sales of both rfic instrumentation and consumables 
net sales in europe grew in reported dollars net of currency fluctuations from fiscal to fiscal reflecting a growth in ic products and a weaker us dollar offset partially by softer demand in our larger life sciences customers in the second half of the fiscal year 
net sales in the asia pacific region grew in reported dollars net of currency fluctuation driven by continued sales force expansion and higher demand in china  korea  india and australia from our chemical petrochemical  environmental and food and beverage customers

direct sales accounted for of net sales in fiscal  compared with in fiscal and in fiscal international distributors and representatives in europe  asia and other international markets accounted for the balance of net sales 
there were no significant price changes during the years ended june   and net sales of ic products grew from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal driven mostly by higher demand from our environmental and industrial customers for our rfic instrumentation  consumables and services across all major geographies 
net sales of hplc products grew by from fiscal to fiscal driven primarily by increased sales in north america and asia pacific  partially offset by weaker demand in europe in the second half of fiscal sales of hplc products grew from fiscal to fiscal primarily as a result of our continued expansion of our global hplc business  offset by some weakness in certain larger pharmaceutical accounts  especially in north america  and the product transition from our older summit hplc product line to the new ultimate system 
gross margin gross margin for fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or and in  gross margin was million 
gross margin as a percentage of sales was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales from fiscal to fiscal was mainly due to the weaker growth in europe partially offset by a weaker us dollar

we anticipate gross margin will be approximately for fiscal year operating expenses from fiscal to fiscal from fiscal to fiscal  overall operating expenses increased by to million 
the increase in expenses in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to the following factors currency fluctuations continued expansion efforts in the asia pacific region increased depreciation and infrastructure expense increased salary and commission in north america

interest income interest income in fiscal of million was higher than million reported for fiscal and higher than the million reported in fiscal the increase in fiscal from fiscal was due to higher yields on higher cash balances held outside of the us the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due to declining interest rates in the united states and europe 
interest expense interest expense of  in fiscal was higher than the  in fiscal and  fiscal the interest expense was primarily due to higher level short term borrowings in both fiscal and other income expense  net other expense  net in fiscal was million  which was primarily due to losses on our derivatives related to our japanese subsidiary and losses on foreign currency exchanges 
we had other income  net in fiscal of  and million in fiscal 
table of contents income taxes our effective tax rate was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal our effective tax rate is affected by the mix of taxable income among the various tax jurisdictions in which we do business 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to foreign tax credits  expiration of tax exposures and mix of taxable income in our various tax jurisdictions 
the decrease in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to special tax charges recorded in fiscal related to exposure from two tax audits 
earnings per share diluted earnings per share were  an increase of compared with the reported for fiscal and in fiscal net income for fiscal was higher due to higher revenues and lower corporate taxes 
liquidity and capital resources at june   we had cash and equivalents and short term investments of million

cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase of cash used in fiscal compared to was due to higher capital expenditures related to facility renovation costs in sunnyvale  oracle upgrade and world wide rollout project costs  tooling costs in both germany and sunnyvale and the payment for accrued patent acquisition costs 
except for the world wide oracle upgrade that is expected to complete in fiscal  other capital expenditures that attributed to the increased cash usage during fiscal are not expected to be recurring events 
the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was due to lower net proceeds from sale of marketable securities in fiscal  partially offset by higher capital expenditures due to expansion of our hplc manufacturing and development facility in germany and the acquisition of the polymer based monolithic technology from teledyne isco  a subsidiary of teledyne technologies  inc cash used for financing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal financing activities for all three years consisted primarily of common stock repurchases  partially offset by proceeds from issuances of shares pursuant to and the tax benefits related to stock option plans in fiscal we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million in fiscal   shares for million in fiscal and  shares for million in fiscal  under our repurchase program 
we have  remaining shares authorized for repurchase under our repurchase programs at june  at june   our available bank lines of credit totaled million  compared with million at june  we believe our cash flow from operations  our existing cash and cash equivalents and our bank lines of credit will be adequate to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
the impact of inflation on our financial position and results of operations was not significant during any of the periods presented

critical accounting policies and estimates summary 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns and allowances  bad debts  inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  warranty and installation provisions  and contingencies  on an on going basis 

table of contents we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition policy 
we derive revenues from the sale of products and the delivery of services to our customers  including installation  training  time and material repairs  and maintenance  which consists of product repair obligations  telephone support  and or unspecified software upgrades 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  or service performed  the price is fixed or determinable  collection is probable and vendor specific objective evidence or objective reliable evidence of fair value  as applicable  exists to allocate revenue to the various elements of the arrangement 
in all cases  the portion of revenue allocated to the undelivered elements is deferred until those items are delivered to the customer or the services are performed 
delivery of the product is generally considered to have occurred when shipped 
undelivered elements in our sales arrangements  which are not considered to be essential to the functionality of a product  generally include maintenance  installation services and or training that are delivered after the related products have been delivered 
installation consists of system set up  calibration and basic functionality training and generally requires one to three days depending on the product 
fair value for training services is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately or  if not sold separately  when the price is established by authorized management 
the fair value of installation services is calculated by applying standard service billing rates to the estimate of the number of hours to install a specific product based on historical experience 
these estimated hours for installation have historically been accurate and consistent from product to product 
however  to the extent these estimates were to reflect unfavorable variability  our ability to maintain objective reliable evidence of fair value for such element could be impacted which in turn could delay the recognition of the revenue currently allocated to the delivered elements 
prior to fiscal  the fair value of maintenance contracts was based on the price charged when an element was sold separately or  if not yet sold separately  when the price was established by authorized management 
maintenance fees were recognized ratably over the period of the related maintenance contracts  which ranged from one to two years 
maintenance consisted of product repair obligations  telephone support  and or unspecified software upgrades 
effective july   unspecified software upgrades are no longer provided with our maintenance contracts 
as such  revenue from separately priced extended maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized in income on a straight line basis over the contract period  in accordance with ftb  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
our sales are typically not subject to rights of return and  historically  actual sales returns have not been significant 
the ability to maintain fair value for undelivered elements and other judgments may affect our reported revenues 
product warranty 
our equipment typically includes a one year warranty 
the estimated cost of product warranty claims is accrued at the time the sale is recognized  based on historical experience 
while we believe our historical experience provides a reliable basis for estimating such warranty cost  unforeseen quality issues or component failure rates could result in future costs in excess of such estimates  or alternatively  improved quality and reliability in our products could result in actual expenses that are below those currently estimated 
loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of any of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we assess collectability based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  past transaction history with the customer  the credit worthiness of the customer  independent credit reports  industry trends and the macro economic environment 
sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period 
historically  we have not experienced significant sales returns or bad debt losses 

table of contents we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost which approximates cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
our estimated valuation provisions on inventory are based on technical obsolescence  historical demand  projections of future demand and industry and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional valuation provisions may be required 
if demand or market conditions are more favorable than projected  higher margins could be realized to the extent inventory is sold which had previously been written down 
long lived assets  intangible assets with finite lives and goodwill 
we assess for the impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets with finite lives and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in addition  we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or developments in strategic technology 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above or other indicators  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair values of related reporting units to their carrying values 
we are required to perform an impairment review for goodwill at least annually 
taxes on income 
as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to the complexity of the tax laws that we are subject to in several tax jurisdictions 
this process involves our estimate of our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and inventory reserves for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included with our consolidated balance sheets 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
on july   we adopted fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
as a result of the implementation of fin no 
 we recognize the tax liability for uncertain income tax positions on the income tax return based on the two step process prescribed in the interpretation 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that each income tax position would be sustained upon audit 
the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority 
estimating these amounts requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we evaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on the consideration of several factors  including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in applicable tax law  settlement of issues under audit  and new exposures 
if we later determine that our exposure is lower or that the liability is not sufficient to cover our revised expectations  we adjust the liability and effect a related change in our tax provision during the period in which we make such determination 
stock based compensation 
sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their 
table of contents fair value 
we have used the black scholes model to determine the fair value of our stock option awards 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting periods 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date required judgment  including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock options exercise behaviors 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense recognized in our results of operations could be materially affected 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest  the amount of the expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r  the compensation expense that we record in the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and stock prices of marketable securities 
with the exception of the stock price volatility of our marketable equity securities  we manage our exposure to these and other risks through our regular operating and financing activities and  when appropriate  through our hedging activities 
our policy is not to use hedges or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we deal with a diversified group of major financial institutions to limit the risk of nonperformance by any one institution on any financial instrument 
separate from our financial hedging activities  material changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and  to a lesser extent  commodity prices could cause significant changes in the costs to manufacture and deliver our products and in customers buying practices 
we have not substantially changed our risk management practices during fiscal and we do not currently anticipate significant changes in financial market risk exposures in the near future that would require us to change our current risk management practices 
we enter into standard indemnification agreements with many of our customers and certain other business partners in the ordinary course of business 
these agreements include provisions for indemnifying the customer against any claim brought by a third party to the extent any such claim alleges that our product infringes a patent  copyright or trademark  or violates any other proprietary rights of that third party 
the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is not estimable  however  we have not incurred any costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements 
no material claims for such indemnifications were outstanding as of june  we have not recorded any liabilities for these indemnification agreements at june  or foreign currency exchange 
revenues generated from international operations are generally denominated in foreign currencies 
we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against fluctuations of intercompany account balances 
market value gains and losses on these hedge contracts are substantially offset by fluctuations in the underlying balances being hedged  and the net financial impact is not expected to be material in future periods 
at june   we had forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currencies totaling million  including approximately million in euros  million in japanese yen  million in australian dollars and million in canadian dollars 
at june   we had forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currencies totaling million  including approximately million in euros  million in japanese yen  million in australian dollars and million in canadian dollars 
the foreign exchange contracts at the end of each fiscal year mature within the first quarter of the following fiscal year 
additionally  contract values and fair market values are the same 
in march  we entered into a million cross currency swap arrangement for japanese yen that matures in march and functions as a cash flow hedge of the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate exposure of the company s net investment in its japanese subsidiary 
this derivative instrument  did not qualify for net investment hedge accounting and was deemed to be an ineffective hedge instrument because  at the inception of the hedge transaction  there was no formal documentation of the hedging relationship and our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
therefore  we marked to market the decrease in value of approximately million for the six months ended december  and this amount was recorded in other 
table of contents income expense  net 
in january  we completed our formal documentation of the hedging relationship and determined that the cross currency swap qualified as a net investment hedge 
as a result  during the six months ended june   we marked to market million in unrealized losses associated with the hedge  which is reported in accumulated other comprehensive income as part of the foreign currency translation adjustment 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to our hedging contracts and underlying balances being hedged at june  and indicated that these market movements would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
foreign currency rate fluctuations can impact the us dollar translation of our foreign operations in our consolidated financial statements 
currency fluctuations increased sales by in fiscal  in fiscal and decreased sales by in fiscal interest and investment income 
our interest and investment income is subject to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our investment balances at june  and indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on our actual balances and changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movements 
debt and interest expense 
at june   we had short term notes payable of  a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our outstanding debt balance at june   indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movements and the level of borrowings maintained by us
