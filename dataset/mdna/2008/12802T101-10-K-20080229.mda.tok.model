we incur routine drydock  inspection  maintenance and repair costs pursuant to us coast guard regulations and in order to maintain our vessels in class under the rules of the applicable class society 
for  these costs were million 
these costs can fluctuate widely from year to year based on the number of vessels  the scope of the related work plan  availability of drydock capacity and general prevailing market conditions 
in addition to complying with these requirements  we have our own vessel maintenance program that we believe permits us to continue to provide our customers with well maintained  reliable vessels 
in the normal course of business  we charter other vessels on a short term basis  such as tugboats  cargo barges  utility boats and dive support vessels

item legal proceedings insurance and legal proceedings our operations are subject to the inherent risks of offshore marine activity  including accidents resulting in personal injury and the loss of life or property  environmental mishaps  mechanical failures  fires and collisions 
we insure against these risks at levels consistent with industry standards 
we also carry workers compensation  maritime employer s liability  general liability and other insurance customary in our business 
all insurance is carried at levels of coverage and deductibles we consider financially prudent 
our services are provided in hazardous environments where accidents involving catastrophic damage or loss of life could occur  and litigation arising from such an event may result in our being named a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims 
although there can be no assurance the amount of insurance we carry is sufficient to protect us fully in all events  or that such insurance will continu e to be available at current levels of cost or coverage  we believe that our insurance protection is adequate for our business operations 
a successful liability claim for which we are underinsured or uninsured could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are involved in various legal proceedings  primarily involving claims for personal injury under the general maritime laws of the united states and the jones act as a result of alleged negligence 
in addition  we from time to time incur other claims  such as contract disputes  in the normal course of business 
under our agreements with helix  we have assumed and agreed to indemnify helix for liabilities related to our business 
tax assessment during the fourth quarter of  horizon received a tax assessment from the servicio de administracion tributaria sat  the mexican taxing authority  for approximately million related to fiscal  including penalties  interest and monetary correction 
the sat s assessment claims unpaid taxes related to services performed among our subsidiaries 
we believe under the mexico and united states double taxation treaty that these services are not taxable and that the tax assessment itself is invalid 
on february   we received notice from the sat upholding the original assessment 
we believe that our position is supported by law and intend to vigorously defend our position 
however  the ultimate outcome of this litigation and our potential liability from this assessment  if any  cannot be determined at this time 
nonetheless  an unfavorable outcome with respect to the mexico ta x assessment could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial position and results of operation

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated and combined financial statements and their notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as those set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
our business we generate revenue principally by providing marine contracting services to major and independent oil and natural gas producers  pipeline transmission companies and offshore engineering and construction firms 
we perform our services under dayrate or qualified turnkey contracts that are typically awarded through a competitive bid process 
contract terms vary according to market conditions and services rendered 
see item business contracting and tendering 
major influences on results of operations our business is substantially dependent upon the condition of the oil and natural gas industry and  in particular  the willingness of oil and natural gas companies to make capital expenditures for offshore exploration  development and production operations 
the level of capital expenditures generally depends on the prevailing views of future oil and natural gas prices  which are influenced by numerous factors  including but not limited to changes in united states and international economic conditions including the potential for a recession  demand for oil and natural gas  especially in the united states  china and india  worldwide political conditions  particularly in significant oil producing regions such as the middle east  west africa and latin america  actions taken by opec  the availability and discovery rate of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas  the rate of decline of existing and new oil and natural gas reserves  the cost of offshore exploration for  and production and transportation of  oil and natural gas  the ability of oil and natural gas companies to generate funds or otherwise obtain external capital for exploration  development  construction and production operations  the sale and expiration dates of offshore leases in the united states and overseas  technological advances affecting energy exploration  production  transportation and consumption  weather conditions  environmental or other government regulations both domestic and foreign  domestic and foreign tax policies  and the pace adopted by foreign governments for the exploration  development and production of their oil and gas reserves 
the primary leading indicators we rely upon to forecast the performance of our business are crude oil and natural gas prices  the level of capital expenditures by oil and gas exploration and development companies  and drilling activity on the gulf of mexico ocs  as measured by mobile offshore rig counts 
demand for our services generally lags successful drilling activity by a period of six to months and can be longer 
in recent years  crude oil and natural gas prices have increased substantially  with the quarterly average of the nymex west texas intermediate wti near month crude oil daily average contract price increasing from a low of per barrel in the second quarter of to a high of per barrel in the fourth quarter of  and the quarterly average of the henry hub natural gas daily average spot price increasing from a low of per one million british thermal units  or mmbtu  in the third quarter of to a high of per mmbtu in the fourth quarter of however  oil and natural gas prices can be extremely volatile 
as of december  and february   the nymex wti near month crude oil closing contract price was and  respectively  and the henry hub natural gas closing spot price was and  respectively 
the majority of our customers on the gulf of mexico ocs are drilling for  producing and transporting natural gas 
therefore  we expect sustained directional changes in natural gas prices will have a greater impact on demand for our services in the gulf of mexico than changes in crude oil prices 
while us natural gas prices generally declined in recent months primarily due to moderate weather and the restoration of shut in gulf of mexico production  we believe long term price trends will be driven by us natural gas demand  the productivity of existing fields and new discoveries  and the availability of imports 
from to  the rig count on the gulf of mexico ocs increased more modestly than rig counts in other offshore regions due to the mobilization of rigs from the gulf of mexico to other regions and the impairment of offshore rigs caused by hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico in and  and has steadily declined since while demand for our marine contracting services is typically highly correlated with offshore rig counts  increases in subsea project complexity and capital spending per project as well as a sharp rise in the demand for hurricane related repair work have been the primary drivers of the record utilization and day rates we have achieved recently across our fleet of vessels 
we believe vessel utilization is one of the most important performance measurements for our business 
utilization provides a good indication of demand for our vessels and  as a result  the contract rates we may charge for our services 
as a marine contractor  our vessel utilization is typically lower during the first quarter  and to a lesser extent during the fourth quarter  due to winter weather conditions in the gulf of mexico 
accordingly  we normally plan our drydock inspections and other routine and preventive maintenance programs during this period 
the bid and award process during the first two quarters typically leads to the commencement of construction activities during the second and third quarters 
as a result  we have historically generated a majority of our revenues in the last six months of the year 
from through the first three quarters of fiscal  we did not experience the typical seasonal trends in our business due to the impact of hurricanes ivan  katrina and rita in the gulf of mexico 
the severe offshore infrastructure damage caused by these storms generated significant year round demand for our services from oil and gas companies trying to restore shut in production 
we believe this production restoration focus  along with the limited number of qualified marine contractors  has led to increased platform installation and removal work during that period 
with the expected increase in offshore construction activity levels in international basins  we have repositioned the texas  a dp dsv with recently installed saturation diving capabilities  to the mediterranean and the middle east  and the mystic viking  a dp dsv to trinidad 
these vessels join the sea horizon  a combination derrick pipelay barge and the eclipse  a dp dsv  which are both in southeast asia  to take advantage of international opportunities 
we continue to monitor international markets and intend to reposition certain vessels as opportunities arise 
the outlook for our business remains favorable based on our projected demand for construction  inspection  maintenance and repair services in the gulf of mexico as well as our significant international growth opportunities  however  market conditions in the gulf of mexico ocs are easing from the peak levels experienced in recent quarters as the amount of hurricane related repair activity moderates  and beginning in the fourth quarter of we began to experience a return to the more customary seasonal conditions described above 
as shown in the table below  during the fourth quarter of and all four quarters of  our average fleet utilization rates  while strong  were below the levels achieved in the fourth quarter of and the first three quarters of we believe that our fleet utilization and contract pricing  particularly for our saturation diving and pipelay vessels  will remain strong in  but we expect they will continue to ease from the recent record levels 
however  if future storms cause severe damage to gulf of mexico infrastructure  we would expect another sharp rise in the demand for our services

factors impacting comparability of our financial results our historical results of operations for the periods presented may not be comparable with prior periods or to our results of operations in the future for the reasons discussed below 
recent acquisitions on december   we completed an acquisition of horizon  following which horizon became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
upon completion of the acquisition  each share of common stock  par value per share  of horizon was converted into the right to receive in cash and shares of the company s common stock 
all shares of horizon restricted stock that had been issued but had not vested prior to the effective time of the merger became fully vested at the effective time of the merger and converted into the right to receive the merger consideration 
the company issued an aggregate of approximately million shares of common stock and paid approximately million in cash to the former horizon stockholders upon completion of the acquisition 
the cash portion of the merger consideration was paid from cash on hand and from borrowings of million under our new million credit facility  which consists of a million senior secured term loan and a million senior secured revolving credit facility 
see liquidity and capital resources credit facility 
in july  we completed the purchase of the business of singapore based fraser diving  including six portable saturation diving systems and surface diving systems operating primarily in the middle east  southeast asia and australia  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  subject to post closing adjustments 
in august  we acquired six vessels and a portable saturation diving system from torch at a cost of million including assets held for sale 
in november  we completed the acquisition of the diving and shallow water pipelay business of acergy  including seven diving support vessels  a portable saturation diving system  general diving equipment and operating bases located in louisiana  for a purchase price of million 
under the terms of a consent decree between the company and the united states department of justice to address certain anti competitive effects of the acergy and torch acquisitions alleged by the doj  we were required to divest two diving support vessels and a portable saturation diving system from the combined acquisitions 
we completed the sale of the portable saturation diving system and one diving support vessel in  and completed the sale of the second diving support vessel in january in addition  we acquired the dlb from acergy for million in january we subsequently sold a interest in the vessel in january for approximately million and entered into a year charter lease agreement with the purchaser  that included an option to purchase the remaining interest in the vessel beginning in january in december we agreed to accelerate this option  and sold our remaining interest to the lessee for cash consideration of million 
we also acquired the kestrel from acergy for approximately million in march going forward  we believe these acquired assets will be significant contributors to our financial results 
business segment information the company has one reportable segment  marine contracting 
the company performs a portion of its marine contracting services in foreign waters 
for the years ended december   and  the company derived revenues of million  million and million  respectively  from foreign locations 
net property and equipment in foreign locations were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the remainder of the company s revenues were generated in the us gulf of mexico and other us waters 
our relationship with helix for periods prior to december   our consolidated and combined financial statements have been derived from the financial statements and accounting records of helix using the historical results of operations and historical bases of assets and liabilities of our business 
certain management  administrative and operational services of helix have been shared between helix s shallow water marine contracting business and other helix business segments for all periods presented 
for purposes of financial statement presentation  the costs included in our consolidated and combined statements of operations for these shared services have been allocated to us based on actual direct costs incurred  headcount  work hours or revenues 
we and helix consider these allocations to be a reasonable reflection of our respective utilization of services provided 
pursuant to the corporate services agreement between helix and us  we are requ ired to utilize these services from helix in the conduct of our business until such time as helix owns less than of the total voting power of our common stock or earlier  if mutually agreed between helix and us 
additionally  helix primarily used a centralized approach to cash management and the financing of its operations 
accordingly  all related acquisition activity between helix and us and all other cash transactions for the period prior to our initial public offering have been reflected in our stockholders equity as helix s net investment 
we believe the assumptions underlying the consolidated and combined financial statements are reasonable 
however  the effect of these assumptions  the separation from helix and our operating as a standalone public entity could impact our results of operations and financial position prospectively by increasing expenses in areas that include but are not limited to litigation and other legal matters  compliance with the sarbanes oxley act and other corporate compliance matters  insurance and claims management and the related cost of insurance  as well as general overall purchasing power 
vessel utilization we believe vessel utilization is one of the most important performance measurements for our business 
as a marine contractor  our vessel utilization is typically lower during the first quarter  and to a lesser extent during the fourth quarter  due to winter weather conditions in the gulf of mexico 
from through the first three quarters of fiscal  we had not experienced the typical seasonal trends in our business due to the impact of hurricanes ivan  katrina and rita in the gulf of mexico 
however  market conditions in the gulf of mexico ocs are easing from the peak levels experienced in recent quarters as the amount of hurricane related repair activity moderates 
beginning in the fourth quarter of we began to experience a return to more customary seasonal conditions 
as shown in the table below  this has impacted primarily our surface diving vessels  while utilization for our saturation diving and construction barges has remained strong 
the following table shows the size of our fleet and effective utilization of our vessels during the past three fiscal years number of vessels utilization number of vessels utilization number of vessels utilization saturation diving surface and mixed gas diving construction barges entire fleet as of the end of the period and excluding acquired vessels prior to their in service dates  vessels taken out of service prior to their disposition and vessels jointly owned by a third party 
average vessel utilization is calculated by dividing the total number of days the vessels generated revenues by the total number of days the vessels were available for operation in each quarter and does not reflect acquired vessels prior to their in service dates  vessels in drydocking  vessels taken out of service for upgrades or prior to their disposition and vessels jointly owned by a third party 
includes activity for only november and december includes activity for the nine vessels acquired from horizon only from december  critical accounting estimates and policies our accounting policies are described in the notes to our audited consolidated and combined financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with gaap 
our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in our financial statements and related notes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  changing capital market conditions and other factors that could affect the ongoing viability of our business and our customers 
we believe the most critical accounting policies in this regard are those described below 
while these issues require us to make judgments that are somewhat subjective  they are generally based on a significant amount of historical data and current market data 
revenue recognition we recognize our revenue according to the type of contract 
most of our revenues are derived from contracts that have a short duration 
these contracts contain either qualified lump sum turnkey provisions or provisions for specific time  material and equipment charges  which we bill in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
we recognize revenue as it is earned at estimated collectible amounts 
revenues generated from specific time  materials and equipment contracts are generally earned on a dayrate basis and recognized as amounts are earned in accordance with contract terms 
under these contracts  we may receive revenues for the mobilization of equipment and personnel  in which case revenues related to mobilization are deferred and recognized over the period during which contracted services for the specific scope of work are performed using the straight line method 
incremental costs incurred directly for mobilization of equipment and personnel to the contracted site  which typically consist of materials  supplies and transit costs  are also deferred and amortized over the period during which contracted services for the specific scope of work are performed using the straight line method 
our policy to amortize the revenues and costs related to mobilization on a straight line basis over the estimated contract service period is consistent with the general pace of activity  level of services being provided and dayrates being earned over the service period of the contract 
mobilization costs to move vessels when a contract does not exist are expensed as incurred 
revenue on significant turnkey contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
in determining whether a contract should be accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we consider whether the customer provides specifications for the construction of facilities or for the provision of related services  we can reasonably estimate our progress towards completion and our costs  the contract includes provisions as to the enforceable rights regarding the goods or services to be provided  consideration to be received and the manner and terms of payment  the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  and we can be expected to perform our contractual obligations 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize estimated contract revenue based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs 
changes in the expected cost of materials and labor  productivity  scheduling and other factors may affect the total estimated costs 
additionally  external factors  including weather or other factors outside of our control  may also affect the progress and estimated cost of a project s completion and  therefore  delay the timing of income and revenue recognition 
we routinely review estimates related to our contracts and reflect revisions to profitability in earnings on a current basis 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates an ultimate loss on a contract  we recognize the projected loss in full when it is first determined as required under gaap 
we recognize additional contract revenue related to claims when the claim is probable and legally enforceab le 
unbilled revenue represents revenue attributable to work that has been completed prior to period end that has not yet been invoiced 
the asset costs in excess of billings represents costs and estimated earnings recognized as revenue on the percentage of completion method in excess of amounts billed as determined on an individual contract basis 
the liability billings in excess of costs represents amounts billed in excess of costs and estimated earnings recognized as revenue on the percentage of completion method on an individual contract basis 
all amounts included in unbilled revenue and costs in excess of billing at december  are expected to be billed and collected within one year 
accounts receivable and allowance for uncollectible accounts accounts receivable are stated at the historical carrying amount  net of write offs and allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
uncollectible accounts receivable are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount that is less than the outstanding historical balance or when we have determined the balance will not be collected 
related party cost allocations helix has provided us certain management and administrative services including internal audit  tax  treasury and other financial services  insurance including claims and related services  information systems  network and communication services  employee benefit services including direct third party group insurance costs and k contribution matching costs discussed below  and corporate facilities management services 
total allocated costs from helix for such services were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
included as a component of these allocations are costs related to the participation by our employees in helix employee benefit plans  including employee medical insurance and a defined contribution k retirement plan  of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in january  the company began paying directly for its own employee medical insurance and k contribution costs and there were no allocations for these costs in these costs have been allocated based on headcount  work hours and revenues  as applicable 
we provide helix operational and field support services including training and quality control services  marine administration services  supply chain and base operation services  environmental  health and safety services  operational facilities management services  and human resources 
total allocated cost to helix for such services were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these costs have been allocated based on headcount  work hours and revenues  as applicable 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
the company depreciates its assets primarily on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
our estimates of useful lives of our assets are as follows vessels to years  portable saturation diving systems  machinery and equipment five to years  and buildings and leasehold improvements four to years 
for long lived assets to be held and used  excluding goodwill  we base our evaluation of recoverability on impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if such impairment indicators are present or other factors exist that indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable  we determine whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flows analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
our marine vessels are assessed on a vessel by vessel basis 
if it is determined that an impairment has occurred  we write down the asset to its fair value and recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or  in the absence of quoted market prices  is based on management s estimate of discounted cash flows the asset will generate in the future 
we recorded no impairment charges in and  and  in  on certain vessels that met the impairment criteria in such charges are included in cost of sales in the accompanying consolidated and combined statements of operations 
the assets impaired in were subsequently sold in and for an aggregate gain on the disposals of approximately  assets are classified as held for sale when we have a plan for disposal of certain assets and those assets meet the held for sale criteria 
at december  we had no assets held for sale  and at december  we classified an asset as held for sale totaling million that was sold in january for its carrying amount 
recertification costs and deferred drydock charges our vessels are required by regulation to be recertified after certain periods of time 
these recertification costs are incurred while the vessel is in drydock 
in addition  routine repairs and maintenance are performed and  at times  major replacements and improvements are performed 
we expense routine repairs and maintenance as they are incurred 
we defer and amortize drydock and related recertification costs over the length of time for which we expect to receive benefits from the drydock and related recertification  which is generally months 
vessels are typically available to earn revenue for the month period between drydock and related recertification processes 
a drydock and related recertification process typically lasts one to two months  a period during which the vessel is not available to earn revenue 
major replacements and improvements  which extend the vessel s economic useful life or functional ope rating capability  are capitalized and depreciated over the vessel s remaining economic useful life 
inherent in this process are estimates we make regarding the specific cost incurred and the period that the incurred cost will benefit 
as of december  and  capitalized deferred drydock charges and related recertification costs included in other long term assets  net totaled million and million  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  drydock amortization expense was million  million and million  respectively 
due to the significant growth of our fleet  we expect drydock amortization expense to increase in future periods 
goodwill and other intangible assets we test for the impairment of goodwill on at least an annual basis 
we test for the impairment of other intangible assets when impairment indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions are present 
our goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value with its carrying amount 
the fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and other market related valuation models 
at december  and  we had goodwill of million and million  respectively  including goodwill of million related to the acquisition of horizon on december  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of november   and none of our goodwill was impaired based on this impairment test 
we will continue to test our goodwill annually on a consistent measurement date unless events occur or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows in thousands balance december  tax and other adjustments balance december  horizon acquisition adjustment tax and other adjustments balance december  a summary of other intangible assets  net  is as follows in thousands as of december  as of december  gross accumulated gross accumulated amount amortization net amount amortization net contract backlog customer relationships non compete agreements trade name total total amortization expenses for intangible assets for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
a summary of the estimated amortization expense for the next five years is as follows in thousands years ended december  equity investment in july  we acquired a minority ownership interest in otsl  a trinidad and tobago entity  in exchange for our dp dsv witch queen 
otsl provides marine contracting services to the oil and gas industry in and around trinidad and tobago 
during the second quarter of  we determined that there was an other than temporary impairment in otsl and the full value of our investment in otsl was impaired

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk management we could be exposed to market risk related to interest rates in the future
