franchise operated and system wide comparable bakery cafe sales percentages are non gaap measures  which should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for other measures of performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  and may not be comparable to system wide comparable bakery cafe sales as defined or used by other companies 
we do not record franchise operated bakery cafe sales as revenues 
however  royalty revenues are calculated based on a percentage of franchise operated bakery cafe sales  as reported by franchisees 
we use franchise operated and system wide sales information internally in connection with store development decisions  planning  and budgeting analyses 
we believe franchise operated and system wide sales information is useful in assessing consumer acceptance of our brand  facilitates an understanding of financial performance and the overall direction and trends of sales and operating income  helps us appreciate the effectiveness of our advertising and marketing initiatives to which our franchisees contribute based on a percentage of their sales  and provides information that is relevant for comparison within the industry 
our revenues are derived from company owned bakery cafe sales  fresh dough sales to franchisees  and franchise royalties and fees 
fresh dough sales to franchisees are primarily the sales of dough products and sales of tuna and cream cheese to certain of our franchisees 
franchise royalties and fees include royalty income and franchise fees 
the cost of food and paper products  labor  occupancy  and other operating expenses relate primarily to company owned bakery cafe sales 
the cost of fresh dough sales relates primarily to the sale of fresh dough products and tuna and cream cheese to franchisees 
general and administrative  depreciation and amortization  and pre opening expenses relate to all areas of revenue generation 
in fiscal  we adopted a new quarterly fiscal calendar whereby each of our quarters include weeks week  week  and week period progressions in each quarter  rather than our prior quarterly fiscal calendar which had weeks in the first quarter and weeks in the second  third  and fourth quarters week period progressions in each quarter 
in fiscal year  we changed our fiscal week to end on tuesday rather than saturday  with our fiscal year ending on the last tuesday in december 
this change allowed us to better serve customers by shifting the weekly closing activities to a less busy day of the week 
as a result  our fiscal year ended on december  instead of december  and  therefore  consisted of fifty two and a half weeks rather than the fifty three week year that would have resulted without the calendar change 
these additional three days in fiscal year did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
as a result of this calendar change  the next fifty three week fiscal year will occur in fiscal year

new stores typically experience an opening honeymoon period whereby they generate higher average weekly sales during the first to weeks they are open as customers settle in to normal usage patterns from initial trial of the location 
on average  the settle in experienced is percent to percent from the average weekly sales during the honeymoon period 
as a result  year over year results of average weekly sales is generally lower than the results in comparable bakery cafe sales 
this results from the relationship of the number of bakery cafes in the honeymoon phase  the number of bakery cafes in the settle in phase  and the number of stores in the comparable store base 
bakery cafe sales for the fiscal year ended december  increased percent to million compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in bakery cafe sales for the fiscal year ended december  compared to the prior fiscal year is primarily due to the impact of a full year s operations of the company owned bakery cafes opened in  the opening of new company owned bakery cafes  the acquisition of bakery cafes from franchisees in  and to a lesser extent the percent increase in comparable company owned bakery cafe sales for the fiscal year ended december  bakery cafe sales were also positively impacted by revenues from the paradise company owned bakery cafes acquired on february  and consolidated into our results prospectively from the acquisition date

bakery cafes included in comparable sales increases and not included in comparable sales increases consisted of percent and percent  respectively  of the million increase in sales from the prior fiscal year 
in addition  average weekly sales for company owned bakery cafes for the fiscal year ended december  decreased as compared to the prior year primarily due to the growth of bakery cafes opened three years or fewer as a percentage of total bakery cafes opened  which experience a slower initial ramp up of average weekly sales  due to lower average weekly sales for bakery cafes opened in  which averaged  for fiscal year driven by the greater concentration of company owned bakery cafe openings in immature markets  and due to lower year over year sales price increases in our company owned bakery cafes in as compared to the average weekly sales per company owned bakery cafe and the related number of operating weeks for the periods indicated are as follows for the fiscal year ended percentage december  december  change company owned average weekly sales company owned number of operating weeks

in  we expect our area developers to open approximately new franchise operated bakery cafes 
the ada requires a franchisee to develop a specified number of bakery cafes on or before specific dates 
if a franchisee fails to develop bakery cafes on schedule  we have the right to terminate the ada and develop company owned locations or develop locations through new area developers in that market 
we may exercise one or more alternative remedies to address defaults by area developers  including not only development defaults  but also defaults in complying with our operating and brand standards and other covenants under the adas and franchise agreements 
fresh dough sales to franchisees for the fiscal year ended december  increased percent to million compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in fresh dough sales to franchisees was primarily driven by the previously described increased number of franchise operated bakery cafes opened and the purchase of one bakery cafe from the company since the prior fiscal year  partially offset by lower overall dough sales resulting from a shift in bakery cafe menu mix away from the bread and bagels we self manufacture in our fresh dough facilities 

table of contents costs and expenses the cost of food and paper products includes the costs associated with the fresh dough operations that sell fresh dough products to company owned bakery cafes  as well as the cost of food and paper products supplied by third party vendors and distributors

partially offsetting these cost pressures was improved leverage of our fresh dough manufacturing costs due to additional bakery cafes opening

labor expense was million  or percent of bakery cafe sales  for the fiscal year ended december  compared to million  or percent of bakery cafe sales  for the fiscal year ended december  the labor expense as a percentage of bakery cafe sales increased between the and fiscal years primarily as a result of the additional labor required in our bakery cafes in support of our evening daypart initiative launched in the third quarter of fiscal year  higher bakery cafe labor in conjunction with the roll out of certain operational improvement initiatives focusing on our lunch daypart  and general inflationary cost pressures  which outpaced the increase in sales prices over the same fiscal years 
occupancy cost was million  or percent of bakery cafe sales  for the fiscal year ended december  compared to million  or percent of bakery cafe sales  for the fiscal year ended december  the increase in occupancy cost as a percentage of bakery cafe sales between the and fiscal years was primarily due to higher average per square foot costs in newer markets outpacing the growth in sales in other operating expenses of million  or percent of bakery cafe sales  for the fiscal year ended december  remained consistent with the fiscal year ended december  of million  or percent of bakery cafe sales

general and administrative expenses was million  or percent of total revenue  for the fiscal year ended december  and million  or percent of total revenue  for the fiscal year ended december  the decrease in the general and administrative expenses rate between the and fiscal years were primarily due to disciplined expense management  leverage from sales growth  and lower incentive bonus expense as a result of weaker corporate performance 
partially offsetting the decrease in the general and administrative expenses rate between the and fiscal years were a million charge incurred in the fourth quarter of for purchase commitments and equipment related to our crispani hand crafted pizza product that panera will no longer utilize as a result of the decision to discontinue this product in the majority of our markets beginning in early other income and expense other income and expense for the fiscal year ended december  decreased to million of expense  or less than percent of total revenue  from million of income  or percent of total revenue  for the fiscal year ended december  the decrease in other income and expense for fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily from lower interest income in resulting from lower cash and investments on hand in  a charge of approximately million in the first quarter of stemming from the paradise acquisition  a charge of approximately million in the second quarter of relating to the termination of franchise agreements for certain acquired franchise operated bakery cafes that operated at a royalty rate lower that the current market royalty rates  and a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of relating to an unrealized loss on our investment in the columbia strategic cash portfolio  or the columbia portfolio  as a result of adverse market conditions that unfavorably affected the fair value and liquidity of collateral underlying the columbia portfolio

our projection of capital expenditures for new company owned bakery cafes reflects our decision to reduce our bakery cafe growth in an effort to focus on our return on invested capital 
our strategy to improve return on invested capital includes raising our sales hurdles for new bakery cafes to adjust to the contraction in margins we have experienced 
we expect to do this by focusing our real estate decision making process to only build bakery cafes that can deliver a percent or greater probability against our revised return on investment goals and bakery cafes that reach mature returns in a shorter amount of time 
as margins improve and the trajectory of our return on invested capital improves  we will once again consider expanding development as appropriate 
we used million of cash flows for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year in fiscal year  we acquired percent of the outstanding stock of paradise  then owner and operator of bakery cafes and one commissary and franchisor of bakery cafes and one commissary  and bakery cafes  as well as two bakery cafes still under construction  from franchisees 
we also made required payments of a portion of the remaining acquisition purchase price for three of our acquisitions in fiscal year as of december   we had a total of million of accrued purchase price affiliated with acquisitions completed in fiscal years and  which is anticipated to be paid within the next twelve months 
in the prior years  we acquired significantly fewer bakery cafes  which included bakery cafes  as well as one bakery cafe still under construction  in fiscal year  and bakery cafes  as well as one bakery cafe still under construction  in fiscal year see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information with respect to our acquisition activity in fiscal years  and historically  we invested a portion of our cash balances on hand in a private placement of units of beneficial interest in the columbia strategic cash portfolio  or columbia portfolio  which is an enhanced cash fund sold as an alternative to traditional money market funds  and we appropriately classified the amounts as trading securities in cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets as the fund was considered both short term and highly liquid in nature 
these investments are subject to credit  liquidity  market and interest rate risk 
for example  the columbia portfolio includes investments in certain asset backed securities and structured investment vehicles that are collateralized by sub prime mortgage securities or related to mortgage securities  among other assets 
as a result of adverse market conditions that have unfavorably affected the fair value and liquidity of collateral underlying the columbia portfolio  the columbia portfolio was overwhelmed with withdrawal requests from investors and it was closed with a restriction placed upon the cash redemption ability of its holders in the fourth quarter of at such time  we reclassified the million of units in the columbia portfolio to short term investments from cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheets  and as an outflow from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
additionally  we assessed the fair value of the underlying collateral for the columbia portfolio through review of current investment ratings  as available  coupled with the evaluation of the liquidation value of assets held by each investment and their subsequent distribution of cash 
we then utilized this assessment of the underlying collateral from multiple indicators of fair value  which were then discounted to reflect the expected timing of disposition and market risks to arrive at an estimated fair value of the columbia portfolio units of per unit as of december  accordingly  we recognized an unrealized loss on the columbia portfolio units of million in the fiscal year ended december  and included the loss in net cash provided by operating activities 
as of december   we have received million of cash redemptions subsequent to the withdrawal restriction  which we classified as investment maturity proceeds provided by investing activities  and recognized million of realized losses 
information and the markets relating to these investments remain dynamic  and there may be further declines in the value of these investments  the value of the collateral held by these entities  and the liquidity of the our investments 
to the extent we determine there is a further decline in fair value  we may recognize additional unrecognized losses in future periods up to the aggregate amount of these investments 
subsequent to our december  fiscal year end and through february   the date of our fiscal year form k filing  we have received additional cash redemptions of million at approximately per unit 
we believe cash redemptions of the remaining units of the columbia portfolio  as included in our accompanying consolidated financial statements at december   will be received within the next twelve months based on the redemptions received to date  however  no commitments on the timing and ability of future redemptions have been made by the columbia portfolio 
during fiscal year  the million of investments in government securities outstanding as of december  matured or were called by the issuer and we did not purchase any additional investments in government securities 
during fiscal year  we purchased million of investments in government securities and million of investments in government securities matured or were called by the issuer 
during fiscal year  we purchased million of investments in government securities and million of these investments in government securities matured or were called by the issuer 
we recognized interest income on investments in government securities of million during fiscal year  million during fiscal year and million during fiscal year this interest income includes premium amortization of million in fiscal year  discount amortization of million in fiscal year  and premium amortization of million in fiscal year  and is classified in other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of operations 
our investments in government securities were classified as short term investments in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and december  based upon their stated maturity dates 

table of contents financing activities financing activities for the fiscal year ended december  included million from borrowings under a credit facility  million from the exercise of stock options  million from the tax benefit from exercise of stock options  million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans  million used to repurchase common stock and million used for debt issuance costs 
financing activities in the fiscal year ended december  included million from the exercise of stock options  million from the tax benefit from exercise of stock options  and million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
the financing activities for the fiscal year ended december  primarily included million from the exercise of stock options and million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
on november   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our class a common stock 
as part of the authorized share repurchase program  we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement with a financial institution  as well as a written trading plan in compliance with rule b under the securities exchange act of  as amended  to purchase up to an aggregate of million of our class a common stock  both of which are subject to maximum per share purchase prices 
during the hedge period in which the number of shares to be purchased under the accelerated share repurchase program was determined  our class a common stock traded at prices above the maximum per share purchase price 
as a result  the accelerated share repurchase program was terminated on december  and no shares were purchased under that program 
however  shares of class a common stock were subsequently repurchased under the rule b plan 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information with respect to our share repurchase programs 
also on november   we entered into a credit agreement with bank of america  na  as administrative agent  and banc of america securities llc 
the credit agreement provides for a million secured facility under which we may select interest rates equal to the base rate which is defined as the higher of the bank of america prime rate and the federal funds rate plus or libor plus an applicable rate  ranging from percent to percent  based on the company s consolidated leverage ratio  as each term is defined in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement allows us on a one time basis prior to february  to request that the credit facility be increased to up to million or such greater amount as may be mutually agreed by us and the administrative agent 
in such an event  banc of america securities llc will use its best efforts to form a syndicate of acceptable lenders to increase the credit facility as requested 
the credit agreement also allows us from time to time to request that the credit facility be further increased by an amount not to exceed  in the aggregate  million  subject to the arrangement of additional commitments with financial institutions acceptable to us  bank of america and existing lenders 
the credit agreement contains various financial covenants that  among other things  require the maintenance of certain leverage and fixed charges coverage ratios 
the credit facility  which is secured by the capital stock of our present and future material subsidiaries  will become due on november   subject to acceleration upon certain specified events of defaults  including breaches of representations or covenants  failure to pay other material indebtedness or a change of control of our company  as defined in the credit agreement 
the proceeds from the credit facility will be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures  permitted acquisitions  and to finance our share repurchase program 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information with respect to the credit facility 
we had a million unsecured revolving line of credit that expired on december  and was not renewed 
as of december   we had a million outstanding letter of credit in support of certain operational activities 
critical accounting policies estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions  which we believe to be reasonable  based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
variances in the estimates or assumptions used could yield materially different accounting results 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the continued appropriateness of our accounting policies and resulting estimates to make adjustments we consider appropriate under the facts and circumstances 

table of contents we have chosen accounting policies we believe are appropriate to report accurately and fairly our operating results and financial position  and we apply those accounting policies in a consistent manner 
we consider our policies on accounting for revenue recognition  goodwill  self insurance  income taxes  lease obligations  and stock based compensation to be the most critical in the preparation of the accompanying consolidated financial statements because they involve the most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
there have been no material changes to our application of critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates since december  revenue recognition we recognize revenue from bakery cafe sales upon delivery of the related food and other products to the customer 
revenue from fresh dough sales to franchisees is also recorded upon delivery of fresh dough to franchisees 
also  a liability is recorded in the period in which a gift card is issued and proceeds are received 
as gift cards are redeemed  this liability is reduced and revenue is recognized as a sale 
further  franchise fees are the result of the sale of area development rights and the sale of individual franchise locations to third parties 
the initial franchise fee is generally  per bakery cafe to be developed under the area development agreement  or ada 
of this fee   is generally paid at the time of signing of the ada and is recognized as revenue when it is received as it is non refundable and we have to perform no other service to earn this fee 
the remainder of the fee is paid at the time an individual franchise agreement is signed and is recognized as revenue upon the opening of the bakery cafe 
royalties are generally paid weekly based on a percentage of sales specified in each ada generally percent to percent of sales 
royalties are recognized as revenue when they are earned 
valuation of goodwill we record goodwill related to the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
at december  and december   our goodwill balance was million and million  respectively 
annually  and whenever an event or circumstance indicates it is more likely than not our goodwill has been impaired  management assesses the carrying value of our recorded goodwill 
we perform our annual impairment assessment on the first day of the fourth quarter of each year by comparing discounted cash flows from reporting units with the carrying value of the underlying net assets inclusive of goodwill 
in performing this analysis  management considers such factors as current results  trends  future prospects and other economic factors 
as of december   the company determined there was no impairment of goodwill 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
self insurance we are self insured for a significant portion of our workers compensation  group health  and general  auto  and property liability insurance with varying levels of deductibles of as much as million of individual claims  depending on the type of claim 
we also purchase aggregate stop loss and or layers of loss insurance in many categories of loss 
we utilize third party actuarial experts estimates of expected losses based on statistical analyses of historical industry data  as well as our own estimates based on our actual historical data to determine required self insurance reserves 
the assumptions are closely reviewed  monitored  and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be affected if actual experience related to the number of claims and cost per claim differs from these assumptions and historical trends 
based on information known at december   we believe we have provided adequate reserves for our self insurance exposure 
as of december  and december   self insurance reserves were million and million  respectively  and were included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
any effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

table of contents in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin no 
fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financials in accordance with sfas no 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this pronouncement also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
effective december   we adopted fin no 
and have applied it to all income tax positions commencing from that date 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin no 
was recorded as an adjustment to reduce the fiscal opening balance of retained earnings in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  we classify estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes as a component of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to fiscal year  we determined our tax contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
we recorded estimated tax liabilities to the extent the contingencies were probable and could be reasonably estimated 
lease obligations we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the reasonably assured lease period 
certain of our lease agreements provide for scheduled rent increases during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy 
we include any rent escalations and construction and other rent holidays in our straight line rent expense 
in addition  we record landlord allowances for non structural tenant improvements as deferred rent  which is included in accrued expenses or deferred rent in the consolidated balance sheets based on their short term or long term nature 
these landlord allowances are amortized over the reasonably assured lease term as a reduction of rent expense 
also  leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related reasonably assured lease term 
stock based compensation we maintain several stock based incentive plans 
we grant options to purchase common stock at an option price equal to the market value of the stock at the date of grant 
options generally vest ratably over a four year period beginning two years from date of grant and have a six year term 
we also grant restricted stock with vesting and terms similar to option grants 
in addition  we offer a stock purchase plan where employees may purchase our common stock each calendar quarter through payroll deductions 
participants in the stock purchase plan may elect to purchase our common stock at percent of market value on the purchase date and we recognize compensation expense on the percent discount 
effective the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  prior periods were not restated 
we use the black scholes option pricing model which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimates  including estimates of the expected term participants will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new stock options and stock options outstanding  but not yet vested  on the date we adopted sfas no 
r 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the fiscal year ended december  totaled approximately million related to stock options  million related to restricted stock  and million related to stock purchase plan discounts 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the fiscal year ended december  totaled approximately million related to stock options  million related to restricted stock  and million related to stock purchase plan discounts 
stock based compensation expense was included in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r  we applied apb no 
 and related interpretations  for our stock option grants 
apb no 
provides that the compensation expense relative to our stock options is measured based on the intrinsic value of the stock option at date of grant 

table of contents contractual obligations and other commitments in addition to our capital expenditure requirements  we have certain other contractual and committed cash obligations 
our contractual cash obligations consist of noncancelable operating leases for our bakery cafes  fresh dough facilities and trucks and administrative offices  purchase obligations primarily for certain commodities  long term debt  and uncertain tax positions 
lease terms for our trucks are generally for six to eight years 
lease terms for our bakery cafes  fresh dough facilities  and administrative offices are generally for ten years with renewal options at most locations and generally require us to pay a proportionate share of real estate taxes  insurance  common area  and other operating costs 
many bakery cafe leases provide for contingent rental ie percentage rent payments based on sales in excess of specified amounts 
certain of our lease agreements provide for scheduled rent increases during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial occupancy 
additionally  in november  we entered into an agreement for a five year credit facility of million 
the new credit facility was used to fund the share repurchases and for general purposes  and is due november  we expect cash expenditures under these lease obligations  purchase obligations  long term debt  and uncertain tax positions to be as follows for the fiscal periods presented payments due by period as of december  in thousands total in after operating leases purchase obligations long term debt uncertain tax positions total see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information

see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information with respect to our uncertain tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements we are the prime tenant for operating leases of franchisee locations and a guarantor for operating leases of locations of our former au bon pain division  or its franchisees 
the leases have terms expiring on various dates from january to december and have a potential amount of future rental payments of approximately million 
the obligation from these leases will continue to decrease over time as these operating leases expire 
we have not recorded a liability for these guarantees pursuant to the provisions of fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
 as of december  and december   as we do not believe it is probable we would be required to perform under any guarantees at those dates 
also  we have not had to make any payments related to the leases 
au bon pain or the applicable franchisee continues to have primary liability for these operating leases 
potential future commitments as of december   for the fiscal periods presented  consist of in thousands total in after subleases and lease guarantees represents aggregate minimum requirement see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 
our percent owned paradise subsidiary has guaranteed operating leases on behalf of its franchisees 
the leases have terms expiring on various dates from october to january and have a potential amount of rental payments of approximately million at december  the obligation from these leases will generally continue to decrease over time as these operating leases expire 
there is no liability reflected for these guarantees pursuant to the provisions of fin no

the applicable franchisee continues to have primary liability for these operating leases 
potential future commitments as of december   for the fiscal periods presented  consist of in thousands total in after lease guarantees represents aggregate minimum requirement see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents we have confidential and proprietary information and non competition agreements agreements with certain employees 
these agreements contain a provision whereby employees would be due a certain number of weeks of their salary if their employment was terminated by us as specified in the agreement 
the company has not recorded a liability for these amounts potentially due employees 
rather  we will record a liability for these amounts when an amount becomes due to an employee in accordance with the appropriate authoritative literature 
as of december   the total amount potentially owed employees under these agreements was approximately million 
impact of inflation our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supply costs 
in the past  we have been able to recover inflationary cost and commodity price increases  including  among other things  gasoline  proteins  dairy  wheat  tuna  and cream cheese costs  through increased menu prices 
there have been  and there may be in the future  delays in implementing such menu price increases  and competitive pressures may limit our ability to recover such cost increases in their entirety 
historically  the effects of inflation on our net income have not been materially adverse 
however  the volatility recently experienced in certain commodity markets  such as those for wheat  which has experienced a significant increase in prices  is expected to have an adverse effect on us in fiscal the extent of the impact will depend on our ability and timing to increase food prices 
a majority of our associates are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
although we have and will continue to attempt to pass along any increased labor costs through food price increases  there can be no assurance that all such increased labor costs can be reflected in our prices or that increased prices will be absorbed by consumers without diminishing to some degree consumer spending at the bakery cafes 
however  we have not experienced to date a significant reduction in bakery cafe profit margins as a result of changes in such laws  and management does not anticipate any related future significant reductions in gross profit margins 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
under sfas no 
 a company may elect to measure eligible financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
if elected  sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our future consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measures 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements  but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently reviewing the impact  if any  that sfas no 
may have on our future consolidated financial statements 
in december the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas no 
r establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statement to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no 
r is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  any business combinations we engage in will be recorded and disclosed following existing gaap beginning december  we expect sfas no 
r will have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when effective  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date 
we are still assessing the impact of this standard on our future consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb sfas no 
changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests 
minority interests will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and will be reported as a component of equity separate from the parent s equity  and purchases or sales of equity interests that do not result in a change in control will be accounted for as equity transactions 
in addition  net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement and upon a loss of control  the interest sold  as well as any interest retained  will be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which will apply retrospectively 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact that the adoption of this statement will have on our future consolidated financial statements 
currently  only our percent interest in paradise would be impacted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we manage our commodity risk in several ways 
on occasion  we have entered into swap agreements to manage our fluctuating butter prices 
all derivative instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes 
as of december   we did not have any derivative instruments 
in addition  we purchase certain commodities  such as flour and coffee  for use in our business 
these commodities are sometimes purchased under agreements of one month to one year time frames usually at a fixed price 
as a result  we are subject to market risk that current market prices may be above or below our contractual price 
we are also exposed to market risk primarily from fluctuations in interest rates on our revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit facility provides for a million secured facility under which we may select interest rates equal to the base rate which is defined as the higher of the bank of america prime rate and the federal funds rate plus or libor 
our borrowings were from a million libor rate loan outstanding under our credit facility at december  a hypothetical one point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of our borrowings at december  would have approximately million pre tax impact on our results of operations 
we intend to expand our operations into canadian markets in  primarily through franchise agreements 
as of december   we had no foreign exchange rate fluctuation risk
