item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of that involve risks and uncertainties  including those set forth in the business risk factors section of this report 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
you should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those financial statements that are included in part iv  item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page executive summary we provide information technology  or it  services including managed hosting  utility computing  colocation  security  network  and professional services through our global infrastructure to businesses and government agencies around the world 
our services are designed to offer a flexible  comprehensive it solution that meets the specific business and infrastructure needs of our customers 
our suite of products can be purchased individually  in various combinations  or as part of a total or partial outsourcing arrangement 
our point solutions meet the specific needs of customers who require control of their physical assets  while our managed hosting solution provides customers with access to our services and infrastructure without the upfront capital costs 
by outsourcing significant elements of their network and it infrastructure needs  our customers are able to focus on their core business while we ensure the performance of their it infrastructure 
we have over  customers across all industries with a particular emphasis in the financial services  media and entertainment  software  and government sectors 
our services although we operate in one operating segment across three geographic locations  we report our revenue by categories of service 
on january   we changed the way we report our revenue to reflect our core service offerings 
we now report revenue in three categories of services hosting services  network services  and other services 
in the second half of  revenue from other services was eliminated primarily due to the sale of our content delivery network cdn assets in january and the migration of moneyline telerate holdings  inc telerate  which was acquired by reuters in  to reuters products and services 
the and amounts reported herein have been reclassified to reflect the new categories of revenue 
accordingly  revenue from reuters  which was previously reported separately in  is now reflected within these three categories of revenue 
hosting services provide the core facilities and network infrastructure to run business applications  provide data storage  and redundancy services 
our hosting services are comprised of colocation and managed hosting 
managed hosting also includes utility computing  colocation  managed security services  and professional services 
our hosting services allow our customers to choose the amount of it infrastructure they prefer to outsource to support their business applications 
customers can scale their use of our services as their own requirements grow and as customers learn the benefits of outsourcing it infrastructure management 
network services are comprised of our managed network services  including managed ip vpn  high speed layer vpn and the services marketed under our wam net brand  hosting area network  and bandwidth services  including tier internet services and bandwidth sold to wholesale customers 
we recently enhanced the performance of our network services by completing the deployment of our application transport network  which provides an enhanced architecture to our network 
this architecture ties together our data centers to facilitate a wide variety of integrated network and hosting solutions  including business continuity and disaster recovery  and ties together our hosting and customer sites into a single ip vpn solution 
other services are comprised of streaming and caching services that we provided pursuant to a reseller agreement that we entered into with level communications  inc level in connection with the sale of our cdn assets and the services that we provided under our contract with telerate  which contract was assigned to reuters in june in connection with reuters acquisition of telerate 
revenue from other services was eliminated in the second half of due to cdn customers having transitioned to level  the completion of the migration of telerate to reuters products  and the reclassification of million of quarterly revenue to network services revenue to reflect the retention of certain network services revenue that we previously expected to be lost 
business trends and outlook our financial results continue to be affected by competition in our industry 
we expect competitive factors in our industry to continue to affect the prices for our services and our results of operations 
price pressures vary by product and service 
prices for certain network services that we offer have decreased over the past several years  and we have seen a decline in the demand for some of our network services in due to increased competition and the introduction of new technology by large telecommunications providers 
while we may continue to see decreases in pricing and demand for some of our network services  there has been some stabilization and increases in pricing and demand of other services that we offer 
we have seen price increases in our colocation services over the past few years and we believe that prices will continue to remain at these levels in areas where there continues to be a high demand for high grade data center space 
in addition  despite the current economic slowdown  we have not experienced a significant change in customer demand for our hosting services 
we completed with encouraging trends as revenue from our managed hosting services grew and revenue from colocation grew compared to we believe that this is partially due to the potential cost savings that we can offer our customers as they outsource their it functions 

table of contents as we enter  we remain cautious about the worldwide economy and continue to explore new opportunities to enhance the services that we offer in order to differentiate our service offerings from those of our competitors 
we intend to focus on the following key areas in increasing the quality of our infrastructure and the reliability of our services and client satisfaction through the continued build out of high grade data center space  improving the efficiencies in our general and administrative areas through process improvement and increasing overall productivity  and continuing to explore strategic options for those services which have experienced relatively slow growth in the past in order to allow us to focus on our high growth services 
we regularly review our revenue  gross profit  gross margin and income loss from operations to evaluate our financial results and overall performance of our business and to assess trends that may affect our business 
the following table presents an overview of these indicators for the periods indicated dollars in thousands years ended december  revenue gross profit gross margin income loss from operations represents revenue less cost of revenue  excluding depreciation  amortization  and accretion  which is reported separately 
represents gross profit  as defined herein  as a percentage of revenue

managed hosting services contributed of total revenue for the year ended december   an increase from for the year ended december  network services revenue was down for the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  the decline in network services revenue was primarily due to decreases in bandwidth services and in managed ip vpn revenue  which was slightly offset by hosting customers that continue to increase their use of our han services for data transport

such improvements were partially offset during the last three quarters of by the sale of our cdn assets in january  and during the last two quarters of  by the sale of certain data center assets in june our gross profit improvement initiatives were also partially offset by incremental operating expenses incurred during the construction of our new data centers  four of which opened in  with additional or expanded data centers scheduled to open in as a result  gross margin was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  
table of contents income from operations income from operations was million for the year ended december   an improvement of million  compared to income from operations of million for the year ended december  the improvement was due to the gain on sale of our cdn assets of million in january  the gain on sale of certain data center assets of million in june  revenue growth of million  and a decrease in cost of revenue of million

in addition  as described further in note in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements contained later in this annual report  we maintain a master lease agreement  under which we acquired million of equipment during the year ended december  the outstanding lease obligations recorded as of december   which is net of interest and the current portion of the lease obligation  were million  compared with million as of december  future minimum lease payments due under capital and financing method lease obligations  as of december   were million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and million thereafter  all of which represent interest using the effective interest method 
equity transactions stock options 
during  we granted million stock options under our amended and restated incentive compensation plan plan  with a total compensation expense of million to be recognized over the vesting period  using the black scholes option pricing model 
compensation expense associated with stock options was million  million  and million in the years ended december    and  respectively 
our expense includes million associated with the modification of a term of a former executive s stock option agreement in march secondary stock offering 
on january   mlt llc  which owned million  or  of the outstanding shares of our common stock at december   sold all such shares under our existing shelf registration statement 
we did not receive any of the proceeds of the offering 
commitments and contingencies our customer contracts generally span multiple periods  which results in us entering into arrangements with various suppliers of communications services that require us to maintain minimum spending levels  some of which increase over time  to secure favorable pricing terms 
our remaining aggregate minimum spending levels  allocated ratably over the terms of such contracts  are million  million  million  million  million  and million during the years ended december       and thereafter  respectively 
should we not meet the minimum spending levels in any given term  decreasing termination liabilities  representing a percentage of the remaining contractual amounts  may become immediately due and payable 
furthermore  certain of these termination liabilities are potentially subject to reduction should we experience the loss of a major customer or suffer a loss of revenue from a general economic downturn 
before considering the effects of any potential reductions for the business downturn provisions  if we had terminated all of these agreements as of december   the maximum liability would have been million 
to mitigate this exposure  when possible  we align our minimum spending commitments with customer revenue commitments for related services 
in the normal course of business  we are a party to certain guarantees and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk as they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  such as letters of credit  indemnifications  and operating leases  under which the majority of our facilities are leased 
the agreements associated with such guarantees and financial instruments mature at various dates through december  and may be renewed as circumstances warrant 
our financial instruments are valued based on the estimated amount of exposure and the 
table of contents likelihood of performance being required 
based on our past experience  no claims have been made against these financial instruments nor do we expect the exposure to material losses resulting therefrom to be anything other than remote 
as a result  we determined such financial instruments did not have significant value and have not recorded any related amounts in our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had million in letters of credit outstanding under the revolving facility  pledged as collateral to support certain facility leases and utility agreements 
also  in connection with the sale of our cdn assets  we agreed to indemnify the purchaser should it incur certain losses due to a breach of our representations and warranties 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and actions arising in the normal course of our business 
while the results of all such proceedings and actions cannot be predicted  management believes  based on facts known to management today  that the ultimate outcome of all such proceedings and actions will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operation  or cash flows 
one such action in which we are the defendant is an action brought by sitelite holdings  inc  or sitelite  in the superior court of california  county of orange 
sitelite alleges several business torts and statutory violations related to a contractual relationship with us that we terminated in  including defamation and false advertising  theft of intellectual property and trade secrets  and breach of contract 
sitelite contends that these alleged actions led to a loss of customers  and ultimately  to its bankruptcy 
sitelite seeks million and punitive damages 
the litigation is currently in the discovery phase 
while no assurances of the outcome of litigation can be provided  we have denied liability and intend to continue to vigorously defend our interests 
in january  the court set a trial date for september  we have employment agreements with key executive officers that contain provisions with regard to base salary  bonus  equity based compensation  and other employee benefits 
these agreements also provide for severance benefits in the event of employment termination or a change in control

critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
for a detailed description on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
note that our preparation of this annual report requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we derive the majority of our revenue from recurring revenue streams  consisting primarily of hosting  which includes managed hosting and colocation  and network services  which is recognized as services are provided 
installation fees  although generally billed upon installation  are deferred and recognized ratably over the life of the customer contract 
revenue is recognized when the related service has been provided  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
in addition  we have service level commitments pursuant to individual customer contracts with a majority of our customers 
to the extent that such service levels are not achieved  or are otherwise disputed due to third party power or service issues  unfavorable weather  or other service interruptions or conditions  we estimate the amount of credits to be issued and record a reduction to revenue  with a corresponding increase in the allowance for credits and uncollectibles 
in the event that we provide credits or payments to customers related to service level claims  we may request recovery of such costs through third party insurance agreements 
insurance proceeds received under these agreements are recorded as an offset to previously recorded revenue reductions 

table of contents allowance for credits and uncollectibles as previously described herein  we have service level commitments with certain of our customers 
to the extent that such service levels are not achieved  we estimate the amount of credits to be issued  based on historical credits issued and known disputes  and record a reduction to revenue  with a corresponding increase in the allowance for credits and uncollectibles 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including customer payment history and creditworthiness 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers although in certain cases we may obtain a security deposit 
when evaluating the adequacy of allowances  we maintain an allowance for uncollectibles and specifically analyze accounts receivable  current economic conditions and trends  historical bad debt write offs  customer concentrations  customer payment history and creditworthiness  and changes in customer payment terms 
delinquent account balances are charged to expense after we have determined that the likelihood of collection is not probable 
equity based compensation we recognize equity based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment 
the fair value of total equity based compensation for stock options and restricted preferred units is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model which utilizes certain assumptions and estimates that have a material impact on the amount of total compensation cost recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
total equity based compensation costs for restricted stock units and restricted stock awards are calculated based on the market value of the stock on the date of grant 
total equity based compensation is amortized to non cash equity based compensation expense over the vesting or performance period of the award  as applicable  which typically ranges from three to four years 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value techniques to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also provides for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
the standard applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   with early adoption permitted 
adoption of sfas did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits entities to elect to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with early adoption permitted 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in august  the fasb issued an exposure draft of proposed fasb staff position apb a the proposed fsp which would change the accounting for our convertible notes 
under the proposed new rules  for convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion  an entity should separately account for the liability and equity components of the instruments to reflect the issuer s economic interest cost 
adoption of the proposed fsp would require the reclassification of approximately million from long term debt to additional paid in capital which would be treated as original issue discount of the convertible notes 
higher interest expense would result by recognizing the accretion of the discounted carrying value of the convertible notes to their face amount as interest expense over the term of the convertible notes 
we believe the fasb plans to issue final guidance in the first half of calendar  with an effective date as early as our fiscal year ended under the proposed fsp  early adoption would not be permitted and the new rules would be applied retrospectively to all periods presented 
while the proposed fsp does not change the economic substance or cash flow requirements of the convertible notes  our interest expense could increase by approximately million per year 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations 
sfas r amends sfas and provides revised guidance for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired  liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
it also provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
it is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and will be applied prospectively to future acquisitions 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas r will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb sfas requires that ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  and the amount of consolidated net income  be clearly identified  labeled  and presented in the consolidated financial statements 
it also requires  once a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value 
sufficient disclosures are required to clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
it is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests 
all other requirements will be applied prospectively 
we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows
