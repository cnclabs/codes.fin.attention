table of contents and administrative related to nonrefundable deposits made towards the purchase and costs incurred during the company s due diligence efforts  in the first quarter of  we suspended sales and production of the commercial treadclimber and retired certain commercial grade elliptical trainers due to quality and reliability issues resulting in pretax charges of million charged to cost of goods sold in  we stopped or delayed development of certain products which resulted in intellectual property impairment charges in the amount of million charged to operating expenses  we exited certain marketing contracts  resulting in a million charge to operating expenses  and we restructured staff to address declining revenues  terminated the former chief executive officer and incurred fees recruiting for a new chief executive  resulting in a million charge to operating expenses 
for the year  we delivered net sales from continuing operations of million compared to million in  a decrease of 
gross profit margins decreased to in compared to in the largest contributor to our decrease in gross margins in was a million charge recorded for warranty and inventory reserves related to quality issues and the decision to stop selling certain of our commercial cardiovascular products until quality issues can be remedied 
operating expenses were million in compared to million in the prior year  an increase of 
this increase is primarily the result of million of significant charges incurred in connection with strategic decisions made by management in an effort to return the company to profitability  offset by an million lawsuit settlement in which the company received the rights to utilize a variety of fitness equipment patents and related technologies

the decrease is a result of decreases in the retail and direct channels in the fitness equipment business offset by an increase in sales in the international equipment business 
fitness equipment business the fitness equipment business designs  produces  markets and sells fitness products under the nautilus  bowflex  schwinn fitness  and stairmaster brand names 
depending on the brand  our fitness equipment is marketed and sold through the direct  commercial  and retail channels of distribution located in north and south america 
net sales for the fitness equipment business were million in as compared to million last year  a decrease of million or 
specific channel net sales information is detailed below in the direct channel  net sales declined to million in compared to million last year 
sales in the direct channel consist of our bowflex branded products and primarily include our rod based home gyms  treadclimber products  bowflex revolution and selecttech dumbbells 
the decrease in net sales is primarily due to a decrease in sales of rod based home gyms 
the decrease in sales of rod based home gyms resulted primarily from of reduced advertising for rod based home gyms and a higher number of similar power rod products being sold at our retail partner locations during during we experienced increased advertising costs which led to fewer ads being purchased for the same dollars due to increased competition for 
table of contents advertising space 
the decrease in sales of rod based home gyms was slightly offset by an increase in sales volume for our bowflex revolution and the bowflex treadclimbers 
sales of these products increased as a result of increased advertising and the introduction during of the revo xp with an upright bench format 
in the retail channel  net sales declined to million as compared to million last year 
the decline in this channel was mainly due to a shift in strategy as we are limiting the number of power rod home gyms being offered into this channel to more clearly differentiate and segment products by channel 
the retail channel experienced a general softness in consumer spending during which has caused the company to provide a greater level of support to its customers in the form of discounts to allow our customers to sell through their existing inventory 
in the commercial channel  net sales remained substantially unchanged at million in compared to million last year 
product features of nautilus branded bikes were refreshed during which led to significant increases in sales volumes for those products 
we also experienced increased sales of the treadclimber product and stairmaster stepping products 
this was offset by decreased sales of schwinn branded indoor bikes  other nautilus branded cardio equipment and a slight decline in sales of the strength product lines as a result of delays in production and delivery of the company s newly launched nautilus one and certain free weight product lines 
sales of the company s commercial treadclimber products were suspended in early as a result of durability issues 
sales will be suspended until the product can be re engineered and the durability and warranty issues can be corrected 
we anticipate this will lead to a reduction in commercial channel revenue during compared with royalty income represents the revenue the company receives for licensing certain owned patents  trademarks and brands to other companies 
royalty income increased to million in compared to million last year 
the increase was a result of acquiring a large patent group related to elliptical machines during on which the company had previously paid royalties 
the acquisition of the patent group allowed the company to begin collecting royalty income from other parties who use the licensed technology 
international equipment business the international equipment business markets and sells fitness products sold under the nautilus  bowflex  schwinn fitness  and stairmaster  brand names through the commercial  retail and direct channels of distribution located outside of the americas 
net sales for the international equipment business improved to million as compared to million last year 
the increase in net sales was due to expansion of our commercial sales channel in our four western european subsidiaries  as well as increased sales through our distributors following the introduction of the treadclimber in international sales markets 
in addition  we established a subsidiary in china during the third quarter of and added a direct division in australia during the direct australia division added million in sales during the direct australia division was closed in early and the market will be supported through the traditional distributor model business going forward 
sales of the company s commercial treadclimber products were suspended in early as a result of durability issues 
sales will be suspended until the product can be re engineered and the durability issues can be corrected 
we anticipate this to cause a reduction in international equipment business revenue during compared with gross profit as a result of our decline in sales  our total gross profit declined by to million in as compared to million last year 
as a percentage of consolidated net sales from continuing operations our gross profit margin decreased to as compared to last year 
the decrease in gross profit margin was due primarily to charges incurred during of million resulting from warranty and inventory reserves related to commercial cardiovascular products 
this change impacted margin by percentage points 
gross profit margin also decreased as a result of the continued shift in our sales product mix both between and within product categories and among our selling channels 
during  the company reclassified royalty expense into cost of goods sold for all reporting periods 
royalties were previously reported as a separate line item included in operating expenses 

table of contents fitness equipment business gross profit for our fitness equipment business declined to million in as compared to million last year 
as a percentage of net sales  the gross profit margin declined to in compared to last year 
factors affecting gross profit included significant charges related to warranty and inventory write offs resulting from suspension of sales of the commercial treadclimber product and a commercial elliptical product 
other factors affecting gross profit margin include sales channel and product sales mix and additional promotions in the direct and retail channels 
most notable is the reduction of sales in power rod home gyms sold in both the direct and retail channels that historically provide higher margins than most of our other finished goods 
during the company s gross margins benefited from rebates payable under our supply agreement with land america 
as a result of the termination of the agreement to purchase the land america assets  those rebates will not be available in the negative impact on gross margins resulting from termination of the rebates will depend on the volume of purchases from land america 
during  the company reclassified royalty expense related to products sold into cost of goods sold 
royalty expense was previously reported as a separate line within operating expenses for those products utilizing a licensed patented technology 
the reclassification was made for all periods presented 
royalty expense of and million for the years ended december  and  respectively is included in gross profit 
international equipment business gross profit for our international equipment business was million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of net sales  the gross profit margin increased to in compared to in the increased gross profit is the result of a better sales mix in the retail channel and improved margins due to the inclusion of some direct sales in china and australia 
the company closed the australia direct business in early because of lack of overall profitability in that channel 
operating expenses selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses increased by million or to in as compared to million last year 
as a percentage of consolidated net sales our selling and marketing expenses increased to in compared to last year 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses in the fitness equipment business related to incremental bad debt reserves of million primarily resulting from the bankruptcy filing by a former customer and a million charge to exit certain marketing contracts 
in addition  selling and marketing expenses within the international equipment business increased in support of growing revenue  and as a result of costs related to expansion into new markets including china and australia 
these increases were offset by a sales volume decline in the direct channel resulting in lower marketing expenses and financing fees within the fitness equipment business 
as a percentage of sales  selling and marketing expenses in the direct channel increased during general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by million or to million in as compared to million last year 
the increase was primarily a result of the following i a million charge related to termination of the land america asset purchase agreements  ii a million intellectual property impairment related to strategic changes in the company s plans to utilize the patents acquired in the second quarter of  iii million of additional expenses incurred in connection with the december  special shareholder meeting  iv million in costs associated with the departure of the company s former ceo  and v other increases in recruiting and salaries as new members were added to the management team 
research and development research and development expenses increased by million or to million in as compared to million in the increase was due to an increase in wages  recruiting and prototyping expenses for our research and development efforts related to the introduction of the nautilus one and other new products during the year 

table of contents during  the company reclassified preproduction royalties into research and development expenses for all periods presented which added million and million for and  respectively 
preproduction royalties represent costs paid to utilize licensed patent technologies prior to the completion of a finished product 
the increase in preproduction royalties over the prior year is related to the license of specific patents related to the development of new products 
litigation settlement during  the company settled a lawsuit with icon health and fitness  inc and as a result we received the rights to utilize a variety of fitness equipment related patents and technologies 
we valued those assets and recorded them in litigation settlement as a reduction in operating expenses of million 
the company recorded an impairment charge of million in general and administrative expense during as changes were made to the plans to utilize the patents and technologies received 
other income expense interest expense interest expense increased to million in compared to interest expense of million in the increase in interest expense is due to the increased average short term borrowings outstanding during as compared to other income  net other income  net remained consistent with at approximately million for both periods 
other income is a result of foreign currency gains recognized by the company due to fluctuations in local currencies in which the company operates 
income tax expense benefit the provision for income tax expense was a benefit of million during as compared to an expense of million last year 
this change was due to a pre tax loss in compared to pre tax income in our effective tax rate in was compared to in the increase in our annual effective rate was primarily due to the change to pre tax loss from pre tax income in and the reduction of tax contingency reserves in discontinued operations the company designated the financial results of the fitness apparel business as discontinued operations during this resulted in recording the financial results as gain loss from discontinued operations 
the loss from discontinued operations during was million compared to gain from discontinued operations of million during the prior year 
the loss from discontinued operations includes an impairment charge of million for the difference between book value of the fitness apparel business net assets and the anticipated net sale proceeds 
comparison of the years ended december  and december  all assets and liabilities and results of operations associated with the fitness apparel business assets have been presented in the consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations separate from continuing operations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

the decrease in net sales was due to a combination of reduced advertising earlier in as a result of increased competition for media space and lower conversion rates as consumer confidence was negatively affected by higher interest rates and increasing fuel prices resulting in an overall decrease in sales of our rod based home gyms 
this decrease was slightly offset by an increase in sales volume for our bowflex treadclimbers and the bowflex revolution  our latest generation of bowflex home gyms 
in the commercial channel  net sales in were million compared to million in during we made a decision to renegotiate terms and discounts with our commercial dealers in order to increase overall profitability within the channel 
as a result of these negotiations we realized a slight reduction in commercial dealer sales volumes 
this decrease was offset by realizing a full year of sales from the nautilus commercial grade treadclimber  various new product introductions during the last half of  and a four percent price increase that was issued on a variety of products mid year 
in the retail channel  net sales increased in to million as compared to million in growth in the channel was mainly due to an increase in sales volume through our existing retail partners which resulted in additional sales for our bowflex rod based home gyms  selecttech dumbbells  and the bowflex blaze home gym  which was launched in the third quarter of contributing further to the growth was the realization of a full year of sales from products introduced later in for our schwinn fitness line of cardio equipment 
the overall increase was offset by a decrease in sales of our bowflex treadclimbers  nautilus strength products  and the discontinued trimline cardio products 
during the year  we also revised our supply chain strategy to increase the number of shipments to our retail customers directly from our asian manufacturing partners 
while this contributed to a reduction in net sales during the year  our profitability increased due to decreased distribution  freight and the us customs related costs 
the channel also realized a slight decrease from the negative effect of poor sell through in the last quarter of in our specialty retail customer base that resulted primarily from an increasingly competitive market for specialty products and an increasingly challenging specialty retail environment 
international equipment business net sales for the international equipment business improved in to million as compared to million in the increase in net sales is a result of the growth of sales to the international distributor network which contributed approximately million  and additional sales in china and the western european countries of million and million  respectively 
consolidated gross profit as a result of our increased sales  our total gross profit increased by to million in as compared to million in as a percentage of consolidated net sales our gross profit margin decreased to as compared to last year 
the decrease was a result of the continued shift in our sales product mix both between and within product categories and among our selling channels 
this was partially offset by a reduction in our warranty costs primarily through a recovery of a portion of such costs from our suppliers 
in addition  as a result of improving our operating efficiencies and sustained engineering efforts we have continued to focus on reducing the cost of our sourced products from our asian manufacturers

in addition  we realized reductions in the actual cost of our sourced products through various sustained engineering efforts and continued vendor contract negotiations as we seek strong partnerships with fewer vendors 
these cost savings were offset by an increase in freight costs and changes in both the sales channel and product sales mix within the product categories 
international equipment business gross profit for our international equipment business was million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
as a percentage of net sales  the gross profit margin decreased to in from in the decrease as a percentage of sales is a result of increased royalties in due to the mix of products sold that incur a royalty 
the increased gross profit was attributed to efficiency gains in service and logistics performance along with an overall increase in sales volume 
the increase was offset by downward pressure on selling prices exerted by strong competition  increased freight costs  and unfavorable sales mix resulting in increased sales volumes from the lower margin retail sales channel 
consolidated operating expenses selling and marketing selling and marketing s m expenses remained flat in at million as compared to million in as a percentage of consolidated net sales our s m expenses decreased to in compared to in the increase in total s m expenses was primarily due to an increase in consumer financing fees due to stronger financing utilization by our direct channel consumers  an increase in direct marketing costs and additional share based compensation expense of approximately million as a result of adoption of sfas r

discontinued operations in the company designated the financial results of the fitness apparel business as discontinued operations 
this resulted in recording the financial results from these operations as gain from discontinued operations 
the gain from discontinued operations during was million compared to million during the increase in gain from discontinued operations in was due to the acquisition of pearl izumi occurring in july which resulted in a gain from discontinued operations for six months in compared to twelve months of operations during liquidity and capital resources during  our operating activities from continuing operations provided million in net cash compared to providing net cash of million in the reduction in operating cash provided from continuing operations year over year was primarily due to a reduction in net sales resulting in a loss from continuing operations of million offset by a reduction in trade receivables of million

our fitness apparel business primarily consists of pearl izumi which designs  markets and sells branded fitness apparel and footwear sold primarily under the pearl izumi brand globally 
in february the company entered into an agreement to sell pearl izumi and the company anticipates the sale to be completed late 
table of contents in the first quarter of accordingly  the results of operations for the fitness apparel business have been reclassified as discontinued operations 
net cash provided by operating activities of discontinued operations during was million compared to net cash used by discontinued operations of million in the significant increase is a result of recording an impairment charge of million to adjust the net book value of the fitness apparel business down to fair market value as determined by an accepted sale agreement 
cash flows used in investing activities for discontinued operations were million in compared to million in cash flows used in financing activities for discontinued operations were million in compared to million in as the company made debt payments related to the original acquisition 
the company expects the sale to be completed in the first quarter of and the net cash proceeds of approximately million will be used to reduce the company s borrowings under its short term borrowings 
the following table presents our estimated contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations short term borrowings total included in the operating lease total is million of lease obligations related to facilities that will be closed during given that the majority of our inventory is sourced from asia  we have long lead times for inventory purchases and therefore need to secure factory capacity from our vendors in advance 
as the result  all of the million in purchase obligations is for inventory purchases 
this inventory is predominately related to sales anticipated in the first half of due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
off balance sheet arrangements as described in note to the consolidated financial statements located at item of this form k  from time to time  we arrange for leases or other financing sources with third parties to enable certain of our commercial customers to purchase our commercial products 
while most of these financings are without recourse  in certain cases we may offer a guarantee or other recourse provisions 
at december  and december   the maximum contingent liability under all recourse provisions was approximately million and million  respectively 
the company has an agreement with a financing company to provide second tier financing for its consumers under which the company previously shared financial responsibility if consumer default rates exceeded contractual expectations 
during the third quarter  the company renegotiated its second tier financing agreements and transferred risk of loss to the financing company for a settlement payment of million 
as a result  a reserve is no longer established for consumer default on second tier financing arrangements 
our financing partners review consumer credit information and determine which consumers will receive financing and approve the amount of financing provided 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these arrangements 

table of contents inflation and price changes we are experiencing cost increases for products and components manufactured in china reflecting increases in foreign currency exchange rates  and chinese wages  taxes and raw material costs which our third party sourcing partners are seeking to pass along to the company 
raw material costs have also increased for products manufactured by nautilus owned facilities in the united states 
gross margins may be negatively impacted if these conditions continue and the company is unable to find other cost savings opportunities or increase prices enough to offset the cost increases 
during both and  we experienced increases in transportation costs due to increases in the price for fuel 
to the extent these costs continue to increase and we are unable to pass these costs to the customer  our gross margins may continue to be negatively impacted 
seasonality in general  based on historic trends  we expect our sales from fitness equipment products both in the us and internationally to vary seasonally with sales typically the strongest in the fourth quarter  followed by the first and third quarters  and the weakest in the second quarter 
we believe that such factors as the broadcast of national network season finales and seasonal weather patterns influence television viewership and cause our television commercials on national cable television to be less effective in the second quarter than in other periods of the year 
in addition  during the spring and summer consumers tend to do more activities outside including exercise  which impacts sales of fitness equipment used indoors 
we expect the fluctuation in our net sales between our highest and lowest quarters to be approximately 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
as described by the securities and exchange commission sec  critical accounting estimates and assumptions are those that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on the financial condition or operating performance of the company 
based on this definition  we believe the items listed below are our critical accounting estimates and assumptions 
management and our independent auditors regularly discuss with our audit committee each of our critical accounting estimates and assumptions  as well as critical accounting policies presented in note to the consolidated financial statements located at item of this form k  and the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the disclosure about each estimate in the md a 
these discussions typically occur at our quarterly audit committee meetings and include the basis and methodology used in developing and selecting these estimates  the trends in and amounts of these estimates  specific matters affecting the amount of and changes in these estimates  and any other relevant matters related to these estimates  including significant issues concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when products are shipped and we have no significant remaining obligations  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured or probable  and title and risk of loss have passed 
revenue is recognized net of applicable promotional discounts  rebates  and return allowances  some of which need to be estimated at the time we recognize revenue 
in addition  revenue is recognized upon final installation for the nautilus commercial equipment if we are 
table of contents responsible for installation 
return allowances  which reduce product revenue by our best estimate of expected product returns  are estimated using historical experience 
in addition  from time to time  we arrange for leases or other financing sources to enable certain of our commercial customers to purchase our equipment 
in the event that a guarantee of the commercial customer s lease obligation is made  we record a liability and corresponding reduction of revenue for the estimated fair value of the guarantee and then recognize that revenue over the life of the lease obligation  unless a loss is actually incurred related to such guarantee 
we recognize estimated losses as they become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained at a level based on our historical experience adjusted for any known uncollectible amounts 
we periodically review the creditworthiness of our customers to help gauge collectibility 
our allowance is sensitive to changes in our customers ability to pay due to unforeseen changes in the economy  the bankruptcy of a major customer  our efforts to actively pursue collections  and increases in chargebacks 
any major change in the aforementioned factors may result in increasing the allowance for doubtful accounts  which could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
inventory valuation our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
inventory adjustments are applied for any known obsolete or defective products 
we periodically review inventory levels of our product lines in conjunction with market trends to assess salability of our products 
our assessment of necessary adjustments to market value of inventory is sensitive to changes in fitness technology and competitor product offerings driven by customer demand 
any major change in the aforementioned factors may result in reductions to market value of inventory below cost  which could have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
product warranty we provide a limited warranty for the replacement of defective products 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective products at no cost to the consumer 
we estimate the costs that may be incurred under our basic limited warranty and record a liability in the amount of such costs at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold  along with the historical and anticipated cost to repair  replace or refund the original sale 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
a significant change is our estimates may have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in early  the company suspended sales of the commercial treadclimber products as a result of product durability issues until those issues can be corrected 
the severity of the quality issues and costs related to either replacing or maintaining this product increased significantly during the fourth quarter of leading management to take specific action with this product 
management is currently evaluating alternatives for addressing this warranty issue and has recorded its best estimate of the cost to remediate the issues identified which is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities 
stock compensation we account for employee share based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment 
the fair value of each equity award as well as determination of probability when performance targets for awards subject to performance conditions are expected to be met require extensive use of judgment 
application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different amounts of compensation cost recognized in the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents litigation and loss contingencies from time to time  we may be involved in various claims  lawsuits and other proceedings 
such litigation involves uncertainty as to possible losses we may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
we record any such possible losses in accordance with us gaap 
the company estimates the probability of losses on legal contingencies based on the advice of internal and external counsel  the outcomes from similar litigation  the status of the lawsuits including settlement initiatives  legislative developments  and other factors 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  may change our estimates significantly 
a significant change in our estimates  or a result that materially differs from our estimates  may have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
goodwill and intangible assets valuation we evaluate our intangible assets and goodwill for potential impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on anticipated cash flows  market conditions  regulatory and other factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss may reduce our net worth and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   goodwill and intangible assets represented of our total assets 
as a result of the decision to exit the business  the company determined the goodwill for pearl izumi was impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million in loss from discontinued operations during the impairment was calculated based on an offer of million to purchase the business 
due to the decision to not pursue certain product innovations  the company determined certain of the intangible assets obtained from the legal settlement during the second quarter of were impaired during the fourth quarter and recorded as impairment charge of million in general and administrative expenses in income tax provision income taxes are accounted for under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
inherent in the measurement of these deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of existing tax law and other published guidance as applied to our operations
