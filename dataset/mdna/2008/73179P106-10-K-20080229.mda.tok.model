recent developments sale of businesses and discontinued operations in july  we sold our interest in oxy vinyls lp oxyvinyls for million in cash 
during the second quarter of an impairment of million was recorded on our investment in oxyvinyls due to an other than temporary decline in value 
this sale resulted in the reversal of an associated deferred tax liability  which reduced tax expense by million for the year ended december  proceeds from the sale were used for the redemption of the balance of our senior notes as well as for the reduction of borrowings under short term facilities 
the redemption of the senior notes resulted in debt redemption premium costs and the write off of unamortized debt issuance fees for of million million after tax 
unless otherwise noted  disclosures contained in this annual report on form k relate to continuing operations 
for more information about our discontinued operations  see note b to the consolidated financial statements 
purchase of businesses in january  we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of gls corporation  a global provider of specialty thermoplastic elastomer compounds for consumer  packaging and medical applications 
in december  we acquired the vinyl compounding business and assets of ngai hing plastchem company ltd 
nhpc  a subsidiary of ngai hing hong company limited for million  net of cash received 
in a transaction related to the sale of our interest in oxyvinyls  in july  we purchased the remaining minority interest in powder blends  lp for million in cash 
restructuring initiatives and facility closures during the third quarter of  we announced the closure of two manufacturing lines at our avon lake  ohio facility 
the transition was completed in the fourth quarter of and resulted in expenses related to employee separation and plant phaseout charges of million 
during  we recognized and paid million in employee separation charges related to employees involved in the restructuring of our manufacturing facility in st 
peters  missouri  part of the north american color and additives operating segment 
in  we recognized charges of million related to three executive severance agreements 
the closure and exit from the company s commerce  california facility was completed in the first quarter of  resulting in employee separation charges and plant phaseout charges of million 
sale of assets as part of our restructuring initiatives and cost reduction plans  during  we sold previously closed facilities and other assets for proceeds of million and collected million in cash related to assets sold in environmental remediation costs in september  we were informed of rulings by the united states district court for the western district of kentucky on several pending motions in the case of westlake vinyls  inc v 
goodrich corporation  et al  which has been pending since the court held that we must pay the remediation costs at the former goodrich corporation now westlake vinyls  inc calvert city facility  together with certain defense costs of goodrich corporation 
the rulings also provided that we can seek indemnification for contamination attributable to westlake vinyls 
we recorded a charge of million and made payments  net of related receipts of million  in for past remediation activities related to these court rulings 
we also adjusted our environmental reserve for future remediation costs  a portion of which already related to the calvert city site  resulting in a charge of million in see note n to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
results of operations summary of consolidated results aggregate sales increased in compared to this increase was primarily due to sales growth in asia  higher prices driven by value adding selling activities of our commercial team to offset higher raw material and energy costs  and the impact of favorable exchange rates 
foreign exchange had a favorable effect on sales 
within all other north american engineered materials  producer services and the specialty inks and polymer systems operating segments all registered sales growth in versus  which offset a decline in sales in the north polyone corporation american color and additives business due mainly to the pruning of low margin business 
these items netted positively against the million  or  decline in sales in our vinyl business segment  mainly resulting from the slowdown in the residential construction market  and the decrease in year over year shipments 
income before discontinued operations declined million in  or per share  compared to income from continuing operations before income taxes declined million in compared to a table showing material items that comprise this decline is provided after the following table which sets forth key financial information from our statements of income for the years ended december   and  respectively

see the following operating segment discussion for a further explanation of our segments operating results for the periods shown in the preceding table 
selected operating costs selected operating costs  expressed as a percentage of sales  are as follows cost of sales selling and administrative costs cost of sales these costs include raw materials  plant conversion and distribution charges 
as a percentage of sales  these costs increased in compared to primarily due to higher raw material costs not yet fully offset by price increases largely associated with the vinyl business and as a result of environmental remediation costs at inactive or formerly owned sites 
for the year ended december   environmental related remediation costs were million as compared to million in see recent developments section 
the increased environmental remediation costs more than offset the declines in cost of sales on a percent basis being realized from the implementation of our specialization strategy 
as a percentage of sales  these costs declined in compared to primarily from the full year effect of efforts to increase our selling prices to pass on higher raw material  distribution and utility costs  as well as the effect of our specialization strategy to increase new higher value business 
selling and administrative these costs generally include selling  technology and general and administrative charges 
selling and administrative costs increased or million in as compared to in  selling and administrative costs had a million benefit from insurance  legal settlements and adjustments to related reserves 
the remainder of the change in selling and administrative expense was due mainly to increased investment in commercial resources and capabilities  partially offset by lower incentive  pension and post retirement benefit costs 
selling and administrative costs increased in compared to from higher share based compensation and incentive costs and increased investment in commercial resources and capabilities  partially offset by a higher benefit in than from legal and other related settlements 
other components of income and expense following are discussions of significant components of income and expense that are presented below the line operating income

these costs are included in corporate and eliminations 
vinyl business vinyl business sales were million in  million or lower than the primary driver was the slowdown in the residential building and construction market  which affected demand for vinyl windows  pipe and fittings products  pvc flooring and appliances 
also  negatively affecting results was a growing presence of imported products in the end markets that use or that compete directly with our specialty resin product 
shipments in were down versus operating income in decreased million or compared to the primary drivers of this decline were weak polyone corporation residential construction demand and margin compression due to the combination of downward pricing pressure in residential building and construction end markets and higher raw material and energy costs 
international color and engineered materials international color and engineered materials sales increased million  or  to million due primarily to strong growth in our color and additives businesses in asia and europe  favorable foreign exchange and modest growth in specialty engineered materials product lines in europe 
asian sales across all product platforms grew while europe demonstrated sales growth of 
favorable foreign exchange rates increased international color and engineered materials sales by million  or 
in asia  colorant and additives sales grew  particularly in specialty packaging applications utilizing liquid color product technology 
our asian engineered materials business demonstrated sales growth of in versus despite a second half slowdown in the growth of the electrical electronics market 
operating income increased million in as compared to this increase was driven by improved margins due to greater penetration of specialty applications in the asian and european color and additive businesses  higher margins due to product mix improvements  value selling and price management and lower conversion costs 
foreign exchange had a favorable impact on operating income of million 
polyone distribution distribution sales increased million  or  as compared to due to relatively flat shipment volume combined with a increase in average selling prices 
increased demand in the healthcare and automotive end markets offset declines in the appliance and building construction sectors 
operating income was million  up from this increase was due to higher sales  expanded gross margins resulting from a favorable sales mix and lower unit delivery costs 
selling and general administrative costs were slightly lower due to lower bad debt costs that offset higher investment in commercial resources 
resin intermediates operating income declined  or million  versus as the slowdown in commercial and residential construction markets and downward margin pressure from rising feedstock costs severely impacted the results of oxyvinyls 
in july  we divested our interest in oxyvinyls  which in the second half of contributed million to segment earnings 
sunbelt earnings were million lower in compared to due to a decline in sales that offset higher year over year ecu netbacks  which were up slightly more than 
all other all other includes the north american color and additives  north american engineered materials  producer services and specialty inks and polymer systems operating segments 
sales in aggregate were down from due mainly to a decline in north american color and additives sales resulting from the pruning of unprofitable business and withdrawing from certain general purpose oriented applications 
north american engineered materials sales grew due to continued progress in capturing specialized applications in the electrical electronics and medical end markets  as well as solid growth in wire and cable applications  where sales were up 
producer services sales were up compared to primarily reflecting the full year impact of the dh compounding acquisition which added million of sales 
specialty inks and polymer systems sales grew primarily due to the growth of our global inks business 
aggregate operating income was million in compared to a million loss in  an increase of million 
north american color and additives operating income increased million due to a stronger product mix driven by the benefits of improved commercial disciplines  the pruning of unprofitable business and lower operating costs 
producer services and specialty inks and polymer systems operating income also improved significantly in as compared to both businesses delivered or better improvements in operating income 
in producer services  operating margins improved due to value added selling activities to enhance the profitability of the customer mix and the full year impact of the dh compounding acquisition 
specialty inks and polymer systems profitability was up more than reflecting a strong sales mix of inks and urethanes products

these costs are included in corporate and eliminations 
vinyl business sales were flat in compared to as higher average selling prices offset lower volume 
selling prices at the beginning of reflected the increases that we realized in the fourth quarter of volume was down as a result of slower building and construction market demand in the second half of compared with the unusually high demand in the second half of due to the rebuilding activities that were created in the wake of hurricanes katrina and rita 
also negatively impacting volume was greater competition from overseas suppliers who increased their market share  largely in flooring applications  in the second half of operating income increased million  or  to million in as compared to strong demand coupled with intensified value selling activities and pricing actions to recover rising energy and feedstock costs all contributed to expanding margins 
polyone corporation international color and engineered materials sales reached million in which represented a increase over sales in asia grew due to strong demand for our products in the appliance and electrical and electronics end markets  and sales growth of our colorants and additives  particularly into specialty packaging applications 
european sales were up due to overall improvements in the economic environment in the euro zone  recapture of market share  penetration of higher margin specialty markets  and favorable foreign exchange impact which contributed approximately million to the overall sales increase 
operating income increased million  or from  primarily as a result of a shift in mix to higher margin products  strong sales growth  and increased margins due to value added selling activities 
differences in average currency exchange rates did not materially impact earnings 
distribution sales were million in  an increase of versus led by an increase in selling prices and a increase in shipment volume 
the increase in selling prices was driven by both passing through increases from our supplier base and from a slight shift in mix towards higher priced engineered products 
the small change in volume was a result of gains from our national account programs more than offsetting softening demand in the building and construction and automotive markets in the second half of operating income decreased million in due to increased investment in commercial resources 
hurricanes katrina and rita caused a surge in demand in that temporarily increased selling prices and margins  both of which have returned to normalized levels in as demand has softened 
resin and intermediates resin and intermediates operating income increased million  or  over oxyvinyls equity earnings increased million primarily due to higher industry average pvc resin and vcm price spreads over raw material costs 
sunbelt s equity earnings increased million due to higher selling prices for chlorine and caustic soda that were driven by strong demand 
all other all other includes the north american color and additives  north american engineered materials  producer services and specialty inks and polymer systems operating segments 
sales in aggregate were million in  up from all of the operating segments except for north american color and additives achieved sales growth in excess of 
in  demand generated from the rebuilding activities in the aftermath of the hurricanes that impacted the us gulf coast drove strong improvements in year over year sales for our wire cable and general purpose pipe products 
in addition  we started to see positive results in our north american engineered materials business from our investments in commercial resources and the launch of new technology platforms  both of which contributed to a increase in sales versus specialty inks and polymer systems s sales increased in compared to from increased sales of higher priced products such as inks and specialty colorants  the introduction of new products  higher selling prices and continued global growth 
the remaining interest in dh compounding was acquired in fourth quarter and had a modest impact on sales growth 
operating income in for all other was million  but this result was a million improvement compared to north american color and additives and north american engineered materials demonstrated and improvements  respectively  in operating income due to improved demand  aggressive margin improvement actions related to value added pricing and cost structure improvements 
impact of inflation although inflation has slowed in recent years  we believe it remains a factor in our economy and we continually seek ways to lessen its impact 
toward that end  we deploy three primary mitigating strategies a within the context of competitive markets  we offset higher raw material and energy costs by increasing the prices of our products to customers over time  b we are improving our ability to sell higher valued specialized materials  services and solutions to our customers where price is determined by value received by the customer rather than by changes to cost inputs  and c we are implementing specific efficiency programs such as lean six sigma  energy conservation initiatives  and inventory and distribution cost optimization programs  that are expected to lower our delivered cost of product to customers  helping to negate portions of the detrimental effect of inflation 
additionally  we use the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for of our inventories and the first in  first out fifo or average cost method for the remainder 
under the lifo method  the cost of products sold that are reported in the financial statements approximates current costs  providing a better match of current period revenue and expenses 
charges to operations for depreciation represent the allocation of historical costs incurred over past years and are lower than if they were based on the current cost of the productive capacity that is being consumed 
critical accounting policies and estimates significant accounting policies are described more fully in note c to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the related facts and circumstances 
the application of these critical accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions for future uncertainties 
accordingly  actual results polyone corporation could differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
sales discounts and rebates sales discounts and rebates are offered to certain customers to promote customer loyalty and to encourage greater product sales 
these programs provide customers with credits against their purchases if they attain pre established volumes or revenue milestones for a specific period 
we estimate the provision for rebates based on the specific terms of each agreement at the time of shipment and an estimate of the customer s future achievement of the respective volume or revenue milestones 
the actual amounts earned can differ from these estimates 
in the past  the actual amounts earned by our customers have not differed materially from our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are determined based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
in establishing the appropriate provisions for customer receivable balances  we make assumptions about their future collectibility 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of each customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
we regularly analyze significant customer accounts and record a specific reserve to reduce the related receivable to the amount we reasonably believe is collectible when we become aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or deterioration in the customer s operating results or financial position 
we also record reserves for all other customers based on a variety of factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  the financial health of the customer  economic conditions and our historical experience 
if circumstances related to specific customers change  our estimates of the collectibility of receivables may be adjusted further 
in the past  the actual losses incurred have differed from our estimates primarily as a result of unforeseen bankruptcy filings by our customers 
environmental accrued liability based upon estimates prepared by our environmental engineers and consultants  we have million accrued at december  to cover probable future environmental remediation expenditures 
we do not believe that any of these matters  either individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flow beyond the amount accrued 
this accrual represents our best estimate of the remaining probable remediation costs based upon information and technology currently available and our view of the most likely remedy 
depending upon the results of future testing  the ultimate remediation alternatives undertaken  changes in regulations  new information  newly discovered conditions and other factors  it is reasonably possible that we could incur additional costs in excess of the amount accrued 
however  such additional costs  if any  cannot currently be estimated 
our estimate of this liability may be revised as new regulations or technologies are developed or additional information is obtained 
changes during the past five years have primarily resulted from an increase in the estimate of future remediation costs at existing sites and payments made each year for remediation costs that were already accrued 
for more information about our environmental liabilities  see note n to the consolidated financial statements 
asbestos related claims we have been named in various lawsuits involving multiple claimants and defendants for alleged asbestos exposure in the past by  among others  workers and contractors and their families at plants owned by us or our predecessors  or on board ships owned or operated by us or our predecessors 
we have reserves totaling million as of december  for asbestos related claims that are probable and estimable 
we believe that the probability is remote that losses in excess of the amounts we have accrued could be materially adverse to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
if the underlying facts and circumstances change in the future  we will modify our reserves  as appropriate 
the amount of this accrual has not materially changed over the past several years 
restructuring related accruals since polyone was formed in  we have recorded accruals for charges in connection with restructuring our businesses  as well as integrating acquired businesses 
these accruals include estimates related to employee separation costs  the closure and or consolidation of facilities  contractual obligations and the value of assets such as property  plant and equipment  and inventories 
actual amounts could differ from the original estimates  and have differed in the past primarily from differences between estimated and actual net proceeds received upon the sale of property  plant and equipment 
restructuring related accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis and changes to these accruals are made when changes to plans occur 
changes to restructuring plans for existing businesses are recorded as employee separation and plant phaseout costs in the period when the change occurs 
for more information about our restructuring activities  see note e to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to perform impairment tests of our goodwill and intangible assets 
these tests must be done at least once a year  and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment or a decline in value may have occurred 
we test for goodwill impairment on july of each year 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires us to make judgments about the assumptions that we use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit based on a number of factors  including projected future operating results and business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  comparable marketplace data from within a consistent industry grouping  and the cost of capital 
we compare these estimated fair values with their carrying values  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is polyone corporation performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is then compared to its corresponding carrying value 
we cannot predict what future events might adversely affect the reported value of our goodwill 
these events include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on our customer base  or a material negative change in relationships with significant customers 
for more information about our goodwill  see note d to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes estimates of full year taxable income are used in the tax rate calculations for the legal entities and jurisdictions in which we operate throughout the year and these estimates may change during the year to reflect evolving facts and circumstances 
during the year  we use judgment to estimate our income for the year 
because judgment is involved  the tax rate may increase or decrease significantly in any period 
to determine income or loss for financial statement purposes  we make estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in determining the recoverability of deferred tax assets that result from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  also requires us to reduce the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in the process of determining our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all of the available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in recent years and our forecast of future taxable income 
to estimate future taxable income we develop assumptions including the amount of future state  federal and international pre tax income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment to forecast future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our businesses 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities deals with uncertainties in applying complex tax regulations in a large number of jurisdictions 
we recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on our estimate of the extent to which additional taxes may be due 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which accruals have been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of recorded reserves  the effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted

pensions and post retirement benefits effective december   we adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of financial accounting standards board fasb statements no 
  and r 
this statement requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit post retirement plans in their balance sheets 
the overfunded or underfunded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation of the plans the projected benefit obligation for pension plans and the accumulated post retirement benefit obligation for other post retirement plans 
the change in the funded status of the plans must be recognized in the year in which the change occurs through accumulated other comprehensive income 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 we accounted for our defined benefit post retirement plans under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
sfas no 
required that a liability minimum pension liability be recorded when the accumulated benefit obligation abo liability exceeded the fair value of plan assets 
any adjustment to this liability was recorded as a non cash charge to accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
sfas no 
required that the liability that was recorded should represent the actuarial present value of all future benefits attributable to an employee s service rendered to date 
under both sfas no 
and no 
 any change in the funded status was not immediately recognized 
instead  they were deferred and recognized ratably over future periods 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recognized the amounts of prior changes in the funded status of our post retirement benefit plans through accumulated other comprehensive income 
as a result  the net impact of accounting for sfas no 
was an increase of million on a pre tax basis and a decrease of million on an after tax basis to our accumulated other comprehensive loss 
in addition  we recorded an adjustment of million to increase accumulated other comprehensive loss to record our proportionate share of oxyvinyls adoption of sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our consolidated statements of income for the year ended december  or for any prior period 
also  the adoption of sfas no 
did not affect any financial covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt and our receivables sale facility and is not expected to affect operating results in future periods 
we have several pension plans  of which only two continue to accrue benefits for certain us employees 
these two plans generally provide benefit payments using a formula that is based upon employee compensation and length of service 
length of service for determining benefit payments was frozen as of december  all us defined benefit pension plans are closed to new participants 
regarding our other subsidized post employment polyone corporation benefit plans  only certain employees hired prior to december  are eligible to participate 
included in our results of operations are significant pension and post retirement benefit costs that we measure using actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including assumptions about discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
these assumptions are updated at the beginning of each fiscal year 
we consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  when making these assumptions 
changes in pension and post retirement benefit costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
to develop our discount rate  we consider the yields of high quality  fixed income investments with maturities that correspond to the timing of our benefit obligations 
to develop our expected return on plan assets  we consider our historical long term asset return experience  the expected investment portfolio mix of plan assets and an estimate of long term investment returns 
to develop our expected portfolio mix of plan assets  we consider the duration of the plan liabilities and give more weight to equity investments than to fixed income securities 
holding all other assumptions constant  a percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have increased or decreased our net pension and post retirement expense by approximately million 
likewise  a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would have increased or decreased our net pension cost by approximately million 
market conditions and interest rates significantly affect the value of future assets and liabilities of our pension and post retirement plans 
it is difficult to predict these factors due to the volatility of market conditions 
holding all other assumptions constant  a percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have increased or decreased accumulated other comprehensive income and the related pension and post retirement liability by approximately million as of december  the rate of increase in medical costs that we assume for the next five years was held constant with prior years to reflect both our actual experience and projected expectations 
the health care cost trend rate assumption has a significant effect on the amounts reported 
holding all other assumptions constant  a percentage point increase or decrease in the health care cost trend rate would have increased or decreased our net periodic benefit cost by million and our accumulated other comprehensive income and the related post retirement liability by approximately million as of december  for more information about our pensions and post retirement benefits  see note m to the consolidated financial statements 
fasb interpretation no 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes fin  on january  the net income tax assets recognized under fin did not differ from the net assets recognized before adoption  and  therefore  we did not record a cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption of fin we are no longer subject to us income tax examinations for periods preceding  and with limited exceptions  for periods preceding for foreign  state and local tax examinations 
as of december   we have a million liability for uncertain tax positions 
this amount relates to items under examination by foreign tax authorities related to the valuation of assets 
we do not agree with the proposed adjustments and have appealed the assessments 
we do not anticipate that the disputes will be resolved in the next twelve months 
during the third quarter of  a foreign jurisdiction initiated an audit related to transfer pricing and we accrued million for the payment of income tax and interest 
the issue was resolved during the fourth quarter of and we paid million for income taxes and million for interest 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized income tax benefits in the provision for income taxes 
as of december   we have accrued million of interest and penalties 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows unrecognized tax benefits in millions balance at january  additions based on tax positions related to the current year additions for tax positions of prior years reductions for tax positions of prior years settlements balance at december  fasb staff position aug air in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities fsp aug air 
fsp aug air prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in annual and interim financial reporting periods and is effective for the first fiscal year beginning after december  oxyvinyls  a former equity affiliate sold on july   adopted fsp aug air in the first quarter of  on a retrospective basis  and used the deferral method of accounting for planned major maintenance for the effect on oxyvinyls consolidated balance sheet at january  from adopting fsp aug air was an increase of million in other assets  a decrease of million in accrued liabilities  an increase of million in minority interest and an increase of million in partners capital 
our proportionate share of oxyvinyls operations was 
the adoption of fsp aug air represents a change in accounting principle and  under the guidance of this principle  must be applied retrospectively 
under these retrospective provisions  we polyone corporation have restated our historical financial statements to reflect the change in accounting for planned major maintenance activities of our former equity affiliate  oxyvinyls

share based compensation prior to january   as provided under sfas no 
 we applied accounting principles board apb no 
and related interpretations to account for our share based compensation plans 
under apb no 
 compensation expense was recognized for stock option grants if the exercise price of the grant was below the fair value of the underlying stock at the measurement date 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  which requires us to recognize compensation expense based on the fair value on the date of the grant 
we are using the modified prospective transition method  which does not require prior period financial statements to be restated 
the impact on pre tax earnings from adopting sfas no 
r for the year ended december  was a charge of million 
the option pricing model that we used to value the stock appreciation rights granted during and was a monte carlo simulation method 
under this method  the fair value of awards on the date of grant is an estimate and is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
expected volatility was set at the average of the six year historical weekly volatility for our common stock and the implied volatility rates for exchange traded options 
the expected term of options that were granted was set equal to halfway between the vesting and expiration dates for each grant 
dividends were not included in this calculation because we do not currently pay dividends 
the risk free rate of return for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on us treasury rates in effect at the time of the grant 
forfeitures were estimated at per year based on our historical experience 
for more information on the adoption and impact of sfas no 
r  see note c and note q to the consolidated financial statements 
contingencies we are subject to various investigations  claims and legal and administrative proceedings covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of business activities

the actual amounts resulting from these matters can differ from our estimates 
new accounting pronouncements sfas no 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement  which defines fair value  establishes the framework for measuring fair value under us generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in december  the fasb issued a proposed fasb staff position fsp fas b that would delay the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis to fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted the non deferred portion of sfas no 
on january  and it did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
we are evaluating the effect that adoption of the deferred portion of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements in  specifically in the areas of measuring fair value in business combinations and goodwill impairment tests 
sfas no 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which allows entities to voluntarily choose  at specified election dates  to measure many financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the election is made on an instrument by instrument basis and is irrevocable 
sfas no

additionally  the impact of the change in working capital was a million improvement comparing versus a more comprehensive discussion of working capital is provided below 
in  net cash provided by operations increased by million compared to primarily due to a significant increase in operating earnings  higher cash distributions from equity affiliates and lower accrued expenses 
the change in operating earnings is discussed in note r segments and at the beginning of this section md a 
equity affiliate cash distributions increased million as our joint ventures in the chloro vinyl chain saw their businesses elevate to peak earnings 
working capital management our working capital management focus is on three metrics that we believe are the most critical to maximizing cash provided by operating activities 
these three metrics measure the number of days of sales in receivables dso  and the days of cost of goods sold in inventories dsi and accounts payable dsp 
these metrics allow us to understand total dollar changes in the three principal components of working capital by isolating the effects of sales and production levels in the business versus management s efforts to drive more efficient use of company funds 
the following table presents a comparison of our year end working capital metrics and the impact of changes in efficiency and volume on accounts receivable  inventories and accounts payable in days accounts receivable dso inventories dsi accounts payable dsp year end net days change in net days from prior year end the year end working capital metrics netted to a day improvement compared to as management s actions to reduce inventories due to a slower demand outlook and initiate vendor terms management programs offset a dso increase of days as customers slowed payments in light of current trends in the economy and credit market turmoil 
the year end working capital metrics netted to an unfavorable increase of days compared to due to slower collections and higher inventories as compared to year end when weather issues in the us gulf coast created an unusually favorable impact on collections and inventories levels due to material shortages 
in millions cash provided used by accounts receivable inventories accounts payable impact of change in net days impact of change in sales and production levels from december  to december   million of cash was provided by a reduction in working capital investment due to lower year end inventories  reflecting management actions  and higher outstanding payables 
in addition  inventories were favorably impacted by a million increase in our lifo reserve versus  which is due to the inflation in the cost of raw materials in  and the impact of foreign exchange 
the impact polyone corporation of lifo and foreign exchange are shown in the impact of change in sales and production levels line item in the above table 
from december  to december   million of cash was consumed in working capital investment driven by higher inventories and lower payables 
year end demand was significantly above typical seasonal levels and caused a larger than expected reduction in inventories reflecting heightened customer demand following the severe storms in the us gulf coast 
conversely  at the end of  demand softened resulting in relatively higher year end inventory levels 
the decline in accounts payable was due to lower purchases during december the year over year change in lifo was million unfavorable

in a transaction related to the sale of our interest in oxyvinyls  we purchased the remaining minority interest in powder blends  lp 
capital spending as a percentage of depreciation and amortization was 
in  we used million for investing activities  primarily for capital spending in support of manufacturing operations 
this use of cash was partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of our engineered films business 
capital spending in as a percentage of depreciation and amortization was 
in  we used million for investing activities  reflecting capital spending in support of manufacturing operations  the purchase of the remaining of star color  a thailand based color and additives business and the purchase of certain assets of novatec plastics corporation 
star color is included in our international color and engineered materials segment  and novatec s assets are included in our vinyl business segment

discontinued operations cash flows from discontinued operations are presented separately on a single line in each section of the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the absence of future cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to materially affect future liquidity and capital resources 
balance sheets the following discussion focuses on material changes in balance sheet line items from december  to december  that are not discussed in the preceding cash flows section 
pension benefits the million decrease in pension benefits was a result of a higher discount rate at december  and strong asset performance 
other non current liabilities the increase of million was primarily due to an increase of million in non current environmental reserves 
the remaining decrease in other non current liabilities is comprised of other less significant account changes such as employment costs  insurance accruals and other reserves 
capital resources and liquidity liquidity is defined as an enterprise s ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet both current and future needs 
these needs include paying obligations as they mature  maintaining production capacity and providing for planned growth 
capital resources are sources of funds other than those generated by operations 
we are not aware of any trends  demands  commitments  events  or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to result in our liquidity decreasing to the extent that it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
as of december   we had existing facilities to access available capital resources receivables sale facility  uncommitted short term credit lines and senior unsecured notes and debentures totaling million 
as of december   we had used million of these facilities  and million was available to be drawn while remaining in compliance with all covenants associated with these facilities 
as of december   we also had a million cash and cash equivalents balance that polyone corporation exceeded our typical operating cash requirements of million to million  adding to our available liquidity

the credit agreement provides for an unsecured revolving and letter of credit facility with total commitments of up to million 
the credit agreement expires on march  borrowings under the revolving credit facility are based on the applicable libor rate plus a fixed fee 
on january  we borrowed million under the agreement and entered into a floating to fixed interest rate swap to january  resulting in an effective interest rate of 
the credit agreement contains covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur liens  and various other customary provisions  including affirmative and negative covenants  and representations and warranties 
receivables sale facility the receivables sale facility was amended in june to extend the maturity to june and to among other things  modify certain financial covenants and reduce the cost of utilizing the facility 
in july  the receivable sale facility was amended to include up to million of canadian receivables  which increased the facility size to million 
the maximum proceeds that we may receive are limited to of the eligible domestic and canadian accounts receivable sold 
this facility also makes up to million available for issuing standby letters of credit as a sub limit within the million facility  of which million was used at december  the facility requires us to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio defined as adjusted ebitda less capital expenditures  divided by interest expense and scheduled debt repayments for the next four quarters of at least to when availability under the facility is million or less 
as of december   the fixed charge coverage ratio was to and we had not sold any accounts receivable  resulting in availability under the facility of million 
during january  we sold million of our undivided interest in accounts receivable 
of the capital resource facilities available to us as of december   the portion of the receivables sale facility that was actually sold provided security for the transfer of ownership of these receivables 
each indenture governing our senior unsecured notes and debentures and our guarantee of the sunbelt notes allows a specific level of secured debt  above which security must be provided on each indenture and our guarantee of the sunbelt notes 
the receivables sale facility and our guarantee of the sunbelt notes are not considered debt under the covenants associated with our senior unsecured notes and debentures 
as of december   we had not sold any accounts receivable and had guaranteed million of our sunbelt equity affiliate s debt

pension and post retirement obligations relate to our us and international pension and other post retirement plans 
based upon our interpretation of the new pension regulations  there will be minimum funding requirements in of approximately million for our us qualified defined benefit pension plans 
obligations are based on the plans current funded status and actuarial assumptions  and include funding requirements projected to be made to our qualified pension plans  projected benefit payments to participants in our other post employment benefit plans  and projected benefit payments to participants in our non qualified pension plans through we expect that profitable operations in will enable us to maintain existing levels of available capital resources and meet our cash requirements 
expected sources of cash in include net income  additional borrowings under existing loan agreements  cash distributions from equity affiliates and proceeds from the sale of previously closed facilities and redundant assets 
expected uses of cash in include interest expense and discounts on the sale of accounts receivable  cash taxes  a contribution to a defined benefit pension plan  debt retirements upon maturity  environmental remediation at inactive and formerly owned sites and capital expenditures 
capital expenditures are currently estimated to be between and million in  primarily to support strategic growth initiatives and manufacturing operations 
based on current projections  we believe that we should be able to continue to manage and control working capital  discretionary spending and capital expenditures and that cash provided by operating activities  along with available borrowing capacity under our receivables sale facility  should allow us to maintain adequate levels of available capital resources to fund our operations and meet debt service and minimum pension funding requirements for both the short and long term 
related party transactions we purchase a substantial portion of our pvc resin and all of our vcm raw materials under supply agreements with oxyvinyls 
we formerly held a equity ownership in oxyvinyls 
this ownership was sold on july  after which we no longer report related party transactions with oxyvinyls 
net amounts owed to oxyvinyls  primarily for raw material purchases  totaled million at december  our total purchases of raw materials from oxyvinyls were million during the six months ended june  and million during the year ended december  off balance sheet arrangements receivables sale facility we sell our accounts receivable to polyone funding corporation pfc  a wholly owned  bankruptcy remote subsidiary 
at december   accounts receivable totaling million were sold to pfc and  as a result  they are reflected as a reduction of accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets 
pfc in turn sells an undivided interest in these accounts receivable to certain investors and realizes proceeds of up to million 
the maximum proceeds that pfc may receive under the facility is limited to of the eligible accounts receivable sold to pfc 
at december   pfc had not sold any of its undivided interests in accounts receivable 
we retained an interest in the million of trade receivables sold by us to pfc 
as a result  this retained interest is included in accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheet at december  we believe that available funding under our receivables sale facility provides us increased flexibility to manage working capital requirements and is an important source of liquidity 
for more information about our receivables sale facility  see note i to the consolidated financial statements 
guarantee of indebtedness of others as discussed in note n to the consolidated financial statements  we guarantee million of unconsolidated equity affiliate debt of sunbelt in connection with the construction of a chlor alkali facility in mcintosh  alabama 
this debt guarantee matures in letters of credit we maintain approximately million of letters of credit under the receivables sale facility 
these letters of credit are issued by the bank in favor of third parties and are mainly related to insurance claims and interest rate swap agreements 
we have no other off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of regulation s k 
outlook our outlook for global gdp calls for overall growth in  but down about points from the level 
in north america  our outlook for gdp and industrial production growth is for a steeper year to year decline compared to our global outlook 
our outlooks for gdp and industrial production in north america assume continued weakness and volatility in financial markets as well as restrained demand growth from reduced consumer and business confidence 
the export outlook remains vibrant  based on the co factors of a weak dollar and the strong growth in developing nations 
current us leading indicators for manufacturing and employment growth do not point toward a recession  but do anticipate weakening conditions through early polyone s primary north american markets are expected to remain in decline 
the housing sector is expected to weaken further with our projection for housing starts down to approximately million units  or approximately less than levels  and the lowest level since automobile and light truck sales are also projected to decline moderately from levels to below million units and to the lowest level since eurozone economic activity is also expected to slow in  with our outlook for gdp growth down from levels 
slower growth in the uk  germany and spain are the leading factors that will affect us  with france projecting only a slight decline from levels largely as a result of consumer spending 
partially counterbalancing the slowing in western europe  eastern europe polyone corporation gdp growth  although decelerating  is projected to reach approximately industrial production growth in china is expected to remain strong with growth of approximately times gdp growth  even though gdp is anticipated to decline moderately to a level slightly below from a rate of over in india s economy is expected to continue robust expansion although gdp is expected to decline slightly year to year 
gdp growth in our other key asian markets is projected between and 
oil and natural gas prices are not expected to decrease substantially during  with prices continuing to be sensitive to shocks and perceived or real supply volatility 
moreover  high energy and hydrocarbon feedstock costs underpin anticipated year over year increases in most chloro vinyl raw materials 
ethylene and pvc resin pricing are expected to increase compared to additionally  during  significant pvc resin capacity is expected to become operational as north american producers bring announced expansion on line 
in summary  the economy is expected to affect polyone in several significant ways during softness in north american construction  particularly residential  and automotive will affect products and services sold into those markets for most if not all of continued strong growth is expected for our operations in asia  especially china and india  and also for emerging markets for our materials and services 
relatively strong growth in our operations in eastern europe should continue 
western european markets will experience lower growth rates due to the strong euro and high energy costs 
globally  growth markets such as electronics and medical and new eco friendly solutions through metal replacement or new biopolymer materials will be targeted and pursued aggressively 
we anticipate total company sales growth in the range of to  including sales from our recent gls and nhpc acquisitions  despite the likelihood of incremental degradation in the north american residential construction market 
while near term economic conditions should remain challenging  we expect full year earnings growth in growth in our non vinyl businesses  operating improvements and lower interest expense underpin current expectations 
beyond the broader economic conditions  raw material and energy costs remain a fluid dynamic that clearly could impact the magnitude and direction of our preliminary viewpoint

polyone corporation item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in interest rates on debt obligations and foreign currency exchange rates  that could impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
we intend to use these derivative financial instruments as risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
interest rate exposure we periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements that modify our exposure to interest rate risk by converting some of our fixed rate obligations to floating rates 
at december   we maintained interest rate swap agreements on five of our fixed rate obligations in the aggregate amount of million with a net fair value liability of million 
at december   we maintained interest rate swap agreements on six of our fixed rate obligations in the aggregate amount of million with a net fair value liability of million 
the weighted average interest rate for these agreements was at december  and at december  during january  four of these interest rate swap agreements in the aggregate amount of million were unwound 
there were no material changes in the market risk that we faced during for more information about our interest rate exposure  see note c to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exposure we enter into intercompany lending transactions that are denominated in various foreign currencies and are subject to financial exposure from foreign exchange rate movement from the date a loan is recorded to the date it is settled or revalued 
to mitigate this risk  we enter into foreign exchange contracts 
gains and losses on these contracts generally offset gains or losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged  and are recorded as other income or expense in the consolidated statements of income 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes
