item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis presented in this section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in item executive summary we believe that the actions we have taken during the past several years have improved the effectiveness of the basic functions of our businesses  reduced our business volatility  and led to a greater consistency in the execution of our business plan 
our goal is to build further momentum by focusing on our strengths and serving our customers well 
our four primary objectives for were as follows continue to improve the profitability of our unum us group disability line of business  ensure that all of our other product lines and businesses that are performing well continue to do so  continue to execute our capital management strategy  and successful completion of the claim reassessment process in preparation for the regulatory final examination 
in commenting on our results for  we will discuss three major topics operating performance of our three major business segments  our capital management strategy  and our outstanding legal and regulatory issues 
operating performance of our major business segments our primary focus for unum us during was continued improvement of our claims management performance in our group disability line of business  and we are pleased with the progress made during the year 
we finished with a group disability benefit ratio of percent for the fourth quarter of  consistent with the goals we established for improved claim operational effectiveness 
our priorities also included improved profitability in certain of our supplemental products and the maintenance of current performance levels in our other lines  and our operating results generally reflect achievement of these priorities 
compared to the prior year  operating income during improved percent in our group life and accidental death and dismemberment product lines and percent in our supplemental and voluntary product lines 
positive trends for our unum us group lines of business include favorable pricing trends  renewal profit improvement  and the management of case persistency 
for all of our unum us lines of business  we are aggressively managing our operating expenses and are continuing to make improvements in our operating effectiveness 
although sales for unum us in were lower than in  sales growth gained momentum during the second half of the year 
throughout the year we maintained our disciplined pricing  and our overall sales mix continues to be generally in line with our target mix 
the number of new accounts in the group core market segment  which we define for unum us as employee groups with less than  lives  increased over the prior year  which we believe is a clear indication of our strong focus in this segment 
during the third quarter of  unum us introduced simply unum  a new product offering and administrative platform designed to better meet the needs of our group core market segment and our voluntary market 
the new platform represents substantial changes in existing technologies and workflow processes  from quote and proposal to billing and administration and ultimately to the payment of claims 
the initial market rollout was limited to four pilot sales offices  with the full rollout expected to occur during the first and second quarters of our unum uk segment continues to produce excellent operating results  with an increase in segment operating income of percent for  as measured in unum uk s local currency  compared to sales in unum uk were consistent with the overall level of sales as well as sales in the core market segment  which we now define for unum uk as employee groups with less than lives 
during  unum uk continued to take advantage of the opportunities offered by age equality legislation  with million of additional sales during compared to approximately million of those types of sales in excluding sales related to the change in age equality legislation  unum uk achieved underlying sales growth of approximately percent in as compared to we are focused on increasing market awareness and demand for disability products in the uk market 

table of contents our colonial life segment also had excellent operating results for  with an increase in segment operating income of percent compared to the prior year 
colonial life s sales increased percent in over the prior year 
most notable were sales increases in the public sector market for educators and in the commercial market segment for employee groups with less than lives 
the number of new accounts increased over the prior year  although the average new case size was smaller than expected 
we are focused on maintaining profitable and sustainable sales growth for this segment 
during the latter part of  we introduced a new hospital confinement indemnity insurance plan that gives businesses the opportunity to offer their employees a solution to help fill coverage gaps in their major medical plan and help protect employees against increasing out of pocket expenses 
we also introduced a group limited benefit plan that provides businesses a product offering for their employees who do not have major medical coverage 
after completion of brand research and development in the fourth quarter of  we introduced the new colonial life brand in january the new brand includes an updated logo and tag line and is supported by a national advertising campaign 
capital management strategy in keeping with our capital planning objectives for  and as a result of the build up of excess capital from improved operating trends and in anticipation of our closed block of individual disability reserves securitization transaction  we formalized our capital management goals and objectives during the latter part of our first priority is to maintain sufficient financial flexibility to support our operations over various economic cycles and to respond to opportunities in the marketplace while positioning our company for improvements in its credit ratings 
we have set in place several financial targets which will guide our capital management decisions including maintain a risk based capital rbc ratio of percent or greater for our traditional us insurance subsidiaries 
this is to be measured on a weighted average basis using the national association of insurance commissioners naic company action level formula 
maintain leverage at approximately percent 
leverage will be measured as debt to total capital  which we define as debt plus stockholders equity  excluding the net unrealized gain or loss on securities and the net gain or loss on cash flow hedges 
this target level excludes the non recourse debt and associated capital of tailwind holdings  llc tailwind holdings and northwind holdings  llc northwind holdings 
maintain excess capital at our holding companies sufficient to cover one year of fixed charges measured as interest expense plus common stock dividends plus a capital fund which will vary with business and economic conditions 
maintain a common stock dividend yield that is near the median of our peer companies 
we consider any capital above that needed to achieve and maintain these metrics to be excess capital available to fund share repurchases  business growth  or acquisitions 
our goal in allocating excess capital is to maximize risk adjusted shareholder returns over a three to five year time period  with share repurchase used as the benchmark for evaluating uses for excess capital 
capital transactions during included the following in february  we purchased and retired million of our adjustable conversion rate equity security units 
on october   we announced the completion of a securitization of our closed block of individual disability reserves through the issuance of million floating rate  insured  senior  secured notes by our wholly owned subsidiary northwind holdings 
the transaction also included the intercompany reinsurance of billion of statutory reserves  representing approximately percent of our individual disability closed block segment  to northwind reinsurance company northwind re  a newly formed special purpose financial captive insurance company domiciled in vermont and owned by northwind holdings 
with the risk transfer to northwind re  our traditional us insurance subsidiaries were able to release excess statutory capital previously supporting this reinsured closed block business 
the excess capital was transferred to unum group from the ceding companies through extraordinary dividends 
this capital structure allows us to continue to fully support the risk profile of this closed block of business while we redeploy excess capital to other uses 

table of contents during december  we closed our october   announced tender offer and successfully retired million of outstanding debt 
we also called and retired all million principal amount of our outstanding notes scheduled to mature in also during  we made principal payments of million on our senior secured non recourse variable rate notes issued by tailwind holdings and purchased and retired million aggregate principal amount of other outstanding debt 
during december  we established a million unsecured revolving credit facility to provide additional liquidity and financial flexibility for our company 
we intend to use any drawn borrowings from the facility for general corporate purposes 
any actions that we may institute will be consistent with our capital management strategy 
at the end of  all of our financial measurements for capital management compare favorably to our target levels 
the combined rbc ratio for our traditional us insurance subsidiaries was above our target level 
our leverage ratio  when calculated excluding the non recourse debt and associated capital of tailwind holdings and northwind holdings and also allowing percent equity credit for the adjustable conversion rate equity security units that were still outstanding at the beginning of the year  was percent at the end of  compared to percent at the beginning of  subsequent to our cumulative effect adjustment to equity for the adoption of the new accounting policies related to deferred acquisition costs and income taxes 
our leverage ratio  when calculated using consolidated debt to total consolidated capital  was percent at the end of  compared to percent at the beginning of in addition  liquidity at our holding companies is greater than one year of fixed charges 
see liquidity and capital resources contained herein for further detail 
outstanding legal and regulatory issues during  we continued to make progress in resolving our outstanding legal and regulatory issues  most notably the completion of the claim reassessment process required by the and regulatory settlement agreements 
the lead regulators began the examinations of our claims handling practices and the reassessment process in june and on february   met with members of our board of directors and management to report the results and to advise that no fines will be assessed 
the final report for the examinations under the regulatory settlement agreements is expected to be completed by mid other progress on legal and regulatory issues during includes the following we received two favorable rulings dismissing  with prejudice  both the antitrust and rico causes of action in the case entitled in re insurance brokerage antitrust litigation 
additionally  in january the defendants motion for summary judgment on all erisa claims was granted 
discovery in the case remains stayed while the court considers the proper procedure for handling of the remaining state law claims and plaintiffs pursue their appeal

the settlement agreement was finalized and approved by the court in the fourth quarter of the entire cost of the settlement was covered by insurance proceeds

continued resolution of outstanding legal and regulatory issues 
we completed our claim reassessment process during  and we expect to resolve additional issues during professional development of our employees 
we have an increased focus on training and development as well as talent management and building bench strength throughout our company 
while we are confident in our business outlook  recent market and economic trends indicate the potential for an economic slowdown 
we believe the steps we have previously taken  such as product diversification across sectors and locations  the shift in our business mix  our disciplined underwriting  pricing  claims  and expense management  the positioning of our investment portfolio  and the implementation of a capital management strategy which we believe provides financial flexibility will somewhat mitigate the potential impact of an economic slowdown on our operating results 
significant transactions and events revised claim reassessment reserve estimate as previously noted  we implemented a claim reassessment process as a result of the settlement agreements we entered into with various state insurance regulators in the fourth quarter of and the settlement agreement we entered into with the california department of insurance doi in the third quarter of in the second quarter of  we increased our provision for the estimated cost of this claim reassessment process million before tax and million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned and the average cost per reassessed claim 
the revised second quarter of estimate was based on the cost of approximately percent of the potential inventory of claim reassessment information forms returned to us  with our claim reassessment on approximately percent of the forms completed at that time 
at the time of our second quarter of revision  we had not yet finalized our claim reassessment on the remaining forms but had performed a financial review and included that information in our analysis of emerging experience 
additional information regarding the second quarter revision to our estimate is as follows for the second quarter of  the overturn rate averaged percent and was percent for the first six months of the average overturn rate was percent at june from inception to date  compared to percent at december the average incurred cost per reassessed claim during the first six months of was above the assumption we used for our third quarter revision 

table of contents our assumption concerning the total number of claims projected to be reassessed remained at approximately  with slightly more claims for group long term disability and fewer for individual disability 
we increased our previous estimate for benefit costs for claims reopened for our unum us group long term disability product line million 
the revision related to the increase during the second quarter of in the overturn rate and the average cost  as well as a slightly higher number of claims 
we decreased our previous estimate for benefit costs for claims reopened for our individual disability closed block segment million 
although the experience relative to our assumptions for the overturn rate was slightly higher  experience indicated that the total number of claims for this segment would be less than our previous assumptions 
we decreased our previous estimate for the additional incremental direct claim reassessment operating expenses million due to our projections for an earlier completion of the reassessment process 
we released million for unum us group long term disability and million for our individual disability closed block segment 
these second quarter of adjustments to our claim reassessment costs decreased before tax operating earnings for our unum us group disability line of business million and increased before tax operating earnings for our individual disability closed block segment million 
we have now completed the claims reassessment process  with no further adjustments to our provision for the estimated claim reassessment costs

recourse for the payment of principal  interest  and other amounts due on the notes will be dependent principally on the receipt of dividends from northwind re  the sole subsidiary of northwind holdings

significant transactions and events revised claim reassessment reserve estimate in the first quarter of  we completed an analysis of our assumptions related to the reserves we established for our claim reassessment process 
our analysis was based on preliminary data as of the end of the first quarter of  when actual results to date were considered credible enough to enable us to update our initial expectations of costs related to the reassessment process 
we concluded that a change in our initial assumptions  primarily related to the number of claimants for whom payments will continue because the claimant remains eligible for disability payments  was warranted 
we based our conclusion and our revised estimate on the information that existed at that time  which was the actual cost related to approximately percent of the projected ultimate total number of claims expected to be reassessed 
the characteristics  profile  and cost of those initial percent of claims were more statistically credible than the information on which we based the initial charges in and based on our analysis  in the first quarter of we recorded a charge of million before tax  or million after tax  to reflect our then current estimate of future obligations for benefit costs for claims reopened in the reassessment 
the first quarter charge decreased before tax operating results for our unum us group disability line of business million and our individual disability closed block segment million 
in the third quarter of  we increased our provision for the cost of the reassessment process million before tax and million after tax based on changes in our emerging experience for the number of decisions being overturned by the reassessment process and the average cost per reassessed claim 
the revised third quarter estimate was based on the cost of approximately percent of the projected ultimate total number of claims expected to be reassessed 
the third quarter charge was comprised of million to reflect our revised estimate of future obligations for benefit costs for claims reopened in the reassessment and million for additional incremental direct claim reassessment operating expenses because of the additional time then estimated to complete the process 
our best estimate of million for the reopened claims assumed that the nature and characteristics of the approximately percent remaining claims estimated to be reassessed at that time would be similar to the 
table of contents average profile of the percent already reviewed at that time 
the third quarter charge decreased before tax operating results for our unum us group disability line of business million and our individual disability closed block segment million 
regulatory investigations beginning in  several of our insurance subsidiaries insurance regulators requested information relating to the subsidiaries policies and practices on one or more aspects of broker compensation  quoting insurance business  and related matters

following highly publicized litigation involving the alleged practices of a major insurance broker  the naic has undertaken to provide a uniform compensation disclosure amendment to the producer licensing model act that can be adopted by states in an effort to provide uniform guidance to insurers  brokers  and customers relating to disclosure of broker compensation 
we expect there to be continued uncertainty surrounding this matter until clearer regulatory guidelines are established 
in june  we received a subpoena from the nyag requesting documents and information relating to compensation arrangements between insurance brokers or intermediaries and us and our subsidiaries 
in november we entered into a settlement agreement on broker compensation with the nyag in the form of an assurance of discontinuance that provided for a national restitution fund of million and a fine of million 
we expect that the restitution fund will be fully distributed by december we support the full disclosure of compensation paid to both brokers and agents and have implemented policies to facilitate customers obtaining information regarding broker compensation from their brokers 
additionally  we provide appropriate notices to customers stating our policy surrounding disclosure and provide information on our company website about our broker compensation programs

in november  tailwind holdings  a delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of unum group  issued million of floating rate  insured  senior  secured notes in a private offering 
the payment of principal  interest  and other amounts due on the notes will be dependent principally on the receipt of dividends from tailwind reinsurance company tailwind re  the sole subsidiary of tailwind holdings

accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision to statement of financial accounting standards no

significant transactions and events california settlement agreement and amendment of the multistate market conduct examination settlement agreements in october  certain of our insurance subsidiaries entered into a settlement agreement with the california doi in connection with a market conduct examination and investigation of the subsidiaries disability claims handling practices 
the california doi had chosen not to join the fourth quarter of multistate settlement agreements our insurance subsidiaries entered into with state insurance regulators of states upon conclusion of a multistate market conduct examination 
the multistate examination resulted in a report and regulatory settlement agreements that became effective on december  as part of the settlement with the california doi  we paid a civil penalty of million and agreed to change certain practices and policy provisions related to our california business 
the settlement also incorporated claims handling practices previously covered by the multistate settlement agreements and included certain additional claims handling changes 
under the terms of the settlement  we changed certain provisions specific to california disability 
table of contents policies 
additionally as part of the settlement  we received approval from the california doi for the use of new individual and group disability policy forms  which became available for sale on november  the california settlement also incorporated the claim reassessment process contained in the multistate settlement agreements 
california claimants were included in the multistate settlement agreements and could have chosen to participate in that claim reassessment process even though california did not join the multistate settlement agreements 
under the california agreement  reassessment notices were mailed to approximately  individuals whose claims were denied or terminated between january   and september  many of these individuals had already received reassessment notices under the multistate settlement agreements 
additionally  as part of the california agreement  an individual whose claim denial or termination was upheld by our reassessment unit could request an independent review by a member of a panel established for that purpose 
we amended the multistate settlement agreements to include mailing a notice of eligibility to participate in the claim reassessment process to approximately  individuals whose claims were denied or terminated between january   and december  under the original multistate settlement agreements  claimants during this period could request participation in the reassessment process  but they were not sent a notice 
those claimants who were eligible to participate but did not receive notice pursuant to the amendment remained eligible to request participation until june  separately  we offered to reassess private label  acquired  and reinsured block claims  as well as claims administered on behalf of certain employers from january   through january  and through september  for california residents 
these approximately  claims were not included in the multistate settlement agreements  but the offer to reassess generally followed the reassessment procedures contained in those agreements 
based on the settlement agreement and related matters as they existed at that time period  in the third quarter of we recorded a charge of million before tax  or million after tax  comprised of four elements million of incremental direct operating expenses to conduct the reassessment process  million for benefit costs and reserves from claims reopened from the reassessment  million for additional benefit costs and reserves for claims already incurred and currently in inventory that were anticipated as a result of the claim process changes being implemented  and the million civil penalty

income tax under the life insurance company tax act of  us stock life insurance companies were required to maintain a policyholders surplus account containing the accumulated portion of income which had not been subjected to income tax in the year earned 
the deficit reduction act of required that no future amounts be added after to the policyholders surplus account and that any future distributions to shareholders from the account would become subject to federal income tax at the general corporate federal income tax rate then in effect 
during  
table of contents the homeland investment act of was enacted 
the homeland investment act of provided  in part  that distributions from policyholders surplus accounts during and would not be taxed 
the amount of the policyholders surplus accounts of our us insurance subsidiaries at december   was approximately million 
distributions made during by these life insurance subsidiaries  including dividend distributions  were deemed to occur first from the policyholders surplus accounts 
as a result  our us life insurance subsidiaries distributed as dividends the remaining balance of their policyholders surplus accounts to the holding company during this resulted in the elimination of a future potential tax of approximately million which had not previously been provided for in current or deferred taxes because management considered the conditions under which such a tax would be paid to be remote 
this will also allow us to engage in transactions in the future without concern for triggering a tax liability related to distributions from the policyholders surplus accounts 
in april  the internal revenue service irs completed its examination of tax years through and issued its revenue agent s report rar 
income tax liabilities of approximately million that related primarily to interest on the timing of expense deductions were released in the first quarter of  all of which was reflected as a reduction to income tax expense

during the fourth quarter of  we repatriated million in unremitted foreign earnings from our uk subsidiaries under the homeland investment act of in connection with the repatriation  we recorded current taxes payable on such previously unremitted foreign earnings of approximately million and recorded a tax benefit of approximately million as a result of the reversal of the deferred tax liability related to unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  both of which were included in the results reported for financing during  we repaid million of maturing debt 
in conjunction with the repatriation  in november  we completed a long term debt offering  issuing million of senior notes due november  closed block reinsurance recapture from centre life reinsurance ltd 
during  we recaptured a closed block of individual disability business that included approximately billion in invested assets and million of annual premium 
the effective date of the recapture was august  prior to recapture  the reinsurance contract had an embedded derivative that required the bifurcation of the derivative from the basic reinsurance contract 
the fair value attributed to the embedded derivative was reported in fixed maturity securities  and the change in the fair value of this embedded derivative was reported as a realized investment gain or loss during the period of change 
at the date of recapture  the embedded derivative was terminated  and the time value component of this derivative was recognized as a realized investment loss of million before tax 
the underlying operating results of the reinsurance contract  prior to recapture  were reflected in other income 
the recapture therefore did not have a material impact on operating income for the individual disability closed block segment

table of contents critical accounting estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
the accounting estimates we deem to be most critical to our results of operations and balance sheets are those related to reserves for policy and contract benefits  deferred acquisition costs  investments  and income taxes 
estimates and assumptions could change in the future as more information becomes known  which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed in our financial statements 
for additional information  refer to our significant accounting policies in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item reserves for policy and contract benefits our largest liabilities are reserves for claims that we estimate we will eventually pay to our policyholders 
the two primary categories of reserves are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to us 
these reserves equaled billion at december  and  or approximately percent of our total liabilities 
reserves ceded to reinsurers were billion and billion at december  and  respectively  and are reported as a reinsurance recoverable in our consolidated balance sheets 
policy reserves policy reserves are established in the same period we issue a policy and equal the difference between projected future policy benefits and future premiums  allowing a margin for expenses and profit 
these reserves relate primarily to our traditional non interest sensitive products  including our individual disability  individual and group long term care  and voluntary benefits products in our unum us segment  individual disability products in our unum uk segment  disability and cancer and critical illness policies in our colonial life segment  and  the individual disability closed block segment products 
the reserves are calculated based on assumptions that were appropriate at the date the policy was issued and are not subsequently modified unless the policy reserves become inadequate ie  loss recognition occurs 
persistency assumptions are based on our actual historical experience adjusted for future expectations 
claim incidence and claim resolution rate assumptions related to mortality and morbidity are based on actual experience or industry standards adjusted as appropriate to reflect our actual experience and future expectations 
discount rate assumptions are based on our current and expected net investment returns 
in establishing policy reserves  we use assumptions that reflect our best estimate while considering the potential for adverse variances in actual future experience  which results in a total policy reserve balance that has an embedded reserve for adverse deviation 
we do not  however  establish an explicit and separate reserve as a provision for adverse deviation from our assumptions 
we perform loss recognition tests on our policy reserves annually  or more frequently if appropriate  using best estimate assumptions as of the date of the test  without a provision for adverse deviation 
we group the policy reserves for each major product line within a segment when we perform the loss recognition tests 
if the policy reserves determined using these best estimate assumptions are higher than our existing policy reserves net of any deferred acquisition cost balance  the existing policy reserves are increased or deferred acquisition costs are reduced to immediately recognize the deficiency 
thereafter  the policy reserves for the product line are calculated using the same method we used for the loss recognition testing  referred to as the gross premium valuation method  wherein we use our best estimate as of the gross premium valuation loss recognition date rather than the initial policy issue date to determine the expected future claims  commissions  and expenses we will pay and the expected future gross premiums we will receive 
we maintain policy reserves for a policy for as long as the policy remains in force  even after a separate claim reserve is established 

table of contents policy reserves for unum us  unum uk  and colonial life products  which at december  represented approximately percent  percent  and percent  respectively  of our total gross policy reserves  are determined using the net level premium method as prescribed by gaap 
in applying this method  we use  as applicable by product type  morbidity and mortality incidence rate assumptions  claim resolution rate assumptions  and policy persistency assumptions  among others  to determine our expected future claim payments and expected future premium income 
we then apply an interest  or discount  rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims  commissions  and expenses we will pay and the expected future premiums we will receive  with a provision for profit allowed 
policy reserves for our individual disability closed block segment  which at december   represented approximately percent of our total gross policy reserves  are determined using the gross premium valuation method based on assumptions established as of january   the date of loss recognition 
key assumptions are policy persistency  claim incidence  claim resolution rates  commission rates  and maintenance expense rates 
we then apply an interest  or discount  rate to determine the present value of the expected future claims  commissions  and expenses we will pay as well as the expected future premiums we will receive 
there is no provision for profit 
the interest rate is based on our expected net investment returns on the investment portfolio supporting the reserves for this segment 
under the gross premium valuation method  we do not include an embedded provision for the risk of adverse deviation from these assumptions 
gross premium valuation assumptions do not change after the date of loss recognition unless reserves are again determined to be deficient 
we perform loss recognition tests on the policy reserves for this block of business quarterly 
the other segment includes products no longer actively marketed  the majority of which have been reinsured 
policy reserves for this segment represent billion on a gross basis  or approximately percent  of our total policy reserves 
we have ceded billion of the related policy reserves to reinsurers 
the ceded reserve balance is reported in our consolidated balance sheets as a reinsurance recoverable 
we continue to service a block of group pension products  which we have not ceded  and the policy reserves for these products are based on expected mortality rates and retirement rates 
expected future payments are discounted at interest rates reflecting the anticipated investment returns for the assets supporting the liabilities 
claim reserves claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported ibnr to us and  as prescribed by gaap  equals our long term best estimate of the present value of the liability for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses 
a claim reserve is based on actual known facts regarding the claim  such as the benefits available under the applicable policy  the covered benefit period  and the age and occupation of the claimant  as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience for factors such as the claim duration and discount rate 
reserves for ibnr claims  similar to incurred claim reserves  include our assumptions for claim duration and discount rates but because we do not yet know the facts regarding the specific claims  are also based on historical incidence rate assumptions  including claim reporting patterns  the average cost of claims  and the expected volumes of incurred claims 
our incurred claim reserves and ibnr claim reserves do not include any provision for the risk of adverse deviation from our assumptions 
claim reserves  unlike policy reserves  are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change 
each quarter we review our emerging experience to ensure that our claim reserves are appropriate 
if we believe  based on our actual experience and our view of future events  that our long term assumptions need to be modified  we adjust our reserves accordingly with a charge or credit to our current period income 
multiple estimation methods exist to establish claim reserve liabilities  with each method having its own advantages and disadvantages 
available reserving methods utilized to calculate claim reserves include the tabular reserve method  the paid development method  the incurred loss development method  the count and severity method  and the expected claim cost method 
no singular method is better than the others in all situations and for all product lines 
the estimation methods we have chosen are those that we believe produce the most reliable reserves at that time 

table of contents claim reserves supporting our unum us group and individual disability and group and individual long term care lines of business and our individual disability closed block segment represent approximately percent and percent  respectively  of our total claim reserves at december  we use a tabular reserve methodology for group and individual long term disability and group and individual long term care claims that have been reported 
under the tabular reserve methodology  reserves for reported claims are based on certain characteristics of the actual reported claimants  such as age  length of time disabled  and medical diagnosis 
we believe the tabular reserve method is the most accurate to calculate long term liabilities and allows us to use the most available known facts about each claim 
ibnr claim reserves for our long term products are calculated using the count and severity method using historical patterns of the claims to be reported and the associated claim costs 
for group short term disability products  an estimate of the value of future payments to be made on claims already submitted  as well as ibnr claims  is determined in aggregate rather than on the individual claimant basis that we use for our long term products  using historical patterns of claim incidence as well as historical patterns of aggregate claim resolution rates 
the average length of time between the event triggering a claim under a policy and the final resolution of those claims is much shorter for these products than for our long term liabilities and results in less estimation variability 
claim reserves supporting the unum us group life and accidental death and dismemberment products represent approximately percent of our total claim reserves at december  claim reserves for these products are related primarily to death claims reported but not yet paid  ibnr death claims  and a liability for waiver of premium benefits 
the death claim reserve is based on the actual face amount to be paid  the ibnr reserve is calculated using the count and severity method  and the waiver of premium benefits reserve is calculated using the tabular reserve methodology 
claim reserves supporting our unum uk segment represent approximately percent of our total claim reserves at december   and are calculated using generally the same methodology that we use for unum us disability and group life reserves 
the persistency rates we assume in calculating claim reserves for this line of business are based on standard united kingdom industry experience  adjusted for unum uk s own experience 
the majority of the colonial life segment lines of business have short term benefits  which have less estimation variability than our long term products because of the shorter claim payout period 
our claim reserves for colonial life s lines of business  which approximate percent of our total claim reserves at december   are predominantly determined using the incurred loss development method based on our own experience 
the incurred loss development method uses the historical patterns of payments by loss date to predict future claim payments for each loss date 
where the incurred loss development method may not be appropriate  we estimate the incurred claims using an expected claim cost per policy or other measure of exposure 
the key assumptions for claim reserves for the colonial life lines of business are the timing  rate  and amount of estimated future claim payments  and the estimated expenses associated with the payment of claims 
the following table displays policy reserves  incurred claim reserves  and ibnr claim reserves by major product line  with the summation of the policy reserves and claim reserves shown both gross and net of the associated reinsurance recoverable 
incurred claim reserves represent reserves determined for each incurred claim and also include estimated amounts for litigation expenses and other expenses associated with the payment of the claims as well as provisions for claims which we estimate will be reopened for our long term care products 
ibnr claim reserves include provisions for incurred but not reported claims and a provision for reopened claims for our disability products 
the ibnr and reopen claim reserves for our disability products are developed and maintained in aggregate based on historical monitoring that has only been on a combined basis

table of contents key assumptions the calculation of policy and claim reserves involves numerous assumptions  but the primary assumptions used to calculate reserves are the discount rate  the claim resolution rate  and the claim incidence rate for policy reserves and ibnr claim reserves 
of these assumptions  our discount rate and claim resolution rate assumptions have historically had the most significant effects on our level of reserves because many of our product lines provide benefit payments over an extended period of time 
the discount rate  which is used in calculating both policy reserves and incurred and ibnr claim reserves  is the interest rate that we use to discount future claim payments to determine the present value 
a higher discount rate produces a lower reserve 
if the discount rate is higher than our future investment returns  our invested assets will not earn enough investment income to support our future claim payments 
in this case  the reserves may eventually be insufficient 
we set our assumptions based on our current and expected future investment yield of the assets supporting the reserves  considering current and expected future market conditions 
if the investment yield on new investments that are purchased is below or above the investment yield of the existing investment portfolio  it is likely that the discount rate assumption on new claims will be established below or above the discount rate assumption on existing claims to reflect the new investment yield 
the claim resolution rate  used for both policy reserves and incurred and ibnr claim reserves  is the probability that a disability claim will close due to recovery or death of the insured 
it is important because it is used to estimate how long benefits will be paid for a claim 
estimated resolution rates that are set too high will result in reserves that are lower than they need to be to pay the claim benefits over time 
claim resolution assumptions involve many factors  including the cause of disability  the policyholder s age  the type of contractual benefits provided  and the time since initially becoming disabled 
we use our own claim experience to develop our claim resolution assumptions 
these assumptions are established separately for the probability of death and the probability of recovery from disability 
our studies review actual claim resolution experience over a number of years  with more weight placed on our experience in the more recent years 
we also consider any expected future changes in claim resolution experience 
the incidence rate  used for policy reserves and ibnr claim reserves  is the rate at which new claims are submitted to us 
the incidence rate is affected by many factors including the age of the insured  the insured s occupation or industry  the benefit plan design  and certain external factors such as consumer confidence and levels of unemployment 
we establish our incidence assumption using a historical review of actual incidence results along with an outlook of future incidence expectations 
establishing reserve assumptions is complex and involves many factors 
reserves  particularly for policies offering insurance coverage for long term disabilities  are dependent on numerous assumptions other than just those presented in the preceding discussion 
the impact of internal and external events  such as changes in claims management procedures  economic trends such as the rate of unemployment and the level of consumer confidence  the emergence of new diseases  new trends and developments in medical treatments  and legal trends and legislative changes  among other factors  will influence claim incidence and resolution rates 
reserve assumptions differ by product line and by policy type within a product line 
additionally  in any period and over time  our actual experience may have a positive or negative variance from our long term assumptions  either singularly or collectively  and these variances may offset each other 
we test the overall adequacy of our reserves using all assumptions and with a long term view of our expected experience over the life of a block of business rather than test just one or a few assumptions independently that may be aberrant over a short period of time 
therefore it is not possible to bifurcate the assumptions to evaluate the sensitivity of a change in each assumption  but rather in the aggregate by product line 
we have presented in the following section an overview of our trend analysis for key assumptions and the results of variability in our assumptions  in aggregate  for the reserves which we believe are reasonably possible to have a material impact on our future financial results if actual claims yield a materially different amount than what we currently expect and have reserved for  either favorable or unfavorable 

table of contents trends in key assumptions because our actual experience regarding persistency and claim incidence has varied very little from our policy reserve and ibnr claim reserve assumptions  we have had minimal adjustments to our persistency assumptions and claim incidence assumptions during and generally  we do not expect our mortality and morbidity claim incidence trends or our persistency trends to change significantly in the short term  and to the extent that these trends do change  we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time 
however  we have historically experienced an increase in our group long term disability morbidity claim incidence trends during and following a recessionary period 
should a recession occur  it is possible that our claim incidence rates for this type of product would increase 
actual interest rates and the assumptions we use to discount our reserves have generally trended downward for all segments and product lines during and reserve discount rate assumptions for new policies and new claims have been adjusted to reflect our current and expected net investment returns 
changes in our discount rate assumptions tend to occur gradually over a longer period of time because of the long duration investment portfolio needed to support the reserves for the majority of our lines of business 
both the mortality rate experience and the retirement rate experience for our block of group pension products have remained stable and consistent with expectations 
claim resolution rates have a greater chance of significant variability in a shorter period of time than our other reserve assumptions 
these rates are reviewed on a quarterly basis for the death and recovery components separately 
claim resolution rates in our unum us segment group and individual long term disability product lines and our individual disability closed block segment have over the last several years exhibited some variability 
relative to the resolution rate we expect to experience over the life of the block of business  actual quarterly rates during the period through have varied by percent in our unum us group long term disability and between and percent in our unum us individual disability recently issued line of business and in our individual disability closed block segment 
claim resolution rates are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile over short periods of time 
during and  we experienced quarter to quarter variability in our claim resolution rates 
we believe this variability was primarily the result of a short term reduction in the operating effectiveness of our unum us and individual disability closed block segment claims management performance 
during  we gained more stability in our claims management performance  and our claim resolution rates were more consistent with our long term assumptions 
our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period  both favorably and unfavorably 
we monitor and test our reserves for adequacy relative to all of our assumptions in the aggregate 
in our estimation  scenarios based on reasonably possible variations in each of our reserve assumptions  when modeled together in aggregate  could produce a potential result  either positive or negative  in our unum us group disability line of business that would change our reserve balance by percent 
using our actual claim reserve balance at december   this variation would have resulted in an approximate change either positive or negative of million to our claim reserves 
using the same sensitivity analysis approach for our individual disability closed block segment  the claim reserve balance could potentially vary by percent of our reported balance  which at december   would have resulted in an approximate change either positive or negative of million to our claim reserves 
the major contributor to the variance for both the group long term disability line of business and the individual disability closed block segment is the claim resolution rate 
we believe that these ranges provide a reasonable estimate of the possible changes in reserve balances for those product lines where we believe it is possible that variability in the assumptions  in the aggregate  could result in a material impact on our reserve levels  but we record our reserves based on our long term best estimate 
because these product lines have long term claim payout periods  there is a greater potential for significant variability in claim costs  either positive or negative 

table of contents deferred acquisition costs dac we defer certain costs incurred in acquiring new business and amortize expense these costs over the life of the related policies 
deferred costs include certain commissions  other agency compensation  selection and policy issue expenses  and field expenses 
acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business  such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy  are excluded from deferral 
over percent of our dac relates to traditional non interest sensitive products  and we amortize dac in proportion to the premium income we expect to receive over the life of the policies in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises 
key assumptions used in developing the future amortization of dac are future persistency and future premium income 
we use our own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of our businesses in determining the expected persistency and premium income 
the estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is generally higher than in the later years due to higher anticipated policy persistency in the early years  which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy 
during the years and  our key assumptions used to develop the future amortization did not change materially 
we adopted the provisions of sop effective january  the adoption of sop shortened the amortization period of our unum us and unum uk group disability  group life  and group accidental death and dismemberment products  as shown below 
the amortization periods for the other product lines were not impacted by the adoption of sop generally  we do not expect our persistency or interest rates to change significantly in the short term  and to the extent that these trends do change  we expect those changes to be gradual over a longer period of time 
presented below are our assumptions  both before and after the adoption of sop  for the years   and  regarding the length of our amortization periods and the approximate dac balance that remains at the end of years   and  as a percentage of the cost initially deferred 
and amortization period balance remaining as a of initial deferral amortization period balance remaining as a of initial deferral year year year year year unum us group disability group life and accidental death dismemberment supplemental and voluntary individual disability recently issued long term care voluntary benefits unum uk group disability group life individual disability colonial life amortization of dac on traditional products is adjusted to reflect the actual policy persistency as compared to the anticipated experience  and as a result  the unamortized balance of dac reflects actual persistency 
we may experience accelerated amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected 
because our actual experience regarding persistency and premium income has varied very little from our assumptions during the last three years  
table of contents we have had minimal adjustments to our projected amortization of dac during those years 
we measure the recoverability of dac annually by performing gross premium valuations 
our testing indicates that our dac is recoverable 
valuation of fixed maturity securities in determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary  we evaluate the following factors the probability of recovering principal and interest 
our ability and intent to retain the security for a sufficient period of time for it to recover 
whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments 
the significance of the decline in value 
the time period during which there has been a significant decline in value 
current and future business prospects and trends of earnings 
the valuation of the security s underlying collateral 
relevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cycles 
market conditions 
rating agency actions 
bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity 
adverse changes in estimated cash flows for securitized investments 
any other key measures for the related security 
our review procedures include  but are not limited to  monthly meetings of certain members of our senior management personnel to review reports on the entire portfolio  identifying investments with changes in market value of five percent or more  investments with changes in rating either by external rating agencies or internal analysts  investments segmented by issuer  industry  and foreign exposure levels  and any other relevant investment information to help identify our exposure to possible credit losses 
based on this review of the entire investment portfolio  individual investments may be added to or removed from our watch list  which is a list of securities subject to enhanced monitoring and a more intensive review 
we also determine if our investment portfolio is overexposed to an issuer that is showing warning signs of deterioration and  if so  we make no further purchases of that issuer s securities and may seek opportunities to sell securities we hold from that issuer to reduce our exposure 
we monitor below investment grade securities as to individual exposures and in comparison to the entire portfolio as an additional credit risk management strategy  looking specifically at our exposure to individual securities currently classified as below investment grade 
in determining current and future business prospects and cash availability  we consider the parental support of an issuer in its analysis but do not rely heavily on this support 
if we determine that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary  the investment is written down to fair value  and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period to the extent of the decline in value 
if the decline is considered temporary  the security continues to be carefully monitored 
these controls have been established to identify our exposure to possible credit losses and are intended to give us the ability to respond rapidly 
we have no held to maturity fixed maturity securities 
all fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value 
fair values are based on quoted market prices  where available 
private placement fixed maturity securities had a fair value of approximately billion  or percent of total fixed maturity securities  at december  private placement fixed maturity securities do not have readily determinable market prices 
for these securities  we use internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs  including valuations based on estimates of future profitability  to estimate the fair value 
additionally  we obtain prices from independent third party brokers to establish valuations for certain of these securities 
our ability to liquidate our positions in some of these securities could be impacted to a significant degree by the lack of an actively traded market  and we may not be able to dispose of these investments 
table of contents in a timely manner 
although we believe our estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities  the key assumptions about the risk free interest rates  risk premiums  performance of underlying collateral if any  and other factors involve significant assumptions and may not reflect those of an active market 
we believe that generally these private placement securities carry an average credit quality comparable to companies rated baa or bbb by major credit rating organizations 
as of december   the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of private placement fixed maturity securities included the following risk free interest rates of percent for five year maturities to percent for year maturities were derived from the current yield curve for us treasury bonds with similar maturities 
current baa corporate bond spreads ranging from percent to percent plus an additional basis points were added to the risk free rate to reflect the lack of liquidity 
an additional five basis points were added to the risk free rates for foreign investments 
additional basis points were added as deemed appropriate for certain industries and for individual securities in certain industries that are considered to be of greater risk 
increasing the basis points added to the risk free rate for lack of liquidity by basis points  increasing the five basis points added to the risk free rates for foreign investments by one basis point  and increasing the additional basis points added to each industry considered to be of greater risk by one basis point would have decreased the december  net unrealized gain in the fixed maturity securities portfolio by approximately million 
historically  our realized gains or losses on dispositions of private placement fixed maturity securities have not varied significantly from amounts estimated under the valuation methodology described above 
changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities  other than declines that are determined to be other than temporary  are reported as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
if we subsequently determine that any of these securities are other than temporarily impaired  the impairment loss is reported as a realized investment loss in our consolidated statements of income 
the recognition of the impairment loss does not affect total stockholders equity to the extent that the decline in value had been previously reflected in other comprehensive income 
there are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring our fixed maturity securities for impairments and determining when and if an impairment is other than temporary 
these risks and uncertainties include the following possibilities the assessment of a borrower s ability to meet its contractual obligations will change 
the economic outlook  either domestic or foreign  may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated  and as such  the security may not recover in value 
new information may become available concerning the security  such as disclosure of accounting irregularities  fraud  or corporate governance issues 
significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industry 
significant increases in interest rates may occur and may not return to levels similar to when securities were initially purchased 
adverse rating agency actions may occur 
pension and postretirement benefit plans we sponsor several defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit opeb plans for our employees  including non qualified pension plans 
the us pension plans comprise the majority of our total benefit obligation and pension expense 
our uk operation maintains a separate defined benefit plan for eligible employees 
the uk defined benefit pension plan was closed to new entrants on december  we follow statements of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  employers accounting for pensions  no

see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item for further discussion 
our net periodic benefit costs and the value of our benefit obligations for these plans are determined based on a set of economic and demographic assumptions that represent our best estimate of future expected experience 
major assumptions used in accounting for these plans include the expected discount interest rate and the long term rate of return on plan assets 
we also use  as applicable  expected increases in compensation levels and a weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered benefits  which reflects a health care cost trend rate 
the assumptions chosen for our pension and opeb plans use consistent methodology but reflect the differences in the plan obligations 
the assumptions are reviewed annually  and we use a december measurement date for each of our plans 
the discount rate assumptions and expected long term rate of return assumptions have the most significant effect on our net periodic benefit costs associated with these plans 
in addition to the effect of changes in our assumptions  the net periodic cost or benefit obligation under our pension and opeb plans may change due to factors such as actual experience being different from our assumptions  special benefits to terminated employees  or changes in benefits provided under the plans 
discount rate assumptions the discount rate is an interest assumption used to convert the benefit payment stream to a present value 
we set the discount rate assumption at the measurement date for each of our retirement related benefit plans to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments matched against the timing and amounts of projected future benefits 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases our costs 
the discount rate we used to determine our net periodic benefit costs for our us pension plans was percent 
for  the discount rate was percent prior to the remeasurement date of march   at which time it changed to percent 
no other assumptions were materially changed in the remeasurement  which resulted from the sale of genex and the curtailment of the pension plan benefits for the employees of genex 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the curtailment and remeasurement 
the discount rate used for the net periodic benefit costs for and for our uk pension plan was percent and percent  respectively 
the discount rate used in the net periodic benefit cost for our opeb plan for and was percent and percent  respectively 
reducing the discount rate assumption by basis points would have resulted in an increase in our pension expense of approximately million  before tax  and an increase in our benefit obligation of approximately million as of december   resulting in an after tax decrease in stockholders equity of approximately million as of december  a basis point reduction in the discount rate assumption would increase our annual opeb costs by approximately million before tax 
increasing the discount rate assumption by basis points would have resulted in a decrease in our pension expense of approximately million  before tax  and a decrease in our benefit obligation of approximately million as of december   resulting in an after tax increase in stockholders equity of approximately million as of december  a basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would not change our annual opeb costs 
long term rate of return assumptions the long term rate of return assumption is the best estimate of the average annual assumed return that will be produced from the pension trust assets until current benefits are paid 
we use a compound interest method in computing the rate of return on pension plan assets 
the investment portfolio for our us pension plans during contained a diversified blend of large cap  mid cap  and small cap equity securities  convertible securities  and 
table of contents investment grade and below investment grade fixed income securities 
assets for our uk pension plan are invested in pooled funds  with approximately percent in diversified growth assets including global equities  hedge funds  commodities  below investment grade fixed income securities  and currencies 
the remainder of the assets for our uk plan is predominantly invested in fixed interest bonds and index linked bonds 
assets for our opeb plan are invested primarily within life insurance contracts issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries 
the terms of these contracts are consistent in all material respects with those the subsidiary offers to unaffiliated parties that are similarly situated 
our expectations for the future investment returns of the asset categories are based on a combination of historical market performance and evaluations of investment forecasts obtained from external consultants and economists 
the methodology underlying the return assumption included the various elements of the expected return for each asset class such as long term rates of return  volatility of returns  and the correlation of returns between various asset classes 
the expected return for the total portfolio is calculated based on the plan s strategic asset allocation 
investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through annual liability measurements  periodic asset liability studies  and quarterly investment portfolio reviews 
risk tolerance is established through consideration of plan liabilities  plan funded status  and corporate financial condition 
the long term rate of return on assets used in the net periodic pension costs for our us qualified defined benefit pension plan for and was percent and percent  respectively 
the long term rate of return on asset assumption used for and for our uk pension plan was percent and percent  respectively  and for our opeb plan  percent for both years 
changing the expected long term rate of return on the plan assets by basis points would have changed our pension plan expense by approximately million before tax and our opeb plan expense by approximately million before tax 
a lower rate of return on plan assets increases our expense 
benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets the market related value equals the fair value of assets  determined as of the measurement date 
the assets are not smoothed for purposes of sfas the expected return on assets  therefore  fully recognizes all asset gains and losses through the measurement date 
our pension and opeb plans have an aggregate unrecognized net actuarial loss and an unrecognized prior service credit  which represent the cumulative liability and asset gains and losses and the portion of prior service credits that have not been recognized in pension expense 
as of december   the unrecognized net loss for these two items combined was approximately million compared to million at december  the decrease is primarily due to the increase in the year end discount rate 
prior to the adoption of sfas  unrecognized actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits were amortized as a component of pension expense but were not reported in companies balance sheets 
sfas requires that actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not yet been included in net periodic benefit cost as of the adoption date of sfas be recognized as components of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the unrecognized gains or losses will be amortized out of accumulated other comprehensive income and included as a component of the net benefit cost  as they were prior to the adoption of sfas our   and pension and opeb expense includes million  million  and million  respectively  of amortization of the unrecognized net actuarial loss and prior service credit 
the unrecognized net actuarial loss for our pension plans  which is million at december   will be amortized over the average future working life of pension plan participants  currently estimated at years for us participants and years for us participants 
the unrecognized net actuarial loss of million for our opeb plan will be amortized the average future working life of opeb plan participants  currently estimated at years  to the extent the loss is outside of a corridor established in accordance with gaap 
the corridor is established based on the greater of percent of the plan assets or percent of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation

table of contents decrease due to increasing discount rates  has improved the year end funding level in the plan such that it has a deficit of million as of december   compared to million as of december  the fair value of plan assets in our opeb plan was million at december  and these assets represent life insurance reserves to fund the life insurance benefit portion of our opeb plan 
our opeb plan represents a non vested  non guaranteed obligation  and current regulations do not require specific funding levels for these benefits  which are comprised of retiree life  medical  and dental benefits 
it is our practice to use general assets to pay medical and dental claims as they come due in lieu of utilizing plan assets for the medical and dental benefit portions of our opeb plan 
we expect to receive subsidies under the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of to partially offset these payments 
our expected return on plan assets and discount rate discussed above will not affect the cash contributions we are required to make to our us pension and opeb plans because we have met all minimum funding requirements set forth by the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
we had no regulatory contribution requirements for and  however  we elected to make voluntary contributions of million and million  respectively  to our us qualified defined benefit pension plan 
we expect to make a voluntary contribution of approximately million in  based on current tax law 
during  the federal government enacted the pension protection act of which requires companies to fully fund defined benefit pension plans over a seven year period beginning in we have evaluated this requirement and have made estimates of amounts to be funded in the future 
based on this assessment  we do not believe that the funding requirements of the pension protection act will cause a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
the fair value of plan assets for our uk pension plan was million at december   compared to million at year end the uk pension plan has a deficit of million at december   compared to million at december  we contribute to the plan in accordance with a schedule of contributions which requires that we contribute to the plan at the rate of at least percent of eligible salaries  sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement under uk legislation

during  we made a required contribution of million  or approximately million 
we anticipate that we will make contributions during of approximately million 
income taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our valuation allowance relates primarily to assets for foreign net operating loss carryforwards and assets for our basis in certain of our foreign subsidiaries that are not likely to be realized in the future based on our expectations using currently available evidence 
in evaluating the ability to recover deferred tax assets  we have considered all available positive and negative evidence including past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent years  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event we determine that we most likely would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an increase to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that those deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws in a multitude of jurisdictions  both domestic and foreign 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions  and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect profitability 
effective january   we adopted fin  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
the evaluation of a tax position under fin is a two step process 
the first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step is to measure a position that satisfies the recognition threshold at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold but that now satisfy the recognition threshold are recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized 
table of contents tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
if a previously recognized tax position is settled for an amount that is different from the amount initially measured under fin  the difference will be recognized as a tax benefit or expense in the period the settlement is effective 
we believe that tax positions have been reflected in our financial statements at appropriate amounts in conformity with fin consolidated operating results in millions of dollars year ended december change change revenue premium income net investment income net realized investment gain loss nm other income total benefits and expenses benefits and change in reserves for future benefits commissions interest and debt expense cost related to early retirement of debt nm deferral of acquisition costs amortization of deferred acquisition costs compensation expense other expenses total income from continuing operations before income tax income tax nm income from continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income nm not a meaningful percentage the following chart lists charges affecting the comparability of our financial results

sales do not correspond to premium income or fee income reported as revenue in accordance with gaap 
this is because new annualized sales premiums reflect current sales performance and what we expect to recognize as premium or fee income over a month period  while premium income and fee income reported in our financial statements are reported on an as earned basis rather than an annualized basis and also include renewals and persistency of in force policies written in prior years as well as current new sales 
premiums for fully insured products are reported as premium income 
fees for aso products those where the risk and responsibility for funding claim payments remain with the customer and we only provide services are included in other income 
sales  persistency of the existing block of business  and the effectiveness of the renewal program are indicators of growth in our premium and fee income 
trends in new sales  as well as existing market share  also indicate our potential for growth in our respective markets and the level of market acceptance of price changes and new product offerings 
sales results may fluctuate significantly due to case size and timing of sales submissions 

table of contents we intend to continue with our disciplined approach to pricing and also with our strategy of developing a more balanced business mix 
this strategy is expected to result in a lower premium persistency or market share  particularly in the large case unum us group market  but historically the profitability of business that terminates has generally been lower than the profitability of retained business 
we do not anticipate a decline in the number of cases  or case persistency  for our unum us group market on an aggregate basis

in the following segment financial data and discussions of segment results  operating revenue excludes net realized investment gains and losses 
operating income or operating loss excludes net realized investment gains and losses and income tax 
these are considered non gaap financial measures 
a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s performance  financial position  or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap financial measures of operating revenue and operating income or operating loss differ from revenue and income loss from continuing operations before income tax as presented in our consolidated operating results and in income statements prepared in accordance with gaap due to the exclusion of before tax realized investment gains and losses 
we measure segment performance for purposes of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  excluding realized investment gains and losses because we believe that this performance measure is a better indicator of the ongoing businesses and the underlying trends in the businesses 
our investment focus is on investment income to support our insurance liabilities as opposed to the generation of realized investment gains and losses  and a long term focus is necessary to maintain profitability over the life of the business 
realized investment gains and losses depend on market conditions and do not necessarily relate to decisions regarding the underlying business of our segments 
however  income or loss excluding realized investment gains and losses does not replace net income or net loss as a measure of overall profitability 
we may experience realized investment losses  which will affect future earnings levels since our underlying business is long term in nature and we need to earn the assumed interest rates in our liabilities

sales growth gained momentum during the second half of the year  with an increase of percent in group core market sales during the last six months of compared to the same period of sales for our individual disability line of business increased over the prior year 
we continue to focus on the multi life individual disability business  with almost percent of total sales for this line of business occurring in the multi life market 
long term care sales were generally in line with our strategy for this product line  with growth in the group product and a decline in sales for individual long term care 
our voluntary benefits sales increased in relative to the prior year  consistent with our focus on sales growth in our voluntary product lines 
we anticipate that sales for our group core market segment and our voluntary products will increase during because our focus for our renewal program was aimed primarily at improving the profitability of our large case group business  sales and persistency for the large case market segment declined during  as expected 
as previously noted  during the third quarter of  we introduced simply unum  a new product offering and administrative platform designed to better meet the needs of our group core market segment and our voluntary market 
the initial market rollout was limited to four pilot sales offices  with the full rollout expected to occur during the first and second quarters of year ended december  compared with year ended december  sales for unum us increased slightly in compared to  with a sales mix of approximately percent core market and percent large case in our group products

voluntary benefits sales increased in in comparison to as we continued to focus on the voluntary product lines for future growth 
unum us persistency and renewal of existing business a continuing part of our strategy for unum us group business involves executing our renewal programs and managing persistency in our existing blocks of business 
our renewal programs have generally been successful in retaining business that is relatively more profitable than business that terminated 
while we believe the additional premium and related profits associated with renewal activity will continue to emerge  we intend to balance the renewal program with the need to maximize persistency and retain broker relationships 
persistency  measured in both premium dollars and in number of cases  for the large case group market segment declined during relative to the prior year because of our strategy for this market 
premium persistency was also lower for our core group market segment  but case persistency for this market segment improved over the level of during  persistency for each of our product lines was generally higher than or consistent with we adopted the provisions of sop effective january   and recorded a cumulative effect adjustment which decreased our opening balance of unum us dac million 
sop provides guidance on accounting for dac on internal replacements and effectively shortens the amortization period for dac for many of our group products 
despite the shorter amortization period  we do not believe that the adoption of sop will have a material effect on amortization expense for unum us as a result of the decrease in dac from the cumulative effect adjustment 
we will continue to monitor the persistency of the existing business and reflect changes relative to our amortization assumptions  as appropriate  in the current period s amortization of dac 
in january  we began a process of filing a request with various state insurance departments for rate adjustments on one older series of individual long term care policies 
the rate adjustment brings the rates for this policy series closer to today s market  better reflecting current interest rates  higher expected future claims  persistency  experience  and other factors related to pricing individual long term care coverage 
in states for which a rate increase is submitted and approved  customers are also given options for coverage changes or other approaches that might fit their current financial and insurance needs 
higher premium income associated with the rate increases has begun to emerge and is expected to continue to do so during

our claim operational effectiveness continues to improve as a result of our organizational and process changes 
while additional performance improvement is expected to occur during  the operational improvement we have projected may occur at a slower rate  and we may incur higher than anticipated claim costs 
the net decrease in the amortization of dac is due primarily to the decrease in the level of dac for these lines of business resulting from the adoption of the new accounting policy related to dac on internal replacements  offset somewhat by higher amortization resulting from the shorter amortization period for dac 
the other expense ratio  excluding the adjustments to our claim reassessment incremental operating expense estimate  increased in compared to the prior year due to the decline in premium income as well as an increase in advertising and branding expenses and product and service development costs

the interest adjusted loss ratio for the individual disability recently issued business decreased in relative to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in the submitted claim incidence rate as well as an increase in the claim recovery rate 
the interest adjusted loss ratio for long term care was higher in than in the prior year due primarily to an increase in the submitted claim incidence rate and a decrease in the claim recovery and mortality rates 
the benefit ratio for voluntary benefits decreased in comparison to the prior year due primarily to a lower rate of paid claim incidence for the voluntary benefits disability line of business partially offset by a higher mortality rate for the voluntary life line of business

the interest adjusted loss ratio for long term care was higher in than in due primarily to the aging of the block of business 
the benefit ratio for voluntary benefits decreased in comparison to due to favorable mortality and paid incidence 
amortization of dac was higher for due primarily to the growth of the deferred asset for the multi life individual disability and voluntary benefits product lines relative to the other supplemental product lines 
the amortization period for multi life individual disability and voluntary benefits products is generally shorter than that of the other supplemental products 
the decrease in other expenses in in comparison to is driven primarily by the individual disability recently issued line of business and is due mainly to relatively flat sales for and the restructuring of the distribution model for this line of business that was implemented in mid these expense declines are partially offset by an increase in other expenses related to the voluntary benefits lines of business driven primarily by growth in those lines of business 

table of contents segment outlook our primary focus in will be continued improvement of our claims management performance in our group disability line of business along with growth in our core group market and our supplemental and voluntary lines of business 
we expect our overall benefit ratio for group disability to gradually improve to the to percent range by late to early we are focused on diversifying our product portfolio through new initiatives such as simply unum and increased focus on our group core market and voluntary product sales 
simply unum combines group and voluntary coverages on one fully integrated platform and represents substantial changes in existing technologies and workflow processes  from quote and proposal to billing and administration and ultimately to the payment of claims

also contributing to a lower 
table of contents benefit ratio for was a lower rate of claim incidence for both group long term disability and group life  partially offset by lower claim recoveries for group long term disability 
commissions increased in relative to the prior year primarily because of a higher portion of long term disability business sold and renewed in on which a commission is paid 
amortization of dac increased in due to the shorter amortization period for dac resulting from the adoption of sop the amount of the cumulative effect adjustment decreased the opening balance of unum uk dac approximately million  or million  which results in decreased amortization because of the lower deferred asset level

net investment income increased in in comparison to the prior year due primarily to growth in the level of assets supporting these lines of business 
the benefit ratio for this segment decreased in in comparison to the prior year due primarily to favorable risk experience in the accident  sickness  and disability line of business as well as the life line of business

the cancer and critical illness product line also reported a slightly lower benefit ratio in relative to the prior year 
although we continue to focus on expense management  the other expense ratio for increased in comparison to the prior year due primarily to our investment in brand and product promotion and the development of additional product offerings 
also  during we reported a one time adjustment to commissions and operating expenses that increased reported commissions and reduced other expenses for that year 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  growth in premium income was attributable primarily to current and prior period sales growth and stable persistency  partially offset by the lapsing of policies during the first quarter of for policyholders in hurricane impacted areas

also contributing to the sales increase was an increase in the number of new accounts over the prior year  offset partially by a decrease in the average new case size  which resulted in lower annualized premium per case sold 
colonial life s sales increased in compared to due to increases in both public sector and commercial market segments 
in addition  the hurricanes in the united states gulf coast region resulted in lower sales in the second half of segment outlook during  we intend to focus on sales and distribution growth by accelerating recruiting and development  capitalizing on sales opportunities where we have less market share  and assessing emerging distribution opportunities

year ended december  compared with year ended december  the decrease in premium income for relative to the prior year is due to the expected decline in this block of closed business  as well as an adjustment to premium income for a small block of ceded business for which the contract was modified during partially offsetting these declines is an increase in premium income due to the 
table of contents reinsurance recapture of a small block of business  with an effective date of january   and an annualized premium income of approximately million 
neither the contract modification nor the recapture had a material effect on operating results for this segment 
net investment income decreased slightly in compared to the prior year due to a decrease in the level of assets supporting this business and the decline in the overall portfolio yield rate 
as previously noted  during the fourth quarter of  we entered into an intercompany reinsurance transaction whereby approximately percent of our individual disability closed block segment was ceded from paul revere life  provident  and unum america to northwind re 
with the risk transfer to northwind re  we released excess statutory capital previously supporting this reinsured closed block business 
as a result  the capital allocated to our individual disability closed block segment declined  with a resulting decrease in net investment income due to the lower asset levels needed to support allocated capital 
because this is an intercompany reinsurance arrangement  reported results remain unchanged for this segment other than the lower net investment income 
other income includes the underlying results of certain blocks of reinsured business 
the interest adjusted loss ratio was lower in than the ratio for the prior year  excluding the revisions to the claim reassessment reserve estimate noted previously  due primarily to a higher rate of claim recoveries and a lower rate of submitted claims 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  during the third quarter of  we recaptured a closed block of individual disability business with approximately billion in invested assets and million of annual premium 
before the recapture  the underlying operating results of the reinsurance contract were reflected in other income 
the recapture did not have a material effect on operating results for this segment 
the increase in premium income for relative to is due to the recapture of the ceded block of business  which increased reported premium income for by approximately million relative to what was reported as premium income for the recaptured block of business in the prior year 
net investment income was higher in compared to because of the investment income related to the bonds transferred to one of our insurance subsidiaries in conjunction with the reinsurance recapture and due to an increase in bond call premiums 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in the overall portfolio yield rate and a decline in prepayment income on mortgage backed securities 
other income includes the underlying results of certain blocks of reinsured business  including the results of the recaptured block of business before the recapture date 
excluding the reserve charges noted previously  the interest adjusted loss ratio of percent was higher than the prior year ratio of percent due primarily to higher submitted claim incidence and a lower rate of claim recoveries 
other expenses  excluding charges related to the settlement agreements  decreased in in comparison to due to a payment of a judgment in a lawsuit and also to our ongoing expense management 
segment outlook as a result of the decline in capital allocated to this segment  net investment income will decrease in relative to due to the lower asset levels needed to support allocated capital 
we also expect that operating revenue and income will decline over time as this closed block of business winds down 
we believe that the interest adjusted loss ratio for this block of business will be relatively flat over the long term  but the segment may experience quarterly volatility 
claim resolution rates are very sensitive to operational and environmental changes and can be volatile over short periods of time 
during and  we experienced quarter to quarter variability in our claim resolution rates 
we believe this variability was primarily the result of a short term reduction in the operating effectiveness of our claims management performance 
during  we gained more stability in our claims management performance  and our claim resolution rates were more consistent with our long term assumptions 

table of contents our claim resolution rate assumption used in determining reserves is our expectation of the resolution rate we will experience over the life of the block of business and will vary from actual experience in any one period 
it is possible  however  that variability in our reserve assumptions could result in a material impact on our reserve levels 
other segment the other operating segment includes results from unum us insured products not actively marketed with the exception of certain individual disability products  including individual life and corporate owned life insurance  reinsurance pools and management operations  group pension  health insurance  and individual annuities 
we expect operating revenue and income resulting from the products that are not actively marketed to decline over time as these business lines wind down  and we expect to reinvest the capital supporting these lines of business in the future growth of our unum us  unum uk  and colonial life segments

a portion of the ceded corporate owned life insurance block of business surrendered during the

investments overview investment activities are an integral part of our business  and profitability is significantly affected by investment results 
we segment our invested assets into portfolios that support our various product lines 
generally  our investment strategy for our portfolios is to match the effective asset cash flows and durations with related expected liability cash flows and durations to consistently meet the liability funding requirements of our businesses 
we try to maximize investment income and assume credit risk in a prudent and selective manner  subject to constraints of quality  liquidity  diversification  and regulatory considerations 
our overall investment philosophy is to invest in a portfolio of high quality assets that provide investment returns consistent with those assumed in the pricing of our insurance products 
assets are invested predominately in fixed maturity securities  and the portfolio is matched with liabilities so as to eliminate as much as possible our exposure to changes in the overall level of interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect the amount and timing of cash flows 
we actively manage our asset and liability cash flow match  as well as our asset and liability duration match to minimize interest rate risk 
we may redistribute investments within our different lines of business  when necessary  
table of contents to adjust the cash flow and or duration of the asset portfolios to better match the cash flow and duration of the liability portfolios 
asset and liability portfolio modeling is updated on a quarterly basis and is used as part of the overall interest rate risk management strategy 
cash flows from the inforce asset and liability portfolios are projected at current interest rate levels and also at levels reflecting an increase and a decrease in interest rates to obtain a range of projected cash flows under the different interest rate scenarios 
these results enable us to assess the impact of projected changes in cash flows and duration resulting from potential changes in interest rates 
testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios enables us to choose the most appropriate investment strategy as well as to minimize the risk of disadvantageous outcomes 
this analysis is a precursor to our activities in derivative financial instruments  which are used to hedge interest rate risk and to manage duration match 
at december   the weighted average duration of our policyholder liability portfolio was approximately years  and the weighted average duration of our investment portfolio supporting those policyholder liabilities was approximately years 
we believe that our investment portfolio is positioned to lessen the potential impact of an economic slowdown on our financial position or operating results 
our portfolio is well diversified by type of investment and industry sector 
over the past few years  we have actively reduced our exposure to below investment grade fixed maturity securities  although additional downgrades may occur during an economic slowdown 
recent market concerns have been centered on several specific types of investment securities 
we have no exposure to subprime mortgages or collateralized debt obligations in our asset backed or mortgage backed securities portfolios  our exposure to alt a loans within our mortgage backed securities portfolio is less than million  and we hold less than million of collateralized debt obligations within our public bond portfolio 
we have approximately million of exposure to investments for which the payment of interest and principal is guaranteed under a financial guaranty insurance policy 
the weighted average rating of the underlying securities  absent the guaranty insurance policy  is a below is a summary of our formal investment policy  including the overall quality and diversification objectives 
the majority of investments are in high quality publicly traded securities to ensure the desired liquidity and preserve the capital value of our portfolios 
the long term nature of our insurance liabilities also allows us to invest in less liquid investments to obtain superior returns 
a maximum of percent of the total investment portfolio may be invested in below investment grade securities  percent in equity type instruments  up to percent in private placements  and percent in commercial mortgage loans 
the remaining assets can be held in publicly traded investment grade corporate securities  mortgage backed securities  bank loans  asset backed securities  government and government agencies  and municipal securities 
we intend to manage the risk of losses due to changes in interest rates by matching asset duration with liabilities  in the aggregate  to within a range of ten percent of the liability duration 
the weighted average credit quality rating of the portfolio should be bbb or higher 
the maximum investment per issuer group is limited based on internal limits established by our board of directors and is more restrictive than the five percent limit generally allowed by the state insurance departments which regulate the type of investments our insurance subsidiaries are allowed to own 
these internal limits are as follows rating internal limit in millions aaa a bbb bbb bbb bb bb bb b the portfolio is to be diversified across industry classification and geographic lines 

table of contents derivative instruments may be used to hedge interest rate risk and foreign currency risk and match liability duration and cash flows consistent with the plan approved by the board of directors 
asset mix guidelines and limits are established by us and approved by the board of directors 
the allocation of assets and the selection and timing of the acquisition and disposition of investments are subject to ratification  on a weekly basis  by an investment subcommittee appointed by our board of directors 
these actions are also reviewed and approved by the finance committee of our board of directors on a quarterly basis 
these investment policies and guidelines are reviewed and appropriately adjusted by the board of directors annually  or more frequently if deemed necessary 
investment results net investment income was  million in  an increase of percent relative to the prior year 
the increase was due primarily to growth in invested assets  partially offset by a lower yield due to the investment of new cash at lower rates than that of our overall portfolio yield and a decline in the level of prepayment income on mortgage backed securities 
the overall yield in our investment portfolio was percent as of december   and the weighted average credit rating was a this compares to an overall yield in the portfolio of percent as of december  and a weighted average credit rating of a we expect the portfolio yield to continue to gradually decline until the market rates on new purchases equal or exceed the level of the overall yield 
we recognize impairment losses when we determine that the value of certain fixed maturity securities has other than temporarily declined during the applicable reporting period  as well as when there are further declines in the values of fixed maturity securities that were initially written down in a prior period 
see critical accounting estimates contained herein in item for a complete discussion of the valuation of fixed maturity securities 
we also report changes in the fair values of certain embedded derivatives as realized investment gains and losses  as required under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
implementation issue b dig issue b  embedded derivatives modified coinsurance arrangements and debt instruments that incorporate credit risk exposure that are unrelated or only partially related to the creditworthiness of the obligor under those instruments 
during  changes in the fair value of the embedded derivatives in certain reinsurance contracts resulted in net realized losses of million  which resulted primarily from a widening of credit spreads in the overall investment market  not from credit deterioration of the investments held in the portfolios supporting the modified coinsurance reserves 
fair value changes in include an embedded derivative that was terminated when the associated reinsurance contract was recaptured in under our remaining reinsurance contracts for which dig issue b is applicable  we believe that fair value changes will be minimal

table of contents one of the factors we evaluate in determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary is our ability and intent to retain the security for a sufficient period of time for it to recover 
during the third quarter of  we recognized losses of million related to the decline in fair value below amortized cost for certain securities for which it was determined during the third quarter of that we no longer had the intent to hold to recovery or maturity due to anticipated changes in our capital requirements  as previously discussed 
also during  we recorded an adjustment to the book values and related unrealized loss of two securitized asset trusts acquired in to reflect the values that would have been present had we recorded the investment income as dividends rather than interest accretion 
the book value adjustment of million was recognized as a realized investment loss in the second quarter of because the investments no longer satisfied our investment objectives  we subsequently sold the trusts in june of and recognized a realized investment gain of million on the sale 
realized investment losses million or greater from other than temporary impairments during  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million on bonds issued by a large media company 
the company was the subject of a leveraged buyout that placed a large amount of debt on the balance sheet during because of our outlook for the future business prospects of this issuer  the length of time these securities had been in an unrealized loss position  and a change in our intent to retain the security for a sufficient period of time for it to recover  we determined that an other than temporary impairment had occurred 
these securities were investment grade at the time of purchase but were downgraded to below investment grade in the second quarter of at the time of the impairment  these securities had been in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than two years 
the circumstances of this impaired investment have no impact on other investments 
we had no individual realized investment losses million or greater from other than temporary impairments during during  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million on certificates issued by a trust backed by leases to a us based airline 
although the airline had filed for bankruptcy in the third quarter of  the bonds were secured by aircraft owned by the trust and had remained current on all interest payments to date 
however  due to the lack of clarity regarding the value of aircraft collateralizing these securities and the length of time these securities had been in an unrealized loss position  we determined that an other than temporary impairment had occurred 
these securities were investment grade at the time of purchase but were downgraded to below investment grade in the first quarter of at the time of the impairment  these securities had been continuously in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years 
the circumstances of this impaired investment have no impact on other investments 
realized investment losses million or greater from sale of fixed maturity securities we had no individual realized investments losses million or greater from the sale of fixed maturity securities during during  we recognized a loss of million on the sale of securities issued by a us based automotive parts supplier 
in an october press release  this company confirmed that due to accounting errors it would restate its previously released and first and second quarter earnings and delay third and fourth quarter earnings releases 
in a first quarter of press release  the company reported third quarter results which were significantly below expectations and also withdrew guidance of positive free cash flow for its fiscal year trade creditors put into place more stringent credit terms in response to the weaker financial results  which forced the company into bankruptcy in the first quarter of a portion of these securities had an investment grade rating at the time of purchase  and a portion was purchased after the securities had been downgraded to below investment grade in the second quarter of at the time of sale  these securities had been continuously in an unrealized loss position for a period of greater than three years

these changes are generally temporary and are not recognized as realized investment losses unless the securities are sold  it becomes unlikely that we will hold the securities until recovery based on relevant facts and circumstances  or the securities become other than temporarily impaired 
generally  below investment grade fixed maturity securities are more likely to develop credit concerns 
in determining whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary  we utilize a formal  well defined  and disciplined process to monitor and evaluate our fixed income investment portfolio 
the process results in a thorough evaluation of problem investments and the recording of realized losses on a timely basis for investments determined to have an other than temporary impairment 
for those fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss and on which we have not recorded an impairment loss  we believe that the decline in fair value below amortized cost is temporary 
we have the ability and intent to hold our securities to the earlier of recovery or maturity 
if information becomes available that changes our assessment as to whether we will receive contractual payments related to a fixed maturity security and the security is also not projected to recover in value  the related security is generally sold 
we may also in certain circumstances sell a security in an unrealized loss position because of changes in tax laws  when a merger or the disposition of a segment or product line results in positions outside of our investment guidelines  due to changes in regulatory or capital requirements  due to unexpected changes in liquidity needs  to better match portfolio cash flows  or to take advantage of relative value opportunities or tender offers that recover up to or beyond the cost of the investment 

table of contents for those securities with a gross unrealized loss of million or greater  further discussed as follows are a the factors which we believe resulted in the impairment and b the information we considered  both positive and negative  in reaching the conclusion that the impairments were not other than temporary 
the fixed maturity bond of the us government sponsored mortgage funding company was issued by the federal home loan mortgage corporation 
the bond was rated aaa by s p as of december   with no negative outlook by rating agencies or in analysts reports 
the change in the market value of this security relates to changes in interest rates after the purchase of the bond 
we believe that the decline in fair value of this security is temporary 
the market value of this security will increase if interest rates decline to levels similar to when the bonds were purchased 
we believe this is likely to occur over the life of the security 
we have the ability to hold this security to the earlier of recovery or maturity 
the principal protected equity linked note is a zero coupon bond  issued by a large  well capitalized fortune financial services company  the return of which is linked to a vanguard s p index mutual fund 
this bond matures on august  and carried the aa rating of the issuer  as determined by s p as of december  this note has an embedded derivative contract and substitutes highly rated bonds in place of the underlying s p index mutual fund to provide principal protection if there is a significant decline in the equities market 
the note derives its value from the underlying s p index mutual fund 
this note is currently at an unrealized loss because the fixed rate of accretion on the note has exceeded the rate of return on the underlying s p index fund since the purchase date of the note 
based on historical long term returns of the s p index  we believe that the value of the underlying s p index mutual fund will equate to or exceed the par value of the security at maturity 
we believe that the decline in fair value of the note is temporary 
we have the ability to hold this security to the earlier of recovery or maturity 
the fair value of the securities of the united kingdom based financial institution declined due to a significant decrease in its liquidity  although the bank of england has guaranteed the institution s deposits and senior debt securities 
in addition  at the time of the decrease in liquidity  the regulatory authority of the uk financial services industry stated that the financial institution exceeded regulatory requirements and had a good quality loan book 
two private sector bidders have presented offers to purchase the institution at prices that give equity value to the company 
we believe that the decline in fair value of these securities is temporary 
we have the ability to hold these securities to the earlier of recovery or maturity 
the fixed maturity bonds of the us based automobile manufacturer are securities issued by the manufacturer and its captive finance subsidiary 
the reduction in market value of these securities is due primarily to a decline in profitability and cash flow due to the competitive environment  a loss of market share  the shift in consumer demand  and an increase in the cost of raw materials and employee healthcare and pension benefits 
the company and its finance subsidiary both have substantial liquidity  and the company has non core automotive brands available for sale 
given this available liquidity  we believe that the decline in fair value of these securities is temporary 
we have the ability to hold these securities to the earlier of recovery or maturity 
our mortgage asset backed securities were approximately billion and billion on an amortized cost basis at december  and  respectively 
at december   the mortgage asset backed securities had an average life of years  effective duration of years  and a weighted average credit rating of aaa 
the mortgage asset backed securities are valued on a monthly basis using valuations supplied by the brokerage firms that are dealers in these securities as well as independent pricing services 
the primary risk involved in investing in mortgage asset backed securities is the uncertainty of the timing of cash flows from the underlying loans due to prepayment of principal with the possibility of reinvesting the funds in a lower interest rate environment 
we use models which incorporate economic variables and possible future interest rate scenarios to predict future prepayment rates 
we have not invested in mortgage backed derivatives  such as interest only  principal only  or residuals  where market values can be highly volatile relative to changes in interest rates 
all of our mortgage backed securities are fixed rate 
the credit quality of our mortgage backed securities portfolio has not been negatively impacted by the 
table of contents recent issues in the market concerning subprime mortgage loans 
the change in value of our mortgage backed securities portfolio has moved in line with that of prime agency backed mortgage backed securities 
as of december   our exposure to below investment grade fixed maturity securities was  million  approximately percent of the fair value of invested assets excluding ceded policy loans  compared to percent at the end of below investment grade bonds are inherently more risky than investment grade bonds since the risk of default by the issuer  by definition and as exhibited by bond rating  is higher 
also  the secondary market for certain below investment grade issues can be highly illiquid 
additional downgrades may occur  but we do not anticipate any liquidity problem caused by our investments in below investment grade securities  nor do we expect these investments to adversely affect our ability to hold our other investments to maturity 
we have a significant interest in  but are not the primary beneficiary of  a special purpose entity which is a collateralized bond obligation asset trust cbo in which we hold interests in several of the tranches and for which we act as investment manager of the underlying high yield securities 
this entity is a cash flow cbo and was fully funded at the time of issuance 
our potential losses in this cbo are limited to our investment in the entity 
our investment in this entity is reported at fair value with fixed maturity securities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of this investment was derived from the fair value of the underlying assets 
the fair value and amortized cost of this investment were million and million  respectively  at december   and million and million  respectively  at december  mortgage loans and real estate our mortgage loan portfolio was  million and million on an amortized cost basis at december  and  respectively 
we expect that we will continue to add investments in this category either through the secondary market or through loan originations 
we believe our mortgage loan portfolio is well diversified geographically and among property types 
the incidence of problem mortgage loans and foreclosure activity remains low  and we expect the level of delinquencies and problem loans to remain low in the future 
we had no impaired mortgage loans at december  impaired mortgage loans totaled million at december  real estate was million and million at december  and  respectively 
investment real estate is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
real estate acquired through foreclosure is valued at fair value at the date of foreclosure and may be classified as investment real estate if it meets our investment criteria 
if investment real estate is determined to be permanently impaired  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to fair value 
occasionally  investment real estate is reclassified to real estate held for sale when it no longer meets our investment criteria 
real estate held for sale  which is valued net of a valuation allowance that reduces the carrying value to the lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell  was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we use a comprehensive rating system to evaluate the investment and credit risk of each mortgage loan and to identify specific properties for inspection and reevaluation 
we establish an investment valuation allowance for mortgage loans based on a review of individual loans and the overall loan portfolio  considering the value of the underlying collateral 
investment valuation allowances for real estate held for sale are established based on a review of specific assets 
if a decline in value of a mortgage loan or real estate investment is considered to be other than temporary or if the asset is deemed permanently impaired  the investment is reduced to estimated net realizable value  and the reduction is recognized as a realized investment loss 
we monitor the risk associated with these invested asset portfolios and regularly review and adjust the investment valuation allowance 
we had no valuation allowance for mortgage loans at december  the balance in the valuation allowance for mortgage loans was million at december  the balance in the valuation allowance for real estate was million at december  and derivatives we use derivative financial instruments to manage reinvestment risk  duration  and currency risk 
historically  we have utilized interest rate futures contracts  current and forward interest rate swaps and options on forward interest rate swaps  current and forward currency swaps  interest rate forward contracts  forward treasury locks  currency 
table of contents forward contracts  and forward contracts on specific fixed income securities 
all of these freestanding derivative transactions are hedging in nature and not speculative 
positions under our hedging programs for derivative activity that were open during involved current and forward interest rate swaps  current and forward currency swaps  currency forward contracts  forward treasury locks  and options on forward interest rate swaps 
almost all hedging transactions are associated with the individual and group long term care and the individual and group disability products 
all other product portfolios are periodically reviewed to determine if hedging strategies would be appropriate for risk management purposes 
our current credit exposure on derivatives  which is limited to the value of those contracts in a net gain position less collateral held  was million at december  the carrying value of fixed maturity securities pledged as collateral to our counterparties was million at december  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item for additional information 
other our exposure to non current investments  on a fair value basis  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  we have an investment program where we simultaneously enter into repurchase agreement transactions and reverse repurchase agreement transactions with the same party 
we net the related receivables and payables in the consolidated balance sheets since these transactions meet the requirements for the right of offset 
we did not have any of these agreements in an open position at december  we also use the repurchase agreement market as a source of short term financing  but had no contracts for this purpose outstanding at december  liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash flows provided from operations  principally in our insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income  as well as maturities and sales of invested assets  provide the primary sources of cash 
debt and or securities offerings provide an additional source of liquidity 
cash is applied to the payment of policy benefits  costs of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  and taxes  as well as purchases of new investments 
we have established an investment strategy that we believe will provide for adequate cash flows from operations 
our policy benefits are primarily in the form of claim payments  and we have minimal exposure to the policy withdrawal risk associated with deposit products such as individual life policies or annuities 
a decrease in demand for our insurance products or an increase in the incidence of new claims or the duration of existing claims could negatively impact our cash flows from operations 
deterioration in the credit market  which could delay our ability to sell our positions in certain of our fixed maturity securities in a timely manner  could also negatively impact our cash flows 
we believe our cash resources are sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements for the next months 
during  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of unum group s common stock 
the share repurchase program does not have an expiration date  and the pace of repurchase activity will depend upon various factors such as the level of available cash  alternative uses for cash  and our stock price 
the authorization may be modified  extended  or terminated by our board of directors at any time 
during january  we repurchased approximately million of our outstanding common stock  pursuant to the share repurchase authorization  using an accelerated share repurchase agreement 
under the terms of the repurchase agreement  we may receive  or be required to pay  a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of our common stock during the term of the agreement 
any price adjustment payable to us will be settled in shares of our common stock 
any price adjustment we are required to pay will be settled  at our option  in either cash or common stock 
we expect the price adjustment to settle on or before the completion of the agreement in may during  we intend to retain sufficient capital in our traditional us insurance subsidiaries to maintain a weighted average rbc ratio in excess of our stated long term objective of percent 
we also intend to maintain 
table of contents our leverage ratio at or slightly below our target levels 
we expect that holding company liquidity will be in excess of million at the end of our cash flows from discontinued operations are combined with cash flows from continuing operations within each cash flow statement category in our consolidated statements of cash flows for the applicable periods 
the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations has not  nor is it expected to  materially affect liquidity and capital resources 
consolidated cash flows operating cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was  million for the year ended december   compared to  million and  million for the comparable periods of and operating cash flows are primarily attributable to the receipt of premium and investment income  offset by payments of claims  commissions  expenses  and income taxes 
premium income growth is dependent not only on new sales  but on renewals of existing business  renewal price increases  and stable persistency 
investment income growth is dependent on the growth in the underlying assets supporting our insurance reserves and on the level of portfolio yield rates 
increases in commissions and operating expenses are attributable primarily to new sales growth and the first year acquisition expenses associated with new business 
the level of paid claims is due partially to the growth and aging of the block of business and also to the general economy  as previously discussed in the operating results by segment 
included in operating cash flows for  and are voluntary pension contributions to our us qualified defined benefit plan of million  million and million  respectively 
we also had increased cash inflows of approximately million in due to the reinsurance recapture of a small block of individual disability business 
the year to year fluctuation in the income tax adjustment to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities is due mostly to a tax benefit recognized during which resulted from the reversal of tax liabilities related primarily to group relief benefits recognized from the use of net operating losses in a foreign jurisdiction 
investing cash flows investing cash inflows consist primarily of the proceeds from the sales and maturities of investments 
investing cash outflows consist primarily of payments for purchases of investments 
net cash used by investing activities was  million for the year ended december  compared to  million and  million for the comparable periods of and  respectively 
we had lower proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale securities in compared to  primarily due to a decrease in scheduled maturities of fixed maturity securities as well as a lower level of proceeds from principal prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
somewhat offsetting this decline was the sale of a block of available for sale securities to generate the liquidity needed to repurchase debt in the fourth quarter as part of our capital redeployment plan 
proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale securities in were higher than in due to the sale of floating rate bonds in the first quarter of which were initially purchased in the fourth quarter of with the proceeds from a debt issuance 
we invested the fourth quarter debt proceeds in short term investments and floating rate bonds to provide liquidity needed for our million purchase of debt in the first quarter of the proceeds from the subsequent sale in of these short term investments and floating rate bonds are included in sales of bonds and net purchases of short term investments in we also had higher proceeds from maturities of investments in than in due to an increase in fixed maturity security principal proceeds from bond calls and scheduled maturities  offset somewhat by a decrease in principal prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
purchases of available for sale securities increased during  in part due to the investing of the net cash inflows of million from the sale of genex and the million cash inflows from the reinsurance recapture 

table of contents purchases of other investments declined during relative to the prior years due to a decline in the purchase of commercial mortgage loans 
net purchases of short term investments increased during as a result of the liquidity needed for our capital redeployment plan previously discussed 
during the fourth quarter of  we issued million of debt and invested the proceeds in floating rate bonds and short term investments 
short term investments were used as an interim investment as we seek suitable floating rate investments to support the floating rate debt 
we also purchased short term investments throughout as we anticipated the funding needed for our common stock repurchase program 
as noted above  the proceeds from dispositions in relate to the sale of genex 
during  we had cash inflows of million related to the sale of unum uk s netherlands branch and cash outflows of million related to the genex acquisition of independent review services  inc policy loans  as reported in our consolidated balance sheet  declined during due to the surrender of a portion of our ceded corporate owned life insurance block of business 
the termination of this fully ceded business had no impact on our cash inflows or outflows 
financing cash flows financing cash flows consist primarily of borrowings and repayments of debt  issuance or repurchase of common stock  and dividends paid to stockholders 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used of million and net cash provided of million for the comparable periods of and  respectively

the payment of dividends to the parent company from our subsidiaries also requires the approval of the individual subsidiary s board of directors 
the ability of unum group and certain of its intermediate holding company subsidiaries and or finance subsidiaries to continue to receive dividends from their insurance subsidiaries without regulatory approval generally depends on the level of earnings of those insurance subsidiaries as calculated under law 
in addition to regulatory restrictions  the amount of dividends that may be paid by insurance subsidiaries will depend on additional factors  such as rbc ratios  funding growth objectives at an affiliate level  and maintaining appropriate capital adequacy ratios to support desired ratings 
insurance regulatory restrictions do not limit the amount of dividends available for distribution from non insurance subsidiaries except where the non insurance subsidiaries are held directly or indirectly by an insurance subsidiary and only indirectly by unum group

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to various market risk exposures  including interest rate risk and foreign exchange rate risk 
the following discussion regarding our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
estimates of future performance and economic conditions are reflected assuming certain changes in market rates and prices were to occur sensitivity analysis 
caution should be used in evaluating our overall market risk from the information presented below  as actual results may differ 
we employ various derivative programs to manage these material market risks 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussions of the qualitative aspects of market risk  including derivative financial instrument activity 
interest rate risk our operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations  primarily long term us interest rates 
changes in interest rates and individuals behavior affect the amount and timing of asset and liability cash flows 
we continually model and test asset and liability portfolios to improve interest rate risk management and net yields 
testing the asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate and economic scenarios allows us to choose the most appropriate investment strategy  as well as to prepare for disadvantageous outcomes 
this analysis is the precursor to our activities in derivative financial instruments 
we use interest rate swaps  interest rate forward contracts  exchange traded interest rate futures contracts  and options to hedge interest rate risks and to match asset durations and cash flows with corresponding liabilities 
assuming an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates from year end levels  the net hypothetical decrease in stockholders equity related to financial and derivative instruments was estimated to be billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the fair values of mortgage loans  which are reported in our consolidated balance sheets at amortized cost  would decrease by approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december  and  assuming a basis point decrease in long term interest rates from year end levels  the fair values of our short term and long term debt would increase approximately million and million  respectively 
the effect of a change in interest rates on asset prices was determined using a duration implied methodology for corporate bonds  private placement securities  and government and government agency securities whereby the duration of each security was used to estimate the change in price for the security assuming an increase of basis points in interest rates 
the effect of a change in interest rates on the mortgage backed securities is estimated using a mortgage analytic system which takes into account the impact of changing prepayment speeds resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates on the change in price of the mortgage backed securities 
these hypothetical prices were compared to the actual prices for the period to compute the overall change in market value 
the changes in the fair values of long term debt were determined using discounted cash flows analyses 
because we actively manage our investments and liabilities  actual changes could be less than those estimated above 
foreign currency risk we are also subject to foreign exchange risk arising from our foreign operations and certain investment securities denominated in those local currencies 
foreign operations represented percent and percent of total assets at december  and  respectively  and percent and percent of total revenue from continuing operations for and  respectively
