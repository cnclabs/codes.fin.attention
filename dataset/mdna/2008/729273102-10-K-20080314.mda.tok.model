item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a bank holding company for plumas bank  a california state chartered commercial bank 
we derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related  commercial and consumer loans and  to a lesser extent  interest on investment securities  fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and fees from the sale or referral of loans 
our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses 
we rely on locally generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans 
we are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results  like those of other financial institutions operating in california  are significantly influenced by economic conditions in california  including the strength of the real estate market 
in addition  both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the bank s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
one of our strategic objectives is to expand our banking service activities to adjacent communities 
in october  we opened a new bank owned branch in truckee  california 
this replaced a much smaller leased facility 
during the fourth quarter of we opened a commercial real estate loan office in reno  nevada 
during the second quarter of we opened a branch in redding  california and during the fourth quarter of we opened a government guaranteed lending office in auburn  california 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported 
our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and internal control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents our best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
we evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based upon management s assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of the loans  including current economic conditions  past credit experience  delinquency status  the value of the underlying collateral  if any  and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans 
we determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  primarily on an analysis of the various components of the loan portfolio  including all significant credits on an individual basis 
we segment the loan portfolio into as many components as practical 
each component has similar characteristics  such as risk classification  past due status  type of loan or lease  industry or collateral 
we cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio  which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established 
available for sale securities 
available for sale securities are required to be carried at fair value 
we believe this is a critical accounting estimate in that the fair value of a security is based on quoted market prices or if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are extrapolated from the quoted prices of similar instruments 
adjustments to the available for sale securities fair value impact the consolidated financial statements by increasing or decreasing assets and shareholders equity 

table of contents income taxes 
the company files its income taxes on a consolidated basis with its subsidiary 
the allocation of income tax expense benefit represents each entity s proportionate share of the consolidated provision for income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations 
we use an estimate of future earnings to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
if future income should prove non existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the asset may not be realized and our net income will be reduced 
the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin have been applied to all tax positions of the company as of january  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement standard for the financial statement recognition and measurement of an income tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
only tax positions that met the more likely than not recognition threshold on january  were recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption 
the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which  based on all available evidence  management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes  if any 
tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority 
the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination 
impairment of core deposit intangible 
the core deposit intangible represents the excess of the premiums paid over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired in the branch acquisitions 
the core deposit intangible is required to be amortized over its expected useful life and required to be evaluated for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the fair value of the asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount  the core deposit intangible will be written down through a charge to operations 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under sfas r  compensation cost is recognized for all awards that vest subsequent to the date of adoption based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas r 
we believe this is a critical accounting estimate since the grant date fair value is estimated using the black scholes option pricing formula  which involves making estimates of the assumptions used  including the expected term of the option  expected volatility over the option term  expected dividend yield over the option term and risk free interest rate 
in addition  when determining the compensation expense to amortize over the vesting period  management makes estimates about the expected forfeiture rate of options

the company has experienced increases in the average balance of its time deposits but declines in non interest bearing demand deposit accounts  interest bearing demand deposits  savings and money market accounts 
we continue to experience significant competition for deposits from both banking and non banking sources 
rather than increasing the rates paid on our lower yielding interest bearing transaction  money market and savings accounts to attract deposits and thereby increasing the rate paid on the entire balance of these accounts  the company has chosen to increase its level of short term time deposits and to a lesser extent to increase average short term borrowings 
this has resulted in an increase in both the volume and rate components of time deposit interest expense and the volume variance of short term borrowings

the company continues to manage the mix of its loan portfolio consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financing needs of all sectors of the area it serves 
although the company offers a broad array of financing options  it continues to concentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses 
these commercial loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses  thus limiting material exposure in any industry concentrations 
the company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property  business assets and deposit accounts  but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment 
the company s largest lending categories are real estate mortgage loans  consumer and real estate construction loans 
these categories accounted for approximately  and  respectively of the company s total loan portfolio at december   and approximately  and  respectively of the company s total loan portfolio at december  in addition  the company s real estate related loans  including real estate mortgage loans  real estate construction loans  consumer equity lines of credit  and agricultural loans secured by real estate comprised and of the total loan portfolio at december  and moreover  the business activities of the company currently are focused in the california counties of plumas  nevada  placer  lassen  modoc  shasta  and sierra and beginning in the fourth quarter of in washoe county in northern nevada 
consequently  the results of operations and financial condition of the company are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and  in particular  the residential and commercial real estate markets

in management s opinion  this loan review system facilitates the early identification of potential criticized loans 

table of contents net charge offs during the year ended december  totaled thousand  or of total loans  compared to thousand  or of total loans for and thousand  or of total loans for the allowance for loan losses stood at of total loans as of december   versus of total loans as of december  the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in loans 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of loans  including current economic conditions  maturity of the portfolio  size of the portfolio  industry concentrations  borrower credit history  collateral  the existing allowance for loan losses  independent credit reviews  current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management  regulatory agencies  and independent credit review consultants retained by the company 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
the collectibility of a loan is subjective to some degree  but must relate to the borrower s financial condition  cash flow  quality of the borrower s management expertise  collateral and guarantees  and state of the local economy 
the federal financial regulatory agencies in december issued a new interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses along with supplemental frequently asked questions 
when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the company follows these guidelines 
the policy statement revises and replaces a policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the agencies issued the revised policy statement in view of today s uncertain economic environment and the presence of concentrations in untested loan products in the loan portfolios of insured depository institutions 
the policy statement has also been revised to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and post supervisory guidance 
the policy statement reiterates that each institution has a responsibility for developing  maintaining and documenting a comprehensive  systematic  and consistently applied process appropriate to its size and the nature  scope  and risk of its lending activities for determining the amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the provision for loan and lease losses and states that each institution should ensure controls are in place to consistently determine the allowance for loan and lease losses in accordance with gaap  the institution s stated policies and procedures  management s best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance 
the policy statement also restates that insured depository institutions must maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio  and that estimates of credit losses should reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the policy statement states that prudent  conservative  but not excessive  loan loss allowances that represent management s best estimate from within an acceptable range of estimated losses are appropriate 
in addition  the company incorporates the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 which represents the sec staff s view related to methodologies and supporting documentation for the allowance for loan and lease losses that should be observed by all public companies in complying with the federal securities laws and the commission s interpretations 

table of contents the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses consists of several key elements  which include but are not limited to specific allocation for problem graded loans classified loans  general or formula allocation  and discretionary allocation based on loan portfolio segmentation 
the company s methodology incorporates the following accounting pronouncements in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and sfas accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
specific allocations are established based on management s periodic evaluation of loss exposure inherent in classified  impaired  and other loans in which management believes that the collection of principal and interest under the original terms of the loan agreement are in question 
for purposes of this analysis  classified loans are grouped by internal risk classifications which are special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
special mention loans are currently performing but are potentially weak  as the borrower has begun to exhibit deteriorating trends  which if not corrected  could jeopardize repayment of the loan and result in further downgrade 
substandard loans have well defined weaknesses which  if not corrected  could jeopardize the full satisfaction of the debt 
a loan classified as doubtful has critical weaknesses that make full collection of the obligation improbable 
classified loans  as defined by the company  include loans categorized as substandard and doubtful 
loans classified as loss are immediately charged off 
formula allocations are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics 
loss factors are based on the company s historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and on the internal risk grade of those loans and may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the formula allocation analysis incorporates loan losses over the past seven years adjusted for changes in the business cycle 
loss factors are adjusted to recognize and quantify the estimated loss exposure resulting from changes in market conditions and trends in the company s loan portfolio 
the discretionary allocation is based upon management s evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the conditions may include  but are not limited to  general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  and other business conditions

a loan is considered to be in the process of collection if  based on a probable specific event  it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current 
generally  this collection period would not exceed days 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the company s general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest 
interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable 
where the collectibility of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management  it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming days delinquent 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section 
the primary difference between impaired loans and nonperforming loans is that impaired loan recognition considers not only loans days or more past due  restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include identified problem loans other than delinquent loans where it is considered probable that we will not collect all amounts due to us including both principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement

the specific allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans was thousand and thousand at december  and  respectively 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in most cases  the company uses the cash basis method of income recognition for impaired loans 
for the years ended december   and  the company recognized thousand  thousand and thousand  respectively  of income on such loans 
it is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for loan losses so that it remains adequate to absorb the inherent risk of loss in the portfolio 
management believes that the allowance at december  is adequate 
however  the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty 
accordingly  the company cannot predict whether charge offs of loans in excess of the allowance may occur in future periods 
investment portfolio and federal funds sold 
total investment securities decreased million  or  to million as of december   down from million at december  there were no federal funds sold at december  or during the company utilized the proceeds from the maturities and calls of investment securities to provide liquidity for lending and to reduce the levels of short term borrowings as deposits declined 
the company increased its yield on interest earning assets as the average balances of lower yielding investments has decreased and the average balance of higher yielding loans has increased

as these securities mature the proceeds where used primarily to reduce short term borrowings 
during the company purchased million of us government agency securities 
this was offset by declines in investment securities related to maturities and principal repayments totaling million 

table of contents the company s investments in mortgage backed securities of us government agencies achieve both an increase in interest income and provide cash flows for liquidity and reinvestment opportunities 
at december   total balances in these mortgage backed securities amounted to million down from million at december  although these pass through securities typically have final maturities of between ten and fifteen years  the pass through nature of the monthly principal and interest payments is expected to significantly reduce the average life of these securities 
obligations of states and political subdivisions municipal securities provide attractive tax equivalent yields for the company 
since the majority of the interest earnings on these securities are not taxable for federal purposes the investment in municipal securities results in a reduction in the effective tax rate of the company 
the company classifies its investment securities as available for sale or held to maturity 
the company s intent is to hold all securities classified as held to maturity until maturity and management believes that it has the ability to do so 
securities classified as available for sale may be sold to implement the company s asset liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates  prepayment rates and similar factors

table of contents deposits 
total deposits were million as of december   a decrease of million  or  from the december  balance of million 
competition for deposit dollars throughout the company s service area  both from bank and non bank sources and a lack of deposit growth in the company s service area have contributed to this decline in deposits 
rather than increasing the rate paid on our lower yielding interest bearing transaction  money market and savings accounts to attract deposits and thereby impact the entire balance of these accounts  the company has chosen to increase its level of short term time deposits and to a lesser extent utilize short term borrowings as a source of funds

money fund plu average balances totaled million in and million in deposits represent the bank s primary source of funds 
deposits are primarily core deposits in that they are demand  savings and time deposits generated from local businesses and individuals 
these sources are considered to be relatively stable  long term relationships thereby enhancing steady growth of the deposit base without major fluctuations in overall deposit balances 
the company experiences  to a small degree  some seasonality with the slower growth period between november through april  and the higher growth period from may through october 
in order to assist in meeting any funding demands  the company maintains unsecured borrowing arrangements with several correspondent banks in addition to a secured borrowing arrangement with the federal home loan bank for longer more permanent funding needs

an increase in the company s risk based capital ratios during was attributed to increase in shareholders equity described above and a decline in the level of risk weighted assets 
the company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy  with risk based capital ratios calculated separately for the company and the bank 
management reviews these capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that they are within established internal and external guidelines 
the company s current capital position exceeds minimum thresholds established by industry regulators  and by current regulatory definitions the bank is well capitalized  the highest rating of the categories defined under federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia of the fdic has promulgated risk based capital guidelines for all state non member banks such as the bank 
these guidelines establish a risk adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off balance sheet exposures 
there are two categories of capital under the guidelines tier capital includes common stockholders equity  and qualifying trust preferred securities including notes payable to unconsolidated special purpose entities that issue trust preferred securities  less goodwill and certain other deductions  notably the unrealized net gains or losses after tax adjustments on available for sale investment securities carried at fair market value  tier capital can include qualifying subordinated debt and the allowance for loan and lease losses  subject to certain limitations 
as noted previously  the company s junior subordinated debentures represent borrowings from its unconsolidated subsidiaries that have issued an aggregate million in trust preferred securities 
these trust preferred securities currently qualify for inclusion as tier capital for regulatory purposes as they do not exceed of total tier capital  but are classified as long term debt in accordance with gaap 
on march   the federal reserve board adopted a final rule that allows the continued inclusion of trust preferred securities and or related subordinated debentures in the tier i capital of bank holding companies 
however  under the final rule  after a five year transition period goodwill must be deducted from tier i capital prior to calculating the limitation 
generally  the amount of junior subordinated debentures in excess of the tier limitation is included in tier capital

off balance sheet arrangements loan commitments 
in the normal course of business  there are various commitments outstanding to extend credits that are not reflected in the financial statements 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
annual review of commercial credit lines  letters of credit and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments 
as of december   the company had million in unfunded loan commitments and thousand in letters of credit 
this compares to million in unfunded commitments and thousand in letters of credit at december  of the million in unfunded loan commitments  million and million represented commitments to commercial and consumer customers  respectively 
of the total unfunded commitments at december   million were secured by real estate  of which million was secured by commercial real estate and million was secured by residential real estate in the form of equity lines of credit 
the commercial loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent business lines of credit  while the consumer loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent revolving credit card lines 
since  some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessary represent future cash requirements
