item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth under risk factors or in other parts of this annual report 
overview we develop and provide the leading software solutions for digital investigations  including encase enterprise  a network enabled product primarily for large corporations and government agencies  and encase forensic  a desktop based product primarily for law enforcement agencies 
we were incorporated and commenced operations in from through  we generated a substantial portion of our revenues from the sale of our encase forensic products and related services 
we have experienced increases in our revenue as a result of the release of our encase enterprise products in late  which expanded our customer base into corporate enterprises and federal government agencies 
in addition  the releases of our encase 
table of contents ediscovery solution in late and encase information assurance solution in late have increased our average transaction size 
we anticipate that sales of our encase enterprise products and related services  in particular our encase ediscovery and encase information assurance solutions  will comprise a substantial portion of our future revenues 
factors affecting our results of operations there are a number of trends that may affect our business and our industry 
some of these trends or other factors include legislative and regulatory developments 
our digital investigation solutions allow law enforcement agencies  government organizations and corporations to conduct investigations within the legal and regulatory framework 
historically  the implementation of new laws and regulations surrounding digital investigations has helped create demand for our products 
future changes in applicable laws or regulations could enhance or detract from the desirability of our products 
information technology budgets 
deployment of our solutions may require a substantial capital expenditure by our customers 
budgets for information technology related capital expenditures at corporations and all levels of government organizations are typically cyclical in nature  with generally higher budgets in times of improving economic conditions and lower budgets in times of economic slowdowns 
law enforcement agency budgets 
we sell our encase forensic products and training services primarily to law enforcement agencies 
because of the limited nature of law enforcement budgets  funds are typically initially allocated toward solving issues perceived to be the most pressing 
sales of our products could be impacted by changes in the budgets of law enforcement agencies or in the relative priority assigned to digital law enforcement investigations 
prevalence and impact of hacking incidents and spread of malicious software 
the increasing sophistication of hacking attacks on government and private networks and the global spread of malicious software  such as viruses  worms and rootkits  have increased the focus of corporations and large government organizations on digital investigations and other aspects of network security  which has  in turn  increased demand for our products 
future changes in the number and severity of such attacks or the spread of malicious software could have an effect on the demand for our products 
seasonality in revenues 
we experience seasonality in our revenues  with the third and fourth quarters typically having the highest revenues for the year 
we believe that this seasonality results primarily from our customers budgeting cycles 
the federal government budget year ends in the third calendar quarter of the year and a majority of corporate budget years end in the fourth calendar quarter of the year 
in addition  our customers also tend to make software purchases near the end of a particular quarter  which tends to make our revenues for a particular period unpredictable for a significant portion of that period 
we expect that this seasonality within particular years and unpredictability within particular quarterly periods will continue for the foreseeable future 
amount of commercial litigation 
because commercial litigation often involves ediscovery  an increase in commercial litigation could increase demand for our products and services  while a decrease in commercial litigation could decrease demand 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our financial statements  included herein at item the application of gaap requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities  and related 
table of contents disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates are made 
historically  our critical accounting estimates have not differed materially from actual results  however  changes in these accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
although we evaluate these estimates  judgments and assumptions on a regular basis and make changes accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated based on our estimates and assumptions 
to the extent there are significant differences between these estimates and actual results  our future results of operations and financial condition could be materially affected 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions involved in the accounting policies described below require the most subjective judgment and have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates  and their related disclosure in this report  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from licenses of our software and sales of related services  which include post contract customer support  or maintenance  consulting and training 
we recognize revenue in accordance with gaap as prescribed for the software industry  which are substantially governed by aicpa statement of position no 
sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and interpreted 
while these pronouncements govern the basis for revenue recognition  in applying our revenue recognition policy we must determine which portions of our revenue should be recognized currently and which portions  if any  should be deferred 
in order to determine current and deferred revenue  we make judgments and estimates with regard to future deliverable products and services and the appropriate pricing for those products and services 
in general  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable  as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
if we either enter into contracts or receive written purchase orders issued by a customer that legally bind us and the customer  we consider that as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery 
we deem delivery of products to have occurred when the title and risk of ownership have passed to the buyer 
services revenue is recognized as services are performed 
fixed or determinable fee 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to refund or adjustment and the payment terms are within normal established practices 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the credit worthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we have a reasonable basis to expect that the customer will pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue reported 
for example  for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total purchase price irrespective of invoiced allocations among the various elements we deliver  to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  to determine whether vendor specific evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered 
the vsoe of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and  for software license updates and product support services  is additionally measured by the 
table of contents renewal rate offered to the customer 
if we were to change our pricing practices or any of our other assumptions or judgments in the future  our future revenue recognition could differ significantly from our historical results 
amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements when revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the product is delivered or over the period in which the service is performed  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for such element 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in bundled software and service arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established  we use the residual method to record revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 
product revenue 
the timing of product revenue recognition is dependent on the nature of the product sold 
product arrangements comprising multiple deliverables  including software and hardware  are generally categorized into one of the following encase enterprise  encase ediscovery  encase information assurance and airs 
license revenue associated with these arrangements  exclusive of amounts allocated to maintenance and other undelivered elements for which we have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  is recognized upon delivery  provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
encase forensic 
license revenue from corporate customers  exclusive of amounts allocated to maintenance  for which we have vsoe of fair value  is recognized upon delivery  provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
because maintenance is included at no additional cost in governmental forensic arrangements  vsoe of fair value for the maintenance element for governmental customers is indeterminable  so we allocate governmental forensic product  services and maintenance revenue ratably over the longer of the contractual maintenance period months or the implied maintenance period months based on estimated fair values of the various components 
premium license support program solutions 
the premium license support program is a subscription arrangement entitling customers to receive unspecified future products and post contract customer support for a period of several years 
revenue resulting from premium license support program arrangements is recognized ratably over the contractual period beginning with the delivery of the first product 
neutrino 
our mobile device investigative solution is sold to forensic customers with a related subscription covering future adapters for newly issued cell phones 
revenue is recognized over the related subscription period 
for enterprise customers  neutrino revenue is recognized upon delivery  provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
standard maintenance is charged to entitle customers to future cell phone adapters on an if and when available basis 
hardware 
revenue associated with the sale of hardware is recognized upon shipment to the customer  provided that all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
services and maintenance revenue 
services and maintenance revenue consists of professional services  training  and maintenance 
revenue from such services is recognized as the services are provided 
we refer to revenue related to technical product support and software updates on a when and if available basis as maintenance revenue  which is recognized ratably over the applicable contractual period 
we determine the amount of maintenance revenue to be deferred through reference to substantive maintenance renewal provisions contained in each arrangement 
we consider substantive maintenance provisions to be provisions where the cost of the maintenance renewal  stated in the contract with our customer as a percentage of the product fee  is comparable to the normal pricing for maintenance only renewals 
substantially all of our customers purchase maintenance support when they acquire new software licenses and substantially all renew their maintenance support contracts annually or otherwise 

table of contents training revenues are either recognized on a per class basis upon a participant s attendance or  for those customers who have subscribed to our annual training passport program  revenue is recognized ratably over the annual period 
share based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r sfas r  share based payment 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we used the minimum value method afforded by the sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for disclosure purposes 
since all options granted prior to january  were granted at exercise prices that were equal to the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of the grant  no share based compensation for stock options was recorded in the accompanying financial statements prior to and we are not required to record compensation expense for stock options granted prior to january  unless the terms of those options are subsequently modified 
we adopted sfas r using the prospective transition method and  accordingly  since adoption  we recognize share based compensation expense for all share based awards granted after january  under that transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
with the exception of one option granted in december with market based vesting conditions  which is discussed further below  we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of share based payments and recognize that cost  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
the determination of the grant date fair value of share based awards using that model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the estimated number of years that we expect employees to hold their stock options the option term and our expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rates and dividends to be paid on our stock over that term 
the expected term life of stock option awards has been calculated using the simplified method as afforded by staff accounting bulletins sab topic no 
and because we lack sufficient historical data to provide a reasonable basis to estimate the expected term 
we lack this historical data because of two factors first  our equity incentive plan the plan was adopted in and we do not have a sufficient history of exercises and forfeitures over the typical year life of our awards to predict future option holder behavior  which is critical in estimating an expected term for our options  and  second  we believe that our december initial public offering has likely changed the historical patterns that were experienced during the brief period of time from the plan s adoption to our initial public offering 
the volatility of our common stock is estimated at the date of grant based on a weighted average of the implied volatility of publicly traded day to day options on the common stock of a select peer group of similar companies similar companies  the historical volatility of the common stock of similar companies and  beginning in late  the historical volatility of our common stock  consistent with the requirements of sfas r and sab the risk free interest rate used in option valuation is based on the implied yield in effect at the time of each option grant  based on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent expected terms 
we use a dividend yield of zero in the black scholes model  as we have no intention to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
sfas r also requires that we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can potentially have a significant effect on reported share based compensation  as the cumulative effect of adjusting the forfeiture rate for all expense amortization after january  is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
in december  we granted an option to purchase  shares of our common stock that vests  in increments  only upon attainment of specified market based conditions tied to the market value of our common stock and we may continue to award such market based vesting options from time to time in the future 
under the provisions of sfas r  the fair value of share based grants with a market vesting condition must be 
table of contents modeled and valued with a path dependent valuation technique 
accordingly  we estimate the value of such awards using the monte carlo binomial simulation model 
the primary assumptions used in the model are volatility  a risk free interest rate  starting stock price  transferability restrictions and the terms of the award  as more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
using these assumptions and inputs  in valuing the december grant  we simulated  possible price paths for our common stock over a ten year period 
for each trial  if the market conditions were met  the fair value of the option was then estimated using the black scholes model  if the market condition was not met  the options were assigned zero value 
the fair value of this award was then calculated as the average net present value across the simulation trials and a derived service period was calculated for achievement of each of the four market conditions 
under fas r  the calculated million fair value of this award must be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of approximately two years whether the market conditions are met or not so long as the grantee meets the service condition 
if we change the terms of our employee share based compensation programs  refine future assumptions  such as experiencing forfeiture rates that differ from our estimates  or if we change to other acceptable valuation models  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from historical trends and could materially affect our results of operations 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded put and call options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our stock option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and monte carlo models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the grant date fair value of share based compensation awards may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those grants in the future 
certain stock options may be forfeited or expire and result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock based compensation that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years for grants subsequent to january  see notes and of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding share based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is established through a provision for bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating individual customer accounts receivable  through consideration of the customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
in addition  we analyze our historical credit loss history and apply these loss rates to our current accounts receivable balances to verify the reasonableness of our allowance 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required in the future  which would result in increased general and administrative expense 
accounting for taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income tax liability in each of the foreign and domestic jurisdictions in which we operate by estimating our actual current tax exposure and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into 
table of contents account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
although we believe our judgments  assumptions and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known and could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes 
tax law and rate changes are reflected in the income tax provision in the period in which such changes are enacted 
as a result of the termination of our s corporation status in december  we recorded deferred tax assets  which were fully offset by a valuation allowance 
subsequently  additional deferred tax assets generated have also been offset by partial valuation allowances 
management s judgment is required in assessing the realizability of these and future deferred tax assets 
in performing these assessments  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our generating sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize a tax benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and net operating loss carryforwards 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
management will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances 
if our assessment of the deferred tax assets or the corresponding valuation allowance were to change  we would record the related adjustment as a component of the income tax provision or benefit during the period in which we make that determination 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to certain legal proceedings  as well as demands  claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business 
we periodically evaluate all pending or threatened contingencies and commitments  if any  that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position 
we assess the probability of an adverse outcome and determine if it is remote  reasonably possible or probable as defined in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
if management determines that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of our financial statements  and the amount of the loss  or the range of probable loss can be reasonably estimated  we record an accrued liability and an expense for the estimated loss 
if no accrual is made for a loss contingency because one or both of the conditions pursuant to sfas no 
are not met  but the probability of an adverse outcome is at least reasonably possible  we would disclose the nature of the contingency  if material  and provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss  or state that such an estimate cannot be made 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  any accruals recorded are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we would reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates favorably or unfavorably 
potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations

table of contents we generate product revenue principally from sales of our encase enterprise and encase forensic products 
a substantial portion of the encase enterprise and encase forensic license agreements we enter into include perpetual license terms 
in conjunction with our encase forensic software  we also sell our premium license support program product  which is sold on a subscription basis for a term of several years 
in addition  we sell our neutrino tm mobile forensic device and certain other forensic hardware which we include in other product revenue 
the first two quarters of each fiscal year are typically our period of lowest product sales due to the seasonal budgetary cycles of our customers 
the third quarter is typically the strongest sales quarter to our federal government customers 
typically  sales to our corporate customers are highest in the fourth quarter 
we introduced our encase ediscovery solution in late and encase information assurance in mid  which have significantly increased our average transaction size 
during fiscal year  we sold approximately encase ediscovery  encase information assurance and airs add on modules as compared to in and two in in addition to the factors noted below  these increases were made possible by increasingly productive selling and marketing efforts 
the number of sales and marketing personnel that we employ increased from approximately at year end to at year end  but declined to approximately at year end we believe our sales personnel productivity increases with tenure and training 
product revenues increased by million in over  with that growth driven by a million revenue increase from our encase enterprise product line  which is a reflection of the growth in the ediscovery industry 
changes in the federal rules of civil procedure in december concerning electronic discovery have contributed to the overall growth in the marketplace and sustained selling and marketing efforts also contributed to our product revenue growth 
we recently extended the estimated life of our december encase forensic version release from late into  which reduced the revenue recognized for that product during by an estimated million 
we expect revenues from our forensic products will grow at a moderate rate in in  product revenues increased by million over levels 
revenues generated from encase enterprise increased to million in from million in due to introduction of the encase ediscovery solution in late and encase information assurance in mid  overall industry growth and an increase in commissioned sales personnel in later prior to  we recognized revenues related to sales of our encase forensic product to commercial customers ratably over the maintenance period however  beginning in early  we were able to establish vsoe of the elements of such arrangements and recognize product revenues upon delivery 
as a result  we recognized an additional million of encase forensic sales product revenue in that would otherwise have been recognized in subsequent periods 
services and maintenance revenues increased million in  with our maintenance segment contributing million of that total increase by virtue of an on going overall increase in our installed product base and a high annual renewal rate by customers desiring continuing maintenance support on our products 
revenues for the professional services segment increased million as the result of a million increase in digital investigation consulting and a million increase in implementation engagements 
the number of professional services personnel has increased from in to in and in training services revenue increased million in as a result of increased class offerings and attendance 
the number of customers we train on our products tends to grow in tandem with the growth in the installed product base and the number of training seats filled increased from approximately  in to  in much of this growth is attributable to the annual training passport program we introduced in august  which generated approximately million in revenue 
in  services and maintenance revenues were million higher than in professional services revenue grew by million in as a result of increased digital investigation consulting revenue of million and increased software implementation revenue of million due to higher staffing and increased customer demand 
in addition  maintenance revenue grew by million as a result of an increasing installed product base and high maintenance renewal rates

while these costs are primarily variable with respect to sales volumes  they remain very low in relation to the revenues generated 
our gross margins can be affected by product mix  as our encase enterprise products are generally higher margin products than our encase forensic product  which is  in turn  higher margin than our hardware products 
the costs of professional services and training revenue  on the other hand  are largely comprised of employee compensation  including share based compensation  costs and related overhead expenses  travel and facilities costs 
the cost of maintenance revenue is primarily outsourced  but also includes employee compensation cost for customer technical support and related overhead costs 
cost of product revenue increased only in on an overall product revenue increase of due primarily to the relatively low variable costs associated with higher software volumes and product mix 
sales of encase enterprise  one of our higher margin products  increased at a higher rate than sales of other  lower margin  products 
in  cost of product revenue increased on an overall product revenue increase of for the same reasons as in product gross margin increased to in from in and in as the annual revenue growth rates of higher margin encase enterprise products far outpaced the growth rates in lower margin products 
total cost of services and maintenance revenue increased million  or  in  on an overall increase in services and maintenance revenue of over in  we increased our team of experienced professional services consulting personnel by ten and opened several new offices  which contributed to increased compensation expense and facilities costs of million including a million increase in share based compensation and million  respectively

depreciation and amortization year ended december  dollars in millions increase increase depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue depreciation and amortization expenses consist of depreciation and amortization of our leasehold improvements  furniture and computer hardware and software 
in and  we invested approximately million and million  respectively  in capital equipment and leasehold improvements  resulting in significant increases in depreciation and amortization expense in those years 
depreciation and amortization expense in increased million  or  from  primarily due to the opening or expansion of facilities in pasadena  california and new york city  new york and the investment in leasehold improvements  networks and phone equipment to permit several of our remote offices to safely access our corporate network 
in  depreciation and amortization expense increased million  primarily due to the purchase of computer equipment for our new employees 
interest income interest income increased to million in  compared to million in and  with the increase resulting largely from the investment of cash received from our initial public offering in mid december income tax provision our income tax provisions for and most of consist of expenses primarily related to the taxable income incurred based on our tax rate as an s corporation 
we filed an election to revoke our s corporation status on december  from and after the revocation of our s corporation status  we have been treated for federal and state income tax purposes as a c corporation and  as a result  are and will continue to be subject to state and federal corporate income taxes 
the income tax provision for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the prior year  with the increase primarily attributable to our c corporation status and an increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance for a portion of the deferred tax assets generated during for which it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized 
during the majority of and all of  the company s income tax provision was negligible due to its election to be treated as an s corporation for income tax purposes during those periods 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have largely financed our operations from our cash flow from operations 
in december  we issued and sold  primary shares of our common stock at per share  for net proceeds of million in our initial public offering 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and our cash and cash equivalents are sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 

table of contents we generate cash from operations primarily from cash collections related to the sale of our products and services 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared with net cash used in operations of million in the increase in cash provided by operations principally reflects an increase in cash collections from significantly higher sales volumes of existing products and new offerings  including encase forensic version released in december  although a notable portion of these cash flows must be deferred for recognition as revenue at a later date 
despite significantly higher revenues in  we were able to reduce the cash used to carry accounts receivable balances from million in to million in the million use of cash in operations during was largely attributable to increased payroll and related costs associated with additional sales  marketing and development personnel and higher accounts receivable balances 
the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year are our strongest quarters for cash collections  a consequence of the higher sales volumes typically experienced in the third and fourth quarters 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  whereas in  investing activities resulted in a million use of cash 
this change is largely the result of our decision to invest a considerable portion of the proceeds of our december initial public offering in short term investments prior to year end  and subsequent decision to reinvest the proceeds upon maturity into cash equivalents during additionally  cash used in investing activities in consists of capital expenditures of approximately million for the purchase of new computer equipment and the construction and build out of new office facilities in pasadena  ca  new york  ny  and near san francisco  chicago and washington  dc  compared with million in capital expenditures during we presently expect capital expenditures to approximate million to million in  which we expect to fund from operating cash flows 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased to million in  compared to in  largely due to the nonrecurring net proceeds after cash paid for related expenses of million received from our initial public offering 
on the other hand  cash received from the exercise of stock options amounted to million in compared to million in in addition  we made a cash distribution to the shareholders in respect of s corporation taxable earnings in the amount of million during for which no corresponding payment was required in in each of the periods  we also paid down capital lease obligations 
we maintain a million line of credit with a bank 
this line of credit terminates on october  at december   there were no amounts outstanding against this line 
the line requires that we maintain certain financial covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with the covenants associated with the revolving line of credit 
we currently have no material cash commitments  except our normal recurring trade payables  expense accruals and leases  all of which are currently expected to be funded through existing working capital and future cash flows from operations 
at december   our outstanding contractual cash commitments were largely limited to our non cancelable lease obligations  primarily relating to office facilities  as follows payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands capital lease obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the expansion of our selling and marketing activities  the timing and extent of research and development spending to support product development and enhancement efforts  costs associated with expansion into new territories or 
table of contents markets  the timing of the introduction of new products and services and the enhancement of existing products and the continuing market acceptance of our products and services 
to the extent that our short term investments and existing cash  the availability under our line of credit and cash from operations are insufficient to fund our future activities and planned growth  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings 
although we are currently not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to potential investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary businesses  products or technologies  we may enter into these types of arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional debt or equity financing 
additional funds may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
furthermore  although we cannot accurately anticipate the effect of inflation or foreign exchange markets on our operations  we do not believe these external economic forces have had  or are likely in the foreseeable future to have  a material impact on our results of operations 
at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose  or variable interest entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we did not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risks that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have material relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us or our related parties except as disclosed in this report

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the statement of operations 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
we will be required to adopt sfas effective january  earlier adoption is prohibited 
we do not have a noncontrolling interest in one or more subsidiaries 
accordingly  we do not anticipate that the initial application of sfas no 
will have an impact on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although we currently bill for our products and services mostly in us dollars  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
a strengthening of the dollar could make our products and services less competitive in foreign markets and therefore could reduce our revenues 
we are billed by and pay substantially all of our vendors in us dollars 
in the future  an increased portion of our revenues and costs may be denominated in foreign currencies 
to date  exchange rate fluctuations have had little impact on our operating results 
we do not enter into derivative instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
our investment portfolio  consisting of fixed rate financial institution obligations at december   is subject to interest rate risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio
