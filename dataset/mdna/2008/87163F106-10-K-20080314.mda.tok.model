introduction we provide an integrated suite of services to wireless telecommunications operators that meet the evolving technology requirements of the wireless industry 
these services include technology interoperability services 
we operate one of the largest wireless data clearinghouses globally  enabling the accurate invoicing and settlement of domestic and global wireless roaming telephone calls and wireless data events 
we also provide sms and mms routing and translation services between operators 
in addition  we have expanded our mobile data solutions to include interactive video and mobile broadband solutions  prepaid applications and value added roaming services 
network services 
through our ss network  we connect disparate wireless operator networks and enable access to intelligent network database services like caller id and provide translation and routing services to support the establishment and delivery of telephone calls 
ss is the telecommunications industry s standard network signaling protocol used by substantially all operators to enable critical telecommunications functions such as line busy signals  toll free calling services and caller id 
number portability services 
our leading number portability services are used by many wireless operators  including most domestic operators  to enable wireless subscribers to switch service providers while keeping the same telephone number 
we also provide these services to all canadian wireless operators  and we expect to begin providing number porting services in singapore in the second half of call processing services 
we provide wireless operators with global call handling  signaling and fraud management solutions that allow wireless subscribers from one operator to make and accept telephone calls while roaming on another operator s network 
enterprise solutions 
our enterprise wireless data management platform allows operators to offer large corporate customers reporting and analysis tools to manage telecom related expenses 
off network database queries 
we provide our network customers with access to various third party intelligent network databases 

table of contents the completion of the bsg wireless acquisition has resulted in an expansion of our clearinghouse capabilities in europe  asia and the middle east and the expansion of our integrated suite of services to include financial settlement services 
bsg wireless provides financial settlement services to gsm operators worldwide 
bsg wireless financial settlement services support the efficient and timely payment of roaming related charges by wireless operators to their roaming network partners across domestic and international boundaries 
value added roaming services 
bsg wireless provides a suite of ancillary value added roaming services to its customers  including re rating  invoicing  reporting  tariff maintenance  inter working services  tap generation  conversion and affinity program services 
revenues most of our revenues are transaction based and derived from long term contracts  typically with terms averaging three years in duration 
from time to time  if a contract expires and we have not previously negotiated a new contract or renewal with the customer  we continue to provide services under the terms of the expired contract as we negotiate new agreements or renewals 
for example  we are currently providing services under several contracts with verizon that expired in october while we negotiate the terms of new agreements 
most of the services and solutions we offer to our customers are based on applications  network connectivity and technology platforms owned and operated by us 
we also generate revenues through the sale of software licenses  hardware and professional services 
we generate our revenues through the sale of our technology interoperability services  network services  number portability services  call processing services and enterprise solutions to telecommunications operators throughout the world 
in order to encourage higher customer transaction volumes  we generally negotiate tiered and flat rate pricing schedules with our customers based on certain established transaction volume levels 
as a result  the average per transaction fee for many of our products has declined over time as customers have increasingly used our services and transaction volumes have grown 
we expect this trend to continue 
generally  there is also a slight increase in wireless roaming telephone usage and corresponding revenues in the high travel months of the second and third fiscal quarters 
future increases or decreases in revenues are dependent on many factors  such as industry subscriber growth  with few of these factors known in advance 
from time to time  specific events such as customer contract renewals at different terms  a customer contract termination  a customer s decision to change technologies or to provide solutions in house  will be known to us and then we can estimate their impact on our revenues 
set forth below is a brief description of our primary service offerings and associated revenue recognition technology interoperability services 
we operate one of the largest wireless clearinghouses globally  enabling the accurate invoicing and settlement of domestic and global wireless roaming telephone calls and wireless data events 
we also provide sms and mms routing and translation services between operators 
wireless operators send data records to our service platforms for processing  aggregation  translation and distribution among operators 
we primarily generate revenues by charging per transaction processing fees based on the number of data messaging records provided to us by wireless operators for our wireless roaming clearinghouse and sms and mms routing services 
we recognize revenues at the time the transactions are processed 
over time  we expect the average per transaction fee for certain services to continue to decline as a result of our volume based and service bundling pricing strategy for most of our offerings as well as competitive pricing pressure 
with our acquisition of ithl  we provide mobile data solutions that include interactive video and mobile broadband solutions  prepaid applications and value added roaming services 
some of these solutions contain multiple product and service elements which may include software and hardware products  as well as installation services  post contract customer support and training 
in those cases  we recognize revenues in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under sop  revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is probable 

table of contents network services 
through our ss network  we connect disparate wireless operator networks and enable access to intelligent network database services such as caller id 
we also provide translation and routing services to support the delivery and establishment of telephone calls 
ss is the telecommunications industry s standard network signaling protocol used by substantially all operators to enable critical telecommunications functions such as line busy signals  toll free calling services and caller id 
we primarily generate revenues by charging either per transaction or fixed processing fees determined by expected customer volumes 
in addition  our customers pay monthly connection fees based on the number of network connections as well as the number of switches with which a customer communicates 
the per transaction fees are based on the number of intelligent network messages and intelligent network database queries made through our network and are recognized as revenues at the time the transactions are processed 
over time  we expect the average per transaction fee for certain services will continue to decline as a result of our volume based and service bundling pricing strategy and competitive pricing pressures 
number portability services 
we provide number portability services to the wireless industry 
when wireless subscribers choose to change operators but keep their existing telephone number  the former operator must send the subscribers information to the new operator 
our services perform the necessary processing between the two operators to allow the subscribers to change service providers while keeping their existing telephone number 
we primarily generate revenues by charging per transaction processing fees  monthly fixed fees and fees for customer implementations 
we recognize processing revenues at the time the transactions and services are processed 
we recognize monthly fixed fees as revenues on a monthly basis as the services are performed 
we defer revenues and incremental customer specific costs related to customer implementations and recognize these fees and costs on a straight line basis over the shorter of the life of the initial customer agreement or the period remaining until the amended contract end date for those contracts terminated early 
call processing services 
we provide wireless operators global call handling  signaling and fraud management solutions that allow wireless subscribers from one operator to make and accept calls while roaming on another operator s network 
we primarily generate revenues by charging per transaction processing fees based on the number of validation  authorization and other call processing messages generated by wireless subscribers 
we recognize processing fee revenues at the time the transactions are processed 
enterprise solutions services 
our enterprise wireless data management platform allows operators to offer large corporate customers reporting and analysis tools to manage telecom related expenses 
we primarily generate revenues by charging per subscriber fees 
we recognize these revenues at the time the service is performed 
we expect a continued decline in these revenues as customers migrate off of our wireless data management platform 
off network database queries 
through interconnection with other operator networks  we have access to other service providers databases that support caller id and toll free routing 
if one of our customers uses our network to access another service provider s database  we are charged fees for access to that database 
we pass these charges onto our customers  with little or no margin  based upon the charges we receive from these database providers 
we recognize revenues at the time the transaction is performed 
over time  these revenues are expected to continue to decline as customers seek direct connections with the database providers 
costs and expenses our costs and expenses consist of cost of operations  sales and marketing  general and administrative and depreciation and amortization 
cost of operations includes data processing costs  network costs  royalty costs  hardware costs  personnel costs associated with service implementation  training and customer care and off network database query charges 

table of contents sales and marketing includes personnel costs  advertising costs  trade show costs and relationship marketing costs 
general and administrative consists primarily of research and development expenses  a portion of the expenses associated with our facilities  internal management expenses  business development expenses  and expenses for finance  legal  human resources and other administrative departments 
in addition  we incur significant service development costs 
these costs  which are primarily personnel  relate to technology creation  enhancement and maintenance of new and existing services 
historically  most of these costs are expensed and recorded as general and administrative expenses 
the capitalized portion  which is recorded as capitalized software costs  relates to costs incurred during the application development stage for the new service offerings and significant service enhancements 
depreciation and amortization relate primarily to our property and equipment including our ss network  infrastructure facilities related to information management and other intangible assets recorded in purchase accounting

technology interoperability services revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase in revenues was primarily due to organic volume growth in our wireless data clearinghouse services  sms interoperability  mobile data roaming services and the addition of revenues from our acquisition of ithl of million for the year ended december  as compared to million in during the preparation of our annual financial statements  we discovered a customer billing error related to one of our services 
as a result  we determined that our revenues were overstated during the period from october to september by million  of which million related to the fourth quarter of we reviewed the impact of the error on the fourth quarter of and through the third quarter of and concluded that the cumulative impact of the error was not material to the previously reported quarters 
as a result  we recorded the full amount of the error in the fourth quarter of network services revenues were million for both the years ended december  and this reflects the migration off our services platform by certain customers and price concessions commensurate with our volume based and service bundling pricing strategy for certain of our services and a competitive pricing environment 
during  two or our ss customers completed the process of replacing our ss network solution  resulting in a reduction of network services revenues by million 
number portability services revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower port center activity in addition to price concessions from contract renewals concluded in late and early  partially offset by revenue from new services offered to canadian operators 
call processing services revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for this increase primarily results from increased international roaming volumes driving increased demand for our signaling solutions services  offset by a reduction of our legacy fraud related services 
enterprise solutions services revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease in revenues was primarily due to a lower number of subscribers on our enterprise wireless data management platform 
we expect this decline to continue 
off network database queries revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease in revenues was primarily driven by customers moving to direct access and billing arrangements with third party intelligent network database providers 
we pass these off network database query fees onto our customers  with little or no margin  based upon the charges we receive from the third party database providers

this replacement has resulted in the reduction of network services revenues by million 
number portability services revenues decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower port center activity related to the sprint migration

the senior credit facility also requires compliance with financial covenants  including a maximum ratio of total indebtedness to consolidated ebitda 
prior senior credit facility in february  we entered into our prior senior credit facility  which provided for aggregate borrowings of up to million 
the facility was comprised of a revolving credit facility of up to million in revolving credit loans and letters of credit with the funds available for general corporate purposes including working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and a term b loan facility of million in term loans 
borrowings under the prior senior credit facility bore interest at a floating rate  which can be either a base rate  or at our option  a libor rate  plus an applicable margin 
we used the million of borrowings under the senior credit facility in combination with the net proceeds from our initial public offering to repay our previous senior credit facility  to pay related transaction fees and expenses and to effect a tender offer for million of our senior subordinated notes due on august   we entered into an amended and restated senior credit facility 
senior subordinated notes due on august   we completed a private offering of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due interest on the notes accrues at the rate of per annum and is payable semi annually in arrears on february and august  commencing on february  the net proceeds were used to repurchase million of our outstanding senior subordinated notes due  and to pay the related prepayment premium and costs of debt issuance 
the remaining funds were held for the redemption of the million of senior subordinated notes due  not tendered in august  plus expected payment of related premium of approximately million

effect of inflation inflation generally affects us by increasing our cost of labor  equipment and new materials 
we do not believe that inflation has had any material effect on our results of operations during the years ended december  and non gaap financial measures ebitda we determine ebitda by adding interest expense  net  income taxes  depreciation and amortization to net income loss 
we present ebitda because we believe that ebitda provides useful information regarding our operating results 
reconciliations of both net income loss and cash flows from operations to ebitda are presented in the financial tables contained herein 
we rely on ebitda as a measure to review and assess the operating performance of our company 
we also use ebitda to compare our current operating results with corresponding periods and with the operating results of other companies in our industry 
we believe that it is useful to investors to provide disclosures of our operating results on the same basis as that used by our management 
we also believe that it can assist investors in comparing our performance to that of other companies on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation  amortization  interest or taxes  which do not directly affect our operating performance 
in addition  we also utilize ebitda as a measure of our liquidity and our ability to meet our debt service obligations and satisfy our debt covenants  which are partially based on ebitda 
ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for net income  cash flows from operating activities and other consolidated income or cash flows statement data prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
some of these limitations are ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  
table of contents ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  ebitda does not reflect the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our debt  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  ebitda does not reflect income taxes or the cash requirements for any tax payments  and other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda differently than we do  thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure because of these limitations  ebitda should not be considered a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as a measure of performance in compliance with gaap 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda only supplementally 
see our consolidated statements of income and our consolidated statements of cash flows included in our financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from six categories technology interoperability services  network services  number portability services  call processing services  enterprise solutions and off network database queries 
the revenue recognition policy for each of these areas is described under revenues above 
due to our billing cycles  which for some of our products lag as much as days after the calendar month in which the services are rendered  we estimate the amounts of unbilled revenue each reporting period 
our estimates are based on recent volume and pricing trends adjusted for material changes in contracted service  because actual information is not available immediately 
based on a retrospective review of our actual billings compared to our estimates  our estimates have been reasonable 
historically  our estimates have approximated our actual subsequently billed revenue 
unanticipated changes in volume and pricing trends or material changes in contracted service could adversely affect our estimates of unbilled revenue 
this estimate is critical to our financial statements because it impacts revenue and amounts recorded as accounts receivable on our balance sheet 
as of december  and  our estimated unbilled revenues were million and million  respectively 
a change in our estimate would result in either an increase or decrease in revenues and accounts receivable of approximately million and million for the period ending december  and  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay their invoices to us in full 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable balance  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
a portion of this analysis is dependent on our ability to gather reliable information about our customers specific circumstances 
as part of our analysis  we review significant invoices that are past due to determine if an allowance is necessary based on the risk category using the factors 
table of contents described above 
based on the circumstances  we place each customer into a risk category and assign reserve percentages between and 
our estimates of allowances for doubtful accounts have tracked well with our actual experience of customers who are unable to pay their invoices in full 
however  uncollectible accounts that are not identified or properly assessed in our review could have a significant impact on our bad debt provision 
in addition  if our customers financial condition or the economy in general deteriorates  we may need to increase these allowances for doubtful accounts 
excluding all risk categories that are reserved at  a change in each one of our risk categories would cause our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and our bad debt expense for the year then ended to change by million 
because we perform our analysis and establish reserves on a customer by customer basis  we generally do not record a general reserve 
however  if we were to apply a general reserve of to our unreserved accounts receivable balance  it would increase our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and our bad debt expense for the year then ended by approximately million 
allowance for credit memos we maintain a general reserve based on our historical credit memo activity 
in addition  we establish credit memo reserves resulting from specific customer matters 
this allowance is recorded as a direct reduction of accounts receivable and revenues 
since our allowances for credit memos are derived in large part from specific customer matters  our estimates have tracked well with our actual credit memo experience 
if our billing errors or discrepancies are not resolved satisfactorily or our customers disputes over billing are not resolved satisfactorily  increases to the allowance would be required 
as of december   our allowance for credit memos totaled million 
if our allowance for credit memos  including identified specific customer matters  changed by  our allowance for credit memos and revenues would change by approximately million 
impairment losses on long lived assets we review our long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangibles with definite lives for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
we also evaluate the useful life of our assets each reporting period  and if deemed to be shorter than originally estimated  would result in an increase in our annual depreciation and or amortization expense 
we have not had reason to adjust our estimated lives on these assets 
the impairment review consists of a comparison of the carrying value of the assets with the assets expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest costs 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is deemed to not be recoverable if it exceeds the sum of its undiscounted cash flows 
estimates of expected future cash flows are management s best estimate based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  asset impairment charges may be required 
management continues to evaluate overall industry and company specific circumstances and conditions to identify indicators of impairment 
no impairment was recognized for the year ended december  impairment losses on goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
our evaluation of goodwill is measured by a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of our reporting unit  using a discounted cash flow model  with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of our reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill 
estimates of expected future cash flows represent management s best estimate based 
table of contents on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  an impairment loss may be required to be recognized 
management will continue to evaluate overall industry and company specific circumstances and conditions as necessary 
no impairment was recognized for the year ended december  restructuring we have made estimates of the costs to be incurred as part of our various restructuring plans 
in february  we completed a restructuring plan in our marketing group resulting in the termination of employees 
as a result  we incurred million in severance related costs and made payments for the same amount in in january  we completed a restructuring plan resulting in the closure of our oklahoma office  the elimination of certain executive positions  and the termination of employees 
as a result  we incurred million in severance related costs and million in costs associated with the lease termination of our corporate aircraft 
in june  we committed to restructuring plan affecting our technology development and support groups 
we estimated that the plan would result in the elimination of employees over the remainder of the year 
as a result  we accrued million in severance related costs 
during the third and fourth quarter of  a higher than expected level of attrition among the employees impacted by the offshoring plan resulted in a reduction of our severance liability of million 
as of december   the balance in the restructuring accrual was million 
we expect to pay the remainder of the liabilities relating to the restructurings by the second quarter of the balance in this account at december  continues to represent our best estimate 
loss contingencies we are involved in asserted and unasserted claims  which arise in the ordinary course of our business 
we routinely evaluate whether a loss is probable  and if so  whether it can be estimated 
estimates are based on similar case law matters  consultation with subject matter experts and information obtained through negotiations with counter parties 
as such  accurately depicting the outcome of pending litigation requires considerable judgment and is subject to material differences on final settlement 
accruals for probable losses are recorded in accrued expenses or as a part of our allowance for credit memos if the dispute relates to a customer matter 
if our assessment of the probability is inaccurate  we may need to record additional accruals or reduce recorded accruals later 
in addition  we may need to adjust our estimates of the probable loss amounts as further information is obtained or we consider settlements 
historically  we have had few changes in estimates for these accruals 
the most significant claims are as follows on august   we filed a complaint seeking injunctive relief and damages in hillsborough county  florida against electronic data systems corporation eds and eds information services llc alleging a breach of contract  tortious interference with prospective business relations and unfair competition 
this complaint was based on our discovery in the second quarter of that eds was offering to provide clearing services to one of our customers when the customer s contract with syniverse expires in we believe this offer to provide clearing services to that customer constitutes a breach of certain non compete obligations of eds contained in the asset purchase agreement between eds and us 
on august   the circuit court of the th judicial circuit for the state of florida granted our motion for a temporary injunction and enjoined the eds defendants from selling the assets of their european subsidiaries unless the prospective purchaser assumed the non compete obligations of eds 
the injunction is conditioned upon syniverse providing a million surety bond  which we have provided 
we intend to continue to pursue this matter vigorously 
on april   we were served with a petition for declaratory judgment filed by billing concepts  inc d b a bsg clearing solutions bci in texas state court asking the court to find  in pertinent part  that bci s offering of services competitive to syniverse in the united states and north america is not subject to the restrictions imposed on bsg germany 
we contested the petition and filed an appropriate response in accordance with local court rules 
this action was dismissed on december  
table of contents purchase accounting we have made estimates of the fair values of the assets acquired from our various acquisitions  based primarily on appraisals from third parties and also based on certain internally generated information 
if the subsequent actual and updated projections of the underlying business activity change as compared to the underlying assumptions and projections used to develop these fair values  then we could experience impairment losses  as described above 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain of these assets and these lives were used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  then additional depreciation or amortization expense could be incurred on an annual basis 
we have not made any changes in these areas 
if the estimates of the economic lives on the definite lived intangible assets acquired were reduced by one year  our amortization expense would increase by approximately million 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires companies to account for such stock based compensation using a fair value method and recognize the expense in the consolidated statement of income 
sfas r requires companies to estimate potential forfeitures of stock grants and adjust compensation cost recorded accordingly 
due to the minimal number of forfeitures we have experienced during the limited life of our option plans  our forfeiture rate is not material to our fair value calculation  therefore  we currently use actual forfeitures in our calculations 
the fair values of stock option grants are amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the grants 
the fair value for these options is estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
option pricing models require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the option and price volatility 
if actual results or future changes in estimates differ significantly from our current estimates  stock based compensation could increase or decrease 
for further discussion of our stock based compensation  refer to note in our consolidated financial statements 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations  as permitted by financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
income taxes on january  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  resulting in a change to our reserve for uncertain tax positions which was accounted for as a million cumulative effect adjustment to decrease the beginning balance of retained earnings on our balance sheet 
no increases or decreases were made to this reserve during the remainder of we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of income tax expense 
accrued interest and penalties were zero during the year ended we review our deferred tax assets on a regular basis to evaluate their recoverability based on projections of the turnaround timing of our deferred tax liabilities  projections of future taxable income  and tax planning strategies that we might employ to utilize such assets  including net operating loss carryforwards 
unless it is more likely than not that we will recover such assets through the above means  we establish a valuation allowance 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets primarily associated with foreign and state net operating losses and capital loss carry forwards 
the valuation allowance also includes amounts recorded for certain net deferred tax assets associated with the bsg wireless acquisition 
we file our tax returns on a calendar year basis 
as of december   we had federal nols net operating losses and capital losses totaling approximately million and million  respectively  many of which we succeeded to as a result of our merger with syniverse brience 
all of our nols remain subject to examination and adjustment by the internal revenue service 

table of contents as of december   our consolidated group had net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  for us federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  imposes an annual limitation on the use of a corporation s nols if the corporation undergoes an ownership change during a three year testing period 
the sale of our shares in november  caused an ownership change within the meaning of section g 
this ownership change will subject our nols to an annual use limitation that may restrict our ability to use them to offset our taxable income 
we do not believe this ownership change will materially limit our utilization of the nols 
in general  an ownership change occurs if  on any testing date  the beneficial ownership of the corporation by one or more percent shareholders has increased  in the aggregate  by more than percentage points over the respective lowest ownership percentages of such percent shareholders during the testing period preceding such date 
the change in our share ownership caused by the november  offering caused the aggregate change during the testing period to exceed the percentage point threshold 
as a result  the maximum amount of pre change nols that can be used to offset our taxable income in any given post change year will be limited to the product of the value of our equity immediately prior to the ownership change  subject to certain adjustments  and the applicable federal long term tax exempt interest rate published by the internal revenue service 
future changes in the direct or indirect beneficial ownership of our common stock  which may be beyond our control  could trigger another ownership change and thus further limit  or possibly eliminate altogether  our ability to use these nols in subsequent taxable years 
additionally  our consolidated group succeeded to approximately million of our nols pursuant to a state law merger with brience  inc  now known as syniverse brience llc  in july  the merger was treated as a tax free reorganization under the code 
if the internal revenue service were to challenge successfully the reorganization or otherwise successfully disallow the use of such nols  the amount of our consolidated group s nols would be substantially reduced 
all of our consolidated group s nols remain subject to examination and adjustment by the internal revenue service 
in addition  the nols acquired from brience inc are subject to the separate return limitation rules under the consolidated return regulations 
as a result  these nols generally can be utilized only to offset income from brience inc and other members of its consolidated group of corporations at the time the losses were generated  or their successors 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas is effective january  on february   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp which delays the effective date of sfas no 
for one year  for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
sfas no 
and fsp are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the partial adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this standard permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the fair value option permits a company to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
a company will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings after adoption 
sfas will be effective for us beginning on january  we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas could have on our financial position or results of operations

sfas r provides revised guidance on how acquirers recognize and measure the consideration transferred  identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  noncontrolling interests  and goodwill acquired in a business combination 
sfas r also expands required disclosures surrounding the nature and financial effects of business combinations 
sfas r is effective  on a prospective basis  for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas r on our financial position and results of operations 
contractual obligations and commitments as of december   our contractual obligations consist of our debt  operating leases and pension plan liabilities associated with our acquisition of bsg wireless 
our contracts with certain of our technology service providers  which range in length from months to months  have no minimum payment requirements 
contractual obligations total less than year to years to years more than years dollars in thousands long term debt obligations including interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations pension obligation total the interest rate on the term loans is at plus libor for the us denominated portion and plus euribor for the euro denominated portion  with libor assumed to be and euribor assumed to be amounts represent primarily purchase obligations for equipment and services 
certain of these obligations represent fees that we would incur if we were to cancel or terminate the underlying purchase agreement 
represents estimated obligations from a noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan assumed by us as part of the acquisition of bsg wireless off balance sheet arrangements we have also used off balance sheet financing in recent years primarily in the form of operating leases for facility space and some equipment leasing and we expect to continue these practices 
we do not use any other type of joint venture or special purpose entities that would create off balance sheet financing 
we believe that our decision to lease our office space is similar to that used by many other companies of our size and does not have a material impact to our financial statements 
forward looking statements we have made forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of in this report

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our senior credit facility 
our senior credit facility is variable rate debt 
interest rate changes therefore generally do not affect the market value of such debt but do impact the amount of our interest payments and  therefore  our future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
as of december   we had million of variable rate debt outstanding on our senior credit facility 
holding other variables constant  including levels of indebtedness  a one percentage point increase in interest rates on our variable debt would have had an estimated impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows for the next year of approximately million 
under the terms of the senior credit facility at least of our funded debt must bear interest that is effectively fixed 
as a result  we may from time to time be required to enter into interest rate protection agreements establishing a fixed maximum interest rate with respect to a portion of our total indebtedness 
as of december  and december   we had variable rate debt of approximately million and million  respectively 
foreign currency market risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk in certain circumstances 
certain of our international clients currently pay us in currencies other than the us dollar 
foreign currency fluctuations had an immaterial impact on our december  financial position and results of operations 
this could change in future periods due to our acquisitions of ithl and bsg wireless 
these companies have contractual arrangements with multiple customers that are collectible and payable in currencies other than the functional currency  which could result in significant currency gains or losses 
at this time  we have not entered into any arrangements to hedge our risks from foreign currency
