introduction in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a  the general financial condition and results of operations for idacorp  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  idacorp and idaho power company and its subsidiary collectively  ipc are discussed 
idacorp is a holding company formed in whose principal operating subsidiary is ipc 
idacorp is subject to the provisions of the public utility holding company act of  which provides certain access to books and records to the federal energy regulatory commission ferc and state utility regulatory commissions and imposes certain record retention and reporting requirements on idacorp 
ipc is an electric utility with a service territory covering approximately  square miles in southern idaho and eastern oregon 
ipc is regulated by the ferc and the state regulatory commissions of idaho and oregon 
ipc is the parent of idaho energy resources co  ierco a joint venturer in bridger coal company  which supplies coal to the jim bridger generating plant owned in part by ipc 
idacorp s other subsidiaries include idacorp financial services  inc ifs  an investor in affordable housing and other real estate investments  ida west energy company ida west  an operator of small hydroelectric generation projects that satisfy the requirements of purpa  and idacorp energy ie  a marketer of energy commodities  which wound down operations in in the second quarter of  idacorp management designated the operations of idacorp technologies  inc iti and idacomm  inc

table of contents executive overview financial results a summary of idacorp s net income and earnings per diluted share for the last three years is as follows net income average outstanding shares diluted s earnings per diluted share the key factors affecting the change in idacorp s net income for include amounts shown are net of income taxes discontinued operations contributed million to earnings in as compared to million in  a decrease of per diluted share 
on july   idacorp completed the sale of all of the outstanding common stock of iti to idatech uk limited  a wholly owned subsidiary of investec group investments uk limited 
on february   idacorp completed the sale of all of the outstanding common stock of idacomm to american fiber systems  inc net loss at the holding company was million  a decrease of million  or per diluted share  from the prior year 
the decrease in net loss is attributable to a decrease in administration expenses resulting from the sale of iti and idacomm 
ifs contributed million less to earnings than in the prior year  a decrease of per diluted share 
the decline in earnings is attributable to higher investment amortization expense and lower tax benefits due to a reduction in the amount of new investments combined with the continued aging of existing investments 
ipc s net income for the last three years is as follows net income the key factors affecting ipc s net income for include amounts shown are net of income taxes increased retail sales contributed million to earnings in warmer and drier conditions in led to higher residential  commercial and industrial usage  as well as higher irrigation loads as compared to the prior year 
ipc continued to experience moderate customer growth  with the average number of general business customers increasing  over  an increase of percent 
increased costs to supply power  net of rate adjustments  reduced earnings by million in poor hydroelectric generating conditions in increased ipc s reliance on typically more expensive thermal generation and purchased power  and reduced wholesale sales 
ipc s hydroelectric generation contributed only percent of total system generation in as compared to percent in increases in other o m expenses reduced earnings by million in compared to the increase is primarily the result of increases in third party transmission costs  regulatory commission expenses  maintenance expenses for ipc s coal fired generation facilities  hydroelectric license and inspection costs  and the fixed cost adjustment accrual which began in gain on sales of excess so emission allowances was million in compared to million in 
table of contents non gaap financial measures the following discussion includes financial information prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  as well as one additional financial measure  electric utility margin  that is considered a non gaap financial measure under sec rules 
generally  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a company s financial performance  financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
the most directly comparable gaap financial measure to electric utility margin is operating income 
the presentation of electric utility margin is intended to supplement the information available to investors for evaluating ipc s operating performance 
when viewed in conjunction with ipc s operating income  electric utility margin provides a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting ipc s business  and users can assess which information best suits their needs 
however  this measure is not intended to replace operating income  or any other measure calculated in accordance with gaap  as an indicator of operating performance 
ipc s management uses electric utility margin  in addition to gaap measures  to determine whether ipc is collecting the appropriate amount of energy costs from its customers to allow recovery of operating costs 
electric utility margin also provides both management and investors with a better understanding of the effects of regulatory mechanisms on ipc s operating income 
the primary limitation associated with this measure is that ipc s electric utility margin may not be comparable to other companies electric utility margins 
however  management uses electric utility margin as an internal tool for evaluating and conducting the business  and is therefore unburdened by this limitation 
the calculations of ipc s electric utility margin for the last three years are as follows general business revenue pca amortization other revenues amortization irrigation load reduction rate case tax settlement total power supply costs off system sales purchased power fuel pca deferral total third party transmission expense other revenues excluding dsm electric utility margin electric utility margin as a percentage of total general business revenue  pca amortization and other revenues amortization the decline in electric utility margin as a percentage of total general business revenue  pca amortization and other revenues amortization is a result of an increase in the ten percent sharing component of the pca due to below normal hydroelectric production and the negative impact of the load growth adjustment rate lgar mechanism 
system load in was million mwh greater than the base loads established in the general rate case 
this represents an increase of  mwh over total system loads 
the mwh increases  when combined with an increase in the lgar in april from per mwh to per mwh  result in a decline in a component of the pca deferral as compared to this decline reduced electric utility margin by million 

table of contents the following table reconciles electric utility margin to electric utility operating income gaap for the last three years electric utility margin other operations and maintenance excluding third party transmission expense gain on sale of emission allowances depreciation taxes other than income taxes operating income electric utility gaap business strategy idacorp is focusing on a strategy that emphasizes ipc as idacorp s core business 
ipc continues to experience moderate customer growth in its service area  and this corporate strategy recognizes that ipc must make substantial investments in infrastructure to ensure adequate supply and reliable service 
ipc s regulatory plans in include finalizing the general rate case as well as additional initiatives designed to speed recovery of the financial and operating costs of new facilities and system improvements 
the strategy includes seeking timely rate recovery in both the idaho and oregon jurisdictions 
the regulatory strategy includes filing for recovery of the investment and operating costs of ipc s new mw natural gas fired peaking plant expected to go on line in april  pursuing a power cost adjustment mechanism in oregon  and potential general rate case filings in both idaho and oregon 
ifs and ida west remain components of the corporate strategy 
this strategy also included the sale of non core businesses 
idacorp completed the sales of iti on july   and idacomm on february regulatory matters general rate case settlement on june   ipc filed an application with the ipuc requesting an average rate increase of approximately percent  or million annually  for its idaho customers in order to begin recovery of its capital investments and higher operating costs 
ipc also requested a per mwh lgar  which adjusts the power supply costs ipc includes in the pca for differences between actual load and the load used in calculating base rates 
the existing lgar is per mwh 
the impact of the new lgar on ipc will ultimately be determined by future load changes 
the parties to the proceeding reached a settlement that includes an average annual increase of percent approximately million annually 
the parties also agreed in the settlement to make a good faith effort to develop a mechanism to adjust or replace the current lgar 
as an interim solution  the parties have agreed to use the lgar of per mwh recommended by the ipuc staff in its testimony filed december   but to apply it to only fifty percent of the load growth occurring during each month within the april march pca year 
the parties also agreed in the settlement to participate in a good faith discussion regarding a forecast test year methodology that balances the auditing concerns of the ipuc staff and intervenors with ipc s need for timely rate relief 
the parties agreed that such a methodology would begin with auditable numbers from which projections would be made for the test year 
ipc filed a settlement stipulation with the ipuc on january  the settlement is subject to approval by the ipuc 
the parties have requested in the stipulation that the new rates become effective no later than march   but ipc is unable to predict what relief the ipuc will grant or when the ipuc will issue its final order 

table of contents power cost adjustment on june   ipc implemented its annual power cost adjustment pca  which resulted in a million  or percent on average  increase in the rates of idaho customers 
the increase in rates is a direct result of significantly below normal winter precipitation and deteriorated stream flow conditions during the first half of in years where water is plentiful and ipc can fully utilize its extensive hydroelectric system  power production costs are lower and ipc can pass those benefits to its customers in the form of rate reductions 
in years when water is in short supply  as it was this past winter  the higher costs of supplying power by other means are shared with ipc s customers 
emission allowances in and early  ipc sold  so emission allowances for a total of million  after subtracting transaction fees 
the sales proceeds allocated to the idaho jurisdiction were approximately million million net of tax  assuming a tax rate of approximately percent 
on may   the ipuc approved a stipulation that allowed ipc to retain ten percent as a shareholder benefit with the remaining percent plus a carrying charge recorded as a customer benefit 
this customer benefit is included in ipc s pca calculations as a credit to the pca true up balance and is currently reflected in pca rates during the june   through may   pca rate year 
during  ipc sold  so emission allowances for a total of million  after subtracting transaction fees 
the sales proceeds to be allocated to the idaho jurisdiction are approximately million million net of tax  assuming a tax rate of approximately percent 
on january   a workshop was held to discuss whether the customer share of the idaho jurisdictional portion of the sales proceeds should once again be included as a pca credit or used to reduce investment costs in wind development  green tags  or other options that would provide longer term customer benefits 
because the workshop participants were unable to reach a consensus regarding the use of the so emission allowance proceeds  the ipuc determined that the case would proceed under modified procedure 
written comments were due february  the bulk of ipc s accumulated excess emission allowances were sold during the period 
ipc currently has approximately  excess emission allowances and anticipates accumulating a similar amount of excess allowances annually for the near future 
tighter emission restrictions are expected in the long term  which may cause ipc to use more emission allowances for its own requirements and reduce the annual amount of excess allowances 
record system peaks ipc s service territory experienced record setting high temperatures during july due to these weather conditions and continued customer growth  ipc set three new all time system peaks between july and july   with the highest   mw  being set on july  the previous hourly system peak of  mw was set in although ipc was able to meet all of its load requirements during these periods of increased demand  all available resources of ipc s system were fully committed during several heavy load periods during the summer 
the record setting temperatures also contributed to numerous wildfires throughout ipc s service area 
although the wildfires damaged or destroyed several distribution and transmission structures  the wildfires did not have a material impact to earnings in the all time winter peak demand is  mw set on january  the previous hourly system winter peak of  mw was set in integrated resource plan ipc filed its irp with the ipuc in september and with the opuc in october the irp previewed ipc s load and resource situation for the next twenty years  analyzed potential supply side and demand side options and identified near term and long term actions 
the ipuc accepted the irp in march the opuc acknowledged the irp in september with the stipulation that ipc not commit to the construction of a mw pulverized coal resource  identified to come on line in  until ipc presents an update of the irp to the opuc no later than june with its acceptance of the irp  the ipuc requested that ipc align the submittal of its next irp with those submitted by other utilities 
to comply with this request  ipc intends to provide an update on the status of the irp to both the ipuc and opuc no later than june and file a new irp in june 
table of contents the near term action plan in the irp indicated initial commitments to the construction of a coal fired base load resource would be necessary before the end of in order for a project to be on line in in order to meet this schedule  ipc screened and evaluated coal fired resources in and the results of this evaluation indicated construction costs had escalated substantially since resource cost estimates were prepared for the irp 
due to such escalating construction costs  potential permitting issues  and continued uncertainty surrounding future greenhouse gas laws and regulations  ipc determined that coal fired generation was not the best technology to meet its resource needs in ipc plans to construct a natural gas fired combined cycle combustion turbine located closer to its load center in southern idaho 
ipc continues to evaluate coal fired resource opportunities  including expansion of its jointly owned facilities  clean coal technologies and potential power purchase agreements for future energy needs 
transmission projects ipc and pacificorp are jointly exploring a project  called the gateway west project  to build two kv lines between the jim bridger plant in wyoming and boise 
the lines would be designed to increase electrical transmission capacity across southern idaho in response to increasing customer demand and growth 
if built  it is expected that the majority of the project would be completed between and  depending on the timing of acquisition of rights of way  siting and permitting  and construction sequencing 
ipc estimates that its share of project costs would be between million and billion 
ipc is also exploring alternatives for the construction of a kv line between southwestern idaho and the northwest  named the hemingway boardman line formerly referred to as the idaho northwest line 
if built  the line could run from the proposed hemingway station southwest of boise to a proposed transmission station near boardman  oregon and be in service as early as ipc has received inquiries from other parties about participating in this project 
the proposed gateway west and hemingway boardman transmission projects will be used both by wholesale transmission customers and to serve ipc s native load consistent with ipc s open access transmission tariff oatt 
therefore these facilities will be subject to both the ferc and state public utility commission regulation and rate making policies 
capital requirements and cash flows idacorp estimates that it will spend approximately million on construction expenditures over the next three years  excluding any estimated expenditures for a nominal mw combined cycle combustion turbine expected to be operational in mid and the transmission projects discussed above 
this amount reflects the need for additional resources in order for ipc to supply power to its growing number of customers 
forecasts indicate that internal cash generation after dividends will provide less than the full amount of total capital requirements for through idacorp and ipc expect to continue financing the utility construction program and other capital requirements with internally generated funds and continued reliance on externally financed capital 
the amount of internal cash generation is dependent primarily upon ipc s cash flows from operations  which are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to weather and water conditions and ipc s ability to obtain rate relief to cover its operating costs and provide a return on investment 

table of contents idaho water management issues power generation at the ipc hydroelectric power plants on the snake river is dependent upon the state water rights held by ipc and the long term sustainability of the snake river  tributary spring flows and the eastern snake plain aquifer that is connected to the snake river 
ipc continues to participate in water management issues in idaho that may affect those water rights and resources 
this includes active participation in the snake river basin adjudication  a judicial action initiated in to determine the nature and extent of water use in the snake river basin  judicial and administrative proceedings relating to the conjunctive management of ground and surface water rights  and management and planning processes intended to reverse declining trends in river  spring  and aquifer levels and address the long term water resource needs of the state 
on occasion  resolution of these water management issues involves litigation 
ipc is involved in legal actions regarding not only its water rights but also the water rights of others 
one such action  initiated in the snake river basin adjudication  involves ipc s water rights at the swan falls project on the snake river and several other upstream hydroelectric projects that are the subject of a agreement with the state of idaho known as the swan falls agreement 
ipc also has initiated legal action against the us bureau of reclamation usbr over the interpretation and effect of a contract with the usbr on the operation of the american falls reservoir and the release of water from that reservoir to be used at ipc s downstream hydroelectric projects 
although ipc intends to continue vigorously defending its water rights and although none of the pending water management issues are expected to impact ipc s hydroelectric generation in the near term  ipc cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters or what effect they may have on its consolidated financial positions  results of operations or cash flows 
ipc s ongoing participation in such issues will help ensure that water remains available over the long term for use at ipc s hydroelectric projects on the snake river 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to apply accounting policies and make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates involve judgment with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
management adjusts these estimates based on historical experience and on other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual amounts could materially differ from the estimates 
management believes the following accounting policies and estimates are the most critical to the portrayal of their financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
accounting for rate regulation in order to apply the accounting policies and practices of statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  a regulated company must satisfy the following conditions an independent regulator must set rates  the regulator must set the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory must lack competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
sfas requires companies that meet the above conditions to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in their consolidated financial statements and requires that certain costs be deferred as regulatory assets until matching revenues can be recognized 
similarly  certain items may be deferred as regulatory liabilities and amortized to the income statement as rates to customers are reduced 
ipc follows sfas  and its financial statements reflect the effects of the different rate making principles followed by the jurisdictions regulating ipc 
the primary effect of this policy is that ipc has recorded million of regulatory assets and million of regulatory liabilities at december  while ipc expects to fully recover these regulatory assets from customers through rates and refund these regulatory liabilities to customers through rates  such recovery or refund is subject to final review by the regulatory entities 
if future recovery or refund of these amounts ceases to be probable  or if ipc determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying sfas  ipc would be required to eliminate those regulatory assets or liabilities  unless regulators specify some other means of recovery or refund 
either circumstance could have a material effect on ipc s results of operations and financial position 
pension and other postretirement benefits ipc maintains a qualified defined benefit pension plan covering most employees  an unfunded nonqualified deferred compensation plan for certain senior management employees and directors  and a postretirement medical benefit plan 
the expenses idacorp and ipc record for these plans depend on a number of factors  including the provisions of the plans  changing employee demographics  actual returns on plan assets and several assumptions used in the actuarial valuations upon which pension expense is based 
the key actuarial assumptions that affect expense are the expected long term return on plan assets and the discount rate used in determining future benefit obligations 
management evaluates the actuarial assumptions on an annual basis  taking into account changes in market conditions  trends and future expectations 
estimates of future stock market performance  changes in interest rates and other factors used to develop the actuarial assumptions are uncertain 
actual results could vary significantly from the estimates 
the assumed discount rate is based on reviews of market yields on high quality corporate debt 
specifically  idacorp and ipc utilize data published in the citigroup pension liability index and apply the rates therein against the projected cash outflows of the plans 
the discount rate used to calculate the pension expense will be increased to percent from the percent used in 
table of contents rate of return projections for plan assets are based on historical risk return relationships among asset classes 
the primary measure is the historical risk premium each asset class has delivered versus the return on year us treasury notes 
this historical risk premium is then added to the current yield on year us treasury notes  and the result provides a reasonable prediction of future investment performance 
additional analysis is performed to measure the expected range of returns  as well as worst case and best case scenarios 
based on the current interest rate environment  current rate of return expectations are lower than the nominal returns generated over the past years when interest rates were generally much higher 
gross pension and other postretirement benefit expense for these plans totaled million  million  and million for the three years ended december   and  respectively  including amounts allocated to capitalized labor and amounts deferred as regulatory assets 
for  gross pension expense is expected to total approximately million  which takes into account the increase in the discount rate noted above 
no changes were made to the other key assumptions used in the actuarial calculation 
had different actuarial assumptions been used  pension expense could have varied significantly 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with changes in the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets actuarial assumptions on historical and future pension and postretirement expense discount rate rate of return millions of dollars effect of increase effect of decrease no cash contributions were made to the qualified plan from through  and none are expected in under the non qualified plan  ipc makes payments directly to participants in the plan 
payments are expected to be approximately million in and averaged approximately million per year from to gross postretirement plan contributions are expected to be approximately million in  and averaged million from to please refer to note and note of idacorp s and ipc s consolidated financial statements  which contains additional information about the pension and postretirement plans and the regulatory treatment of pension expense  respectively 
contingent liabilities contingent liabilities are accounted for in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
according to sfas  an estimated loss from a loss contingency is charged to income if a it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated no accrual is recorded but disclosure of the contingency in the notes to the financial statements is required 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 
idacorp and ipc have a number of unresolved issues related to regulatory and legal matters 
if the recognition criteria of sfas have been met  liabilities have been recorded 
estimates of this nature are highly subjective and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been included in the financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are periodically reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable as prescribed under sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas requires that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from an asset is less than the carrying value of the asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
long lived assets that were evaluated in include the following 
table of contents southwest intertie project ipc began developing the southwest intertie project swip in ipc s investment consists predominantly of a federal permit for a specific transmission corridor in nevada and idaho and also private rights of way in idaho 
the swip rights of way extend from midpoint substation in south central idaho through eastern nevada to the dry lake area northeast of las vegas  nevada 
in the bureau of land management granted a five year extension to begin construction of a proposed kv transmission line within the rights of way before december on march   ipc entered into an agreement with white pine energy associates  llc white pine  an affiliate of ls power development  llc  which provides white pine a three year exclusive option to purchase the swip rights of way from ipc 
the option may be exercised in part or as a whole and  if fully exercised  will result in a net pre tax gain to ipc of approximately million 
based on management expectations regarding swip  no impairment has been identified 
impairment of equity method investments ifs has affordable housing investments with a net book value of million at december   and ida west has investments in four joint ventures that own electric power generation facilities 
except for two investments now consolidated in accordance with gaap these investments are accounted for under the equity method of accounting as described in accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
the standard for determining whether impairment must be recorded under apb is whether the investment has experienced a loss in value that is considered an other than temporary decline in value 
impairment analyses on these investments were performed in and no impairment was noted 
these estimates required idacorp to make assumptions about future stream flows  revenues  cash flows and other items that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could vary significantly from the assumptions used  and the impact of such variations could be material 
unbilled revenue ipc s general business revenues include an estimate of electricity delivered to general business customers that has not been billed at the end of the period 
unbilled revenues estimates are dependent upon a number of inputs that require management s judgment 
unbilled revenue is calculated by taking daily estimates of mwhs delivered and applying information from the meter reading schedule to estimate the portion of mwhs delivered that have not been billed 
these unbilled mwhs are allocated to the general business customer classes based on historical data 
ipc then calculates unbilled revenue based on the respective rates of each customer class 
due to the seasonal fluctuations of ipc s load  the amount of unbilled revenue increases during the summer and winter months and decreases during the spring and fall 
income taxes idacorp and ipc account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes and fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
judgment and estimation are used in developing the provision for income taxes and the reporting of tax related assets and liabilities 
the interpretation of tax laws can involve uncertainty  since tax authorities may interpret such laws differently 
actual income taxes could vary from estimated amounts and may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income  cash flows  and tax related assets and liabilities 
results of operations this section of the md a takes a closer look at the significant factors that affected idacorp s and ipc s earnings over the last three years 
in this analysis  the results of are compared to and the results of are compared to the following table presents earnings losses for idacorp and its subsidiaries ipc utility operations idacorp financial services idacorp energy ida west energy holding company expenses discontinued operations total earnings average outstanding shares diluted s earnings per diluted share 
table of contents utility operations operating environment ipc is one of the nation s few investor owned utilities with a predominantly hydroelectric generating base 
because of its reliance on hydroelectric generation  ipc s generation operations can be significantly affected by weather conditions 
the availability of hydroelectric power depends on the amount of snow pack in the mountains upstream of ipc s hydroelectric facilities  springtime snow pack run off  river base flows  spring flows  rainfall and other weather and stream flow management considerations 
during low water years  when stream flows into ipc s hydroelectric projects are reduced  ipc s hydroelectric generation is reduced 
this results in less generation from ipc s resource portfolio hydroelectric  coal fired and gas fired available for off system sales and  most likely  an increased use of purchased power to meet load requirements 
both of these situations a reduction in off system sales and an increased use of more expensive purchased power result in increased power supply costs 
during high water years  increased off system sales and the decreased need for purchased power reduce net power supply costs 
operations plans are developed during the year to provide guidance for generation resource utilization and energy market activities off system sales and power purchases 
the plans incorporate forecasts for generation unit availability  reservoir storage and stream flows  gas and coal prices  customer loads  energy market prices and other pertinent inputs 
consideration is given to when to use ipc s available resources to meet forecast loads and when to transact in the energy market 
the allocation of hydroelectric generation between heavy load and light load hours or calendar periods is considered in development of the operating plans 
this allocation is intended to utilize the flexibility of the hydroelectric system to shift generation to high value periods  while operating within the constraints imposed on the system 
ipc s energy risk management policy  unit operating requirements and other obligations provide the framework for the plans 
stream flow conditions were much lower in than resulting in million mwh generated from ipc s hydroelectric facilities  compared to million mwh in the observed stream flow data released on august   by the national weather service s northwest river forecast center rfc indicated that brownlee reservoir inflow for april through july was million acre feet maf  or percent of the rfc average 
brownlee reservoir inflow for totaled maf  or percent of the rfc average 
storage in selected federal reservoirs upstream of brownlee as of february  was percent of average 
the stream flow forecast released on february  by the rfc predicts that brownlee reservoir inflow for april through july will be maf  or percent of the rfc average 
generation from thermal plants during was higher than due primarily to increased generation to meet increased load requirements 
in addition  the thermal plants were under utilized in due to an unanticipated outage at the boardman plant and a planned outage at the valmy plant  of which ipc owns a ten percent and percent interest  respectively 
both units returned to service in june additionally  the bennett mountain combustion turbine suffered a mechanical failure on july  ipc s investigation revealed that during construction a bolt was negligently installed by a third party 
the bolt came loose  causing extensive mechanical damage 
the plant was down from july through september  total repair costs were approximately million 
in  ipc received reimbursement for the bulk of the total repair costs from its insurance carrier 
with regards to the remaining repair costs  ipc has reached an agreement in principle with the third party  which essentially makes ipc whole 
ipc s system is dual peaking  with the larger peak demand occurring in the summer 
the all time system peak demand is  mw  set on july  the previous hourly system peak of  mw was set in although ipc was able to meet all of its load requirements during these periods of increased demand  all available resources of ipc s system were fully committed during several heavy load periods in the summer 
the all time winter peak demand is  mw set on january  the previous hourly system winter peak of  mw was set in the following table presents ipc s power supply for the last three years mwh hydroelectric thermal total system purchased generation generation generation power total ipc s modeled median annual hydroelectric generation is million mwh  based on hydrologic conditions for the period through and adjusted to reflect the current level of water resource development 
general business revenue the primary influences on electricity sales are weather  customer growth and economic conditions 
extreme temperatures increase sales to customers who use electricity for cooling and heating  and moderate temperatures decrease sales

the following table presents ipc s off system sales for the last three years revenue mwh sold revenue per mwh vs 
in  the mwh volume sold decreased percent and revenues decreased percent 
deteriorated stream flow conditions throughout southern idaho decreased total system generation and electricity available for surplus sales 
revenue decreases from lower sales volumes were moderated by higher prices

in  the mwh volume sold more than doubled and revenues grew percent 
improved stream flow conditions increased total system generation and electricity available for surplus sales 
revenue increases from higher sales volumes were moderated by lower prices caused by abundant energy in the region 
the volume increase was also impacted by early water year indications suggesting continued drought conditions for  prompting ipc to make forward purchases in conformance with its risk management policy that were subsequently sold

table of contents purchased power the following table presents ipc s purchased power expenses and volumes expense mwh purchased cost per mwh purchased vs 
purchased power expense grew two percent in deteriorated system generation  due to poor hydrologic conditions  combined with the second year in a row of record high temperatures and demand during july and august  led to increased purchases 
this increase in purchases was partially offset by a lower overall cost per mwh in during  ipc made forward purchases in conformance with its risk management policy in response to early water year indications that suggested continued drought conditions 
hydrologic conditions for turned out to be more favorable than forecasted and actual market prices ended up being lower than the prices of the forward purchases 
these higher priced forward purchases inflated the cost per mwh that ipc realized for ipc began utilizing financial hedge instruments in in addition to physical forward power transactions for the purpose of mitigating price risk related to conforming to ipc s energy risk management policy  managing ipc s energy portfolio to meet customer load  and reacting to changes in market conditions to minimize net power supply costs

fuel expense the following table presents ipc s fuel expenses and generation at its thermal generating plants fuel expense thermal mwh generated cost per mwh vs 
fuel expense increased million in  as compared to the increase is largely due to an percent rise in average prices accompanied by a five percent increase in mwh volume 
coal fuel expense was up million compared to the increase in coal prices was due to higher market demand and higher rail transportation costs 
generation from the coal fired power plants was up three percent in the increase in generation is attributed to fewer planned and unplanned outages at valmy and boardman than the previous year 
additional generation from combustion turbine plants contributed million to the overall increase in fuel expense in the combustion turbine plants were readily available for dispatch in to meet peak loads and as market conditions warranted 
the bennett mountain plant was not available during the summer of due to a turbine failure 
vs 
the increase in fuel expense was due primarily to a million increase in expense from higher coal and rail transportation costs 
the increased cost of coal was due primarily to higher market demand  and the increased rail transportation costs are primarily driven by higher diesel fuel costs  including an adjustable fuel surcharge 
higher natural gas costs of million also contributed to the increase 
generation from the coal fired power plants was down four percent due to unplanned outages at valmy and boardman

at february   million of commercial paper was outstanding 
both the idacorp facility and the ipc facility have similar terms and conditions 
under the terms of the facilities idacorp and ipc may borrow floating rate advances and eurodollar rate advances 
the floating rate is equal to the higher of i the prime rate announced by wachovia bank or its parent and ii the sum of the federal funds effective rate for such day plus percent per annum  plus  in each case  an applicable margin 
the eurodollar rate is based upon the british bankers association interest settlement rate for deposits in us dollars published on the reuters telerate page successor as adjusted by the applicable reserve requirement for eurocurrency liabilities imposed under regulation d of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  for periods of one  two  three or six months plus the applicable margin 
the margin is based on the applicable company s rating for senior unsecured long term debt securities without third party credit enhancement as provided by moody s and s p  based on the higher of the two ratings 
if the ratings are split between moody s and s p and the differential is two levels or more  the intermediate rating at the midpoint will apply 
if there is no midpoint  the higher of the two intermediate ratings will apply 
the margin for the floating rate advances is zero percent unless the applicable company s rating falls below baa from moody s or bbb from s p  at which time it would equal percent 
the margin for eurodollar rate advances ranges from percent to percent depending upon the credit rating 
in addition to the margin  if the outstanding aggregate credit exposure exceeds percent of the facility amount  idacorp or ipc  as applicable  would pay a utilization fee ranging from percent to percent on outstanding loans depending on the credit rating 
at december   the applicable margin under the idacorp facility and the ipc facility was zero percent for floating rate advances and percent for ipc and percent for idacorp for eurodollar rate advances 
the utilization fee was percent for both companies 
a facility fee  payable quarterly  is calculated on the average daily aggregate commitment of the lenders under the relevant credit facility and is also based on the applicable company s rating from moody s or s p as indicated above 
at december   the facility fee under the idacorp and ipc facilities was percent and percent  respectively 
as a result of the s p ratings downgrade discussed below  as of january   the credit facility fees changed for ipc 
the margin for eurodollar rate advances increased from percent to percent  and the facility fee increased from percent to percent 
all of the other fees discussed above stayed the same for ipc 
idacorp s fees remain unchanged 

table of contents in connection with the issuance of letters of credit  idacorp and ipc  as applicable  must pay i a fee equal to the applicable margin for eurodollar rate advances on the average daily undrawn stated amount under such letters of credit  payable quarterly in arrears  ii a fronting fee at a per annum rate of percent on the average daily undrawn stated amount under each letter of credit  payable quarterly in arrears and iii documentary and processing charges in accordance with the letter of credit issuer s standard schedule for such charges 
a ratings downgrade would result in an increase in the cost of borrowing and of maintaining letters of credit  but would not result in any default or acceleration of the debt under either the idacorp facility or the ipc facility 
the events of default under both the idacorp facility and the ipc facility include i nonpayment of principal when due and nonpayment of reimbursement obligations under letters of credit within one business day after becoming due and nonpayment of interest or other fees within five days after becoming due  ii materially false representations or warranties made on behalf of the applicable company or any of its subsidiaries on the date as of which made  iii breach of covenants  subject in some instances to grace periods  iv voluntary and involuntary bankruptcy of the applicable company or any material subsidiary  v the non consensual appointment of a receiver or similar official for the applicable company or any of its material subsidiaries or any substantial portion as defined in the applicable facility of its property  vi condemnation of all or any substantial portion of the property of the applicable company and its subsidiaries  vii default in the payment of indebtedness in excess of million or a default by the applicable company or any of its subsidiaries under any agreement under which such debt was created or governed which will cause or permit the acceleration of such debt or if any of such debt is declared to be due and payable prior to its stated maturity  viii the applicable company or any of its subsidiaries not paying  or admitting in writing its inability to pay  its debts as they become due  ix the applicable company or any of its subsidiaries failing to pay certain judgments  x the acquisition by any person or two or more persons acting in concert of beneficial ownership within the meaning of rule d of the securities exchange act of of percent or more of the outstanding shares of voting stock of the applicable company  xi the failure of idacorp to own free and clear of all liens  all of the outstanding shares of voting stock of ipc  xii unfunded liabilities of all single employer plans under the employee retirement income security act of exceeding million and xiii the applicable company or any subsidiary being subject to any proceeding or investigation pertaining to the release of any toxic or hazardous waste or substance into the environment or any violation of any environmental law as defined in the applicable facility which could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect as defined in the applicable facility 
a default or an acceleration of indebtedness of idacorp or ipc in excess of million  including indebtedness under the applicable facility will result in a cross default under the other facility 
upon any event of default relating to the voluntary or involuntary bankruptcy of idacorp or ipc or the appointment of a receiver  the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the facility and of the letter of credit issuer to issue letters of credit will automatically terminate and all unpaid obligations will become due and payable 
upon any other event of default  the lenders holding percent of the outstanding loans or percent of the aggregate commitments required lenders or the administrative agent with the consent of the required lenders may terminate or suspend the obligations of the lenders to make loans under the facility and of the letter of credit issuer to issue letters of credit under the facility or declare the obligations to be due and payable 
idacorp and ipc will also be required to deposit into a collateral account an amount equal to the aggregate undrawn stated amount under all outstanding letters of credit and the aggregate unpaid reimbursement obligations thereunder 
if there is a ratings downgrade below investment grade bbb or higher by s p and baa or higher by moody s  then ipc s authority for continuing borrowings under its regulatory approvals issued by the ipuc and the opuc must be extended or renewed during the occurrence of the ratings downgrade 
the oregon statutes  however  permit the issuance or renewal of indebtedness maturing not more than one year after the date of such issue or renewal without approval of the opuc 
in an order issued may   the ipuc clarified that ipc s authority will not terminate but will continue for a period of days from any downgrade below investment grade 
debt covenants the idacorp facility and the ipc facility each contain a covenant requiring the company to maintain a leverage ratio of consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capitalization of no more than percent as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
at december   the leverage ratio for both idacorp and ipc was percent 
at december   idacorp was in compliance with all other covenants of the idacorp facility and ipc was in compliance with all other covenants of the ipc facility 
both the idacorp facility and the ipc facility contain additional covenants including

credit ratings on january   standard poor s rating services lowered its corporate credit rating on idacorp and ipc to bbb from bbb 
the outlook for both companies changed to stable from negative 
s p stated that its decision reflected a gradual deterioration of cash flow coverage as well as a failure to sufficiently address long term ratemaking issues in the proposed idaho general rate case settlement 
specifically  s p indicated that the proposed settlement fails to resolve issues such as the use of a forecasted test year or the appropriate level of load growth adjustment credit 
access to capital markets at a reasonable cost is determined in large part by credit quality 
these downgrades are expected to increase the cost of new debt issuances and outstanding variable rate debt issuances within the downgraded ratings categories

pollution control revenue refunding bonds two series of bonds have been issued for the benefit of ipc and are each supported by a financial guaranty insurance policy issued by ambac assurance corporation ambac 
the two series are the million aggregate principal amount of pollution control revenue refunding bonds idaho power company project series issued by sweetwater county  wyoming due sweetwater bonds  and the million aggregate principal amount of pollution control revenue refunding bonds idaho power company project series issued by humboldt county  nevada due humboldt bonds 
the pollution control bonds currently bear interest at an auction interest rate reset every days for the humboldt bonds and every seven days for sweetwater bonds 

table of contents the humboldt bonds and sweetwater bonds are each rated aaa by s p and aaa by moody s  respectively 
fitch also rated each series of bonds 
on january   fitch announced that it had downgraded ambac s insurer financial strength rating to aa from aaa and was keeping the rating on negative watch 
fitch also downgraded the humboldt bonds and the sweetwater bonds to aa from aaa 
s p s and moody s ratings for the bonds remain unchanged 
however  moody s placed ambac s insurance financial strength rating on review for possible downgrade on january   and  as a result of this review  moody s rated securities that are guaranteed by ambac were also placed under review for possible downgrade  except those with higher public underlying ratings 
s p also placed ambac s financial strength  financial enhancement and issuer credit ratings on creditwatch with negative implications on january  on february   s p affirmed ambac s aaa financial strength and financial enhancement ratings  but retained the negative watch 
the downgrade of ambac and the pollution control bonds has resulted in higher interest rates on the pollution control bonds 
such downgrades could also result in a failed auction  where there are no purchasers for the bonds 
a failed auction would result in the existing holders having to hold the pollution control bonds at the maximum interest rate of percent for the sweetwater bonds and at a specified rate capped at percent for the humboldt bonds 
if a failed auction occurs  new auctions will continue to be every days for the humboldt bonds and every seven days for the sweetwater bonds 
on february   auctions were held for both series of pollution control bonds 
the sweetwater bonds had a successful auction establishing a new interest rate of percent 
the humboldt bonds experienced a failed auction which resulted in a new interest rate of percent currently based on libor multiplied by and the humboldt bonds continuing to be held by the current holders 
ipc may exercise certain options available with respect to these bonds to lessen interest rate costs and volatility going forward 
ipc may redeem the bonds at par plus accrued and unpaid interest or convert them from the auction rate mode to another interest rate mode 
capital requirements utility construction program ipc s construction program and related expenditures are subject to on going review and are revised to include changes in load growth  construction costs  location of generation sources  transmission capacity  adequacy of rate recovery and environmental concerns 
variations in the timing and amounts of capital expenditures will result from regulatory and environmental factors  load growth  other resource acquisition needs and the timing of relicensing expenditures 
ipc is experiencing a cycle of heavy infrastructure investment needed to address continued customer growth  peak demand growth  and aging plant and equipment 
ipc s aging hydroelectric and thermal facilities require continuing upgrades and component replacement 
in addition  costs related to relicensing hydroelectric facilities and complying with the new licenses are substantial 
continuing load growth also requires that ipc add to its transmission system and distribution facilities to provide new service and to maintain reliability

western energy proceedings at the ferc ie and ipc are involved in a number of ferc proceedings arising out of the western energy situation in california and claims that dysfunctions in the organized california markets contributed to or caused unjust and unreasonable prices in pacific northwest spot markets  and may have been the result of manipulations of gas or electric power markets 
the following proceedings are included 

table of contents california refund this proceeding originated with an effort by the state of california to obtain refunds for a portion of the spot market sales from sellers of electricity into california from october   through june  california is claiming that the sales prices were not just and reasonable and were not in compliance with the fpa 
the ferc issued an order on refund liability on march  on which multiple parties  including ie  sought rehearing 
on october   the ferc denied the requests for rehearing and required the california independent system operator cal iso to make a compliance filing regarding refund amounts within five months  which has been delayed on a number of occasions and has not yet been filed with the ferc 
on may   the ferc issued an order clarifying its earlier refund orders 
the ferc denied requests for rehearing on november  on december   ie and others petitioned the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit for review of the ferc s orders on california refunds 
as additional ferc orders have been issued  further petitions for review have been filed  including by ie  and have been consolidated with the appeals already pending before the ninth circuit 
on september   the ninth circuit convened the first of its case management proceedings  a procedure reserved to help organize complex cases  staying action on all of the consolidated cases 
on october   the ninth circuit severed several issues related to the ferc s refund jurisdiction  established a schedule for briefing and held oral argument on april and  on september   the ninth circuit issued a decision in one of the severed cases concluding that the ferc lacked refund authority over wholesale electrical energy sales made by governmental entities and non public utilities 
on august   the ninth circuit issued its decision on a second severed case ruling that all transactions that occurred within or as a result of the calpx and the cal iso were the proper subject of the refund proceeding  refused to expand the proceedings into the bilateral market  approved the refund effective date as october  but required ferc to reconsider based upon claims that some market participants had violated governing tariff obligations the california parties are seeking a refund effective date of may   and effectively expanded the scope of the refund proceeding to transactions within the calpx and cal iso markets outside the hour spot market and energy exchange transactions 
on august  the ferc issued an order establishing a framework for those sellers wanting to make a cost filing to demonstrate that the generally applicable ferc refund methodology interfered with the recovery of costs 
ie and ipc along with others made a cost filing on september  during the next two months  the california entities on the one hand and ie and ipc on the other submitted filings that argued the merits of the cost filings 
on march   the ferc rejected the ie ipc cost filing and on april   ie and ipc sought rehearing of the rejection 
that request remains pending before the ferc 
ie and ipc are unable to predict how or when the ferc might rule on the request for rehearing 
before the rejection of the cost filing  on february   ie and ipc jointly filed with the california parties pacific gas electric company  san diego gas electric company  southern california edison company  the california public utilities commission  the california electricity oversight board  the california department of water resources and the california attorney general an offer of settlement at the ferc settling matters encompassed by the california refund proceeding including ie s and ipc s cost filing and refund obligation 
a number of other parties  representing substantially less than the majority of potential refund claims  chose to opt out of the settlement 
on may   the ferc issued an order determining the method that should be used to allocate amounts approved in cost filings  approving the methodology that ie and ipc and others had advocated prior to the time ie and ipc entered into the february  settlement allocating cost offsets to buyers in proportion to the net refunds they are owed through the cal iso and calpx markets 
on june   the california parties requested rehearing  urging the ferc to allocate the cost offsets to all purchasers from the cal iso and calpx markets and not just to that limited subset of purchasers who are net refund recipients 
on july   the ferc tolled the time to act on the request for rehearing and has not issued orders on rehearing since that time 
idacorp and ipc are unable to predict how or when the ferc might rule on the request for rehearing 
the ferc approved the february  offer of settlement on may  under the terms of the settlement  ie and ipc assigned million of the rights to accounts receivable from the cal iso and calpx to the california parties to pay into an escrow account for refunds to settling parties 
amounts from that escrow not used for settling parties and million of the remaining ie and ipc receivables that are to be retained by the calpx are available to fund  at least partially  payment of the claims of any non settling parties if they prevail in the remaining litigation of this matter 
any excess funds remaining at the end of the case are to be returned to ipc and ie 
approximately million of the remaining ie and ipc receivables was paid to ie and ipc under the settlement 
on june   the port of seattle  washington filed a request for rehearing of the ferc order approving the settlement 
on july   ipc and ie and the california parties filed a response to port of seattle s request for rehearing 
on october   the ferc issued an order denying the port of seattle s request for rehearing 
on october   the port of seattle petitioned the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit for review of the ferc orders approving the settlement 
the ninth circuit consolidated that review petition with the large number of review petitions already consolidated before it 
on october   the ninth circuit severed the appeal of the ferc s orders approving the settlement with the california parties along with appeals of two other similar cases from the remainder of the consolidated cases 
the ninth circuit established a briefing schedule for the three cases which currently concludes in late june a date for argument has not yet been scheduled 
ipc and ie are unable to predict when or how the ninth circuit might rule on port of seattle s petition for review 

table of contents a provision of the calpx participation agreement referred to as the chargeback provision was triggered when a participant defaulted on a payment to the calpx requiring other market participants to pay their allocated share of the default amount to the calpx 
this provision was triggered initially by the southern california edison and pacific gas and electric company defaults 
the ferc ordered the calpx to hold the chargeback funds until the conclusion of the california refund proceeding 
based upon the settlement between the california parties and ie and ipc discussed above  the ferc directed the return of ie s chargeback amounts  totaling million 
on june   ie received approximately million from the calpx representing the return of million in chargeback funds plus interest 
on december   with respect to the calpx chargeback and the california refund proceedings discussed above  the calpx and the cal iso owed million and million  respectively  for energy sales made to them by ipc in november and december in the fourth quarter of  ie reduced by million to million its reserve against these receivables 
this reserve was calculated taking into account the uncertainty of collection  given the california energy situation 
following payment of the million to ie and ipc in june  ie further reduced the reserve by million to million 
this reserve was calculated taking into account several unresolved issues in the california refund proceeding 
based on the reserve recorded as of december   idacorp believes that the future collectability of these receivables or any potential refunds ordered by the ferc would not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
pacific northwest refund these proceedings involved arguments that the spot market in the pacific northwest was affected by the dysfunction in the california market  warranting refunds 
the ferc rejected this claim on june   and denied rehearing on november  and february  the ferc orders were appealed to the ninth circuit 
oral argument was held on january  on august   the court filed an opinion in the appeal  remanding to the ferc the orders that declined to require refunds 
the court s opinion instructed the ferc to consider whether evidence of market manipulation submitted by the petitioners for the period january  to june  would have altered the agency s conclusions about refunds and directed the ferc to include sales to the california department of water resources in the proceeding 
on september   the court extended until november  the time for filing petitions for rehearing to allow the parties time to assess settlement prospects and directed senior judge edward leavey of the ninth circuit to initiate mediation efforts 
the ninth circuit did not renew the extension of time and a number of parties have sought rehearing of the ninth circuit s decision 
ie and ipc are unable to predict when the ninth circuit will rule on the requests for rehearing or the outcome of these matters 
the settlement in the california refund proceeding resolves all claims the california parties have against ie and ipc in the pacific northwest proceeding 
market manipulation these proceedings include two ferc show cause orders which resulted from a ruling of the ninth circuit that the ferc permit the california parties in the california refund proceeding to submit materials to the ferc demonstrating market manipulation by various sellers of electricity into california 
on june   the ferc ordered a large number of parties including ipc to show cause why certain trading practices did not constitute gaming gaming or anomalous market behavior partnership in violation of the cal iso and calpx tariffs 
on october   ipc reached agreement with the ferc staff on the show cause orders 
the gaming settlement was approved by the ferc on march  the ferc approved the motion to dismiss the partnership proceeding on january  although the orders establishing the scope of the show cause proceedings are presently the subject of review petitions in the ninth circuit  the order dismissing ipc from the partnership proceedings was not the subject of rehearing requests 
originally  eight parties requested rehearing of the ferc s march  order approving the gaming settlement 
the settlement between the california parties and ie and ipc discussed above in the california refund proceeding approved by the ferc on may   results in the california parties and other settling parties withdrawing their requests for rehearing of the settlement with the ferc staff regarding allegations of gaming 
on october   the ferc issued an order denying rehearing of its earlier approval of the gaming allegations  thereby effectively terminating the ferc investigations as to ipc and ie regarding bidding behavior  physical withholding of power and gaming without finding of wrongdoing 
on october   the port of seattle appealed the ferc order to the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit 
that appeal was consolidated with the other cases currently before the ninth circuit respecting western energy matters 
ie and ipc are unable to predict when or how the ninth circuit will rule on the petitions for review 

table of contents in addition to the two show cause orders  on june   the ferc also issued an order instituting an investigation of anomalous bidding behavior and practices in the western wholesale markets for the time period may  through october  to review evidence of economic withholding of generation 
ipc  along with over other market participants  responded to the ferc data requests and the ferc terminated its investigations as to ipc on may  numerous parties have appealed the ferc s termination of this investigation as to ipc and over other market participants 
ie and ipc are unable to predict when the ninth circuit will rule on the requests for rehearing or the outcome of these matters 
sierra club lawsuit bridger in february  the sierra club and the wyoming outdoor council filed a complaint against pacificorp in federal district court in cheyenne  wyoming alleging violations of air quality opacity standards at the jim bridger coal fired plant plant in sweetwater county  wyoming 
opacity is an indication of the amount of light obscured in the flue gas of a power plant 
a formal answer to the complaint was filed by pacificorp on april   in which pacificorp denied almost all of the allegations and asserted a number of affirmative defenses 
ipc is not a party to this proceeding but has a one third ownership interest in the plant 
pacificorp owns a two thirds interest and is the operator of the plant 
the complaint alleges thousands of opacity permit limit violations by pacificorp and seeks a declaration that pacificorp has violated opacity limits  a permanent injunction ordering pacificorp to comply with such limits  civil penalties of up to  per day per violation  and reimbursement of the plaintiff s costs of litigation  including reasonable attorney fees 
the us district court has set this matter for trial commencing in april discovery in the matter was completed on october  also in october  the plaintiffs and defendant filed cross motions for summary judgment on the alleged opacity permit violations 
the court has not yet ruled on those motions 
ipc continues to monitor the status of this matter but is unable to predict its outcome or what effect this matter may have on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sierra club notice of intent to file suit boardman on january   the oregon chapter of the sierra club  the northwest environmental defense center  friends of the columbia gorge  columbia riverkeeper  and hells canyon preservation council collectively  sierra club provided a day notice to portland general electric company pge of intent to file suit 
sierra club alleges violations of opacity standards at the boardman coal fired power plant located in morrow county  oregon of which ipc owns ten percent 
pge owns percent and is the operator of the plant 
opacity is an indication of the amount of light obscured in the flue gas of a power plant 
sierra further alleges violations of the clean air act  related federal regulations and the oregon state implementation plan relating to pge s construction and operation of the plant 
sierra club has not yet commenced litigation 
sierra club alleges thousands of opacity permit limit violations by pge from and before  and claims that it will seek a declaration that pge has violated opacity limits  a permanent injunction ordering pge to comply with such limits  and civil penalties of up to  per day per violation 
ipc intends to monitor the status of this matter but is unable to predict its outcome or what effect this matter may have on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
other legal proceedings idacorp and ipc are involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings in addition to those discussed above and in note to idacorp s and ipc s consolidated financial statements 
resolution of any of these matters will take time  and the companies cannot predict the outcome of any of these proceedings 
the companies believe that their reserves are adequate for these matters 
environmental issues idaho water management issues from through  and throughout  below normal precipitation and stream flows have exacerbated a developing water shortage in idaho  manifested by a number of water issues including declining snake river base flows and declining levels in the eastern snake plain aquifer espa  a large underground aquifer that has been estimated to hold between maf of water 
these issues are of interest to ipc because of their potential impacts on generation at ipc s hydroelectric projects 

table of contents as a result of declines in river flows  in several surface water users filed delivery calls with the idaho department of water resources idwr  demanding that it manage ground water withdrawals pursuant to the prior appropriation doctrine of first in time is first in right and curtail junior ground water rights that are depleting the aquifer and affecting flows to senior surface water rights 
these delivery calls have resulted in several administrative actions before the idwr to enforce senior water rights as well as judicial actions before the state court challenging the constitutionality of state regulations used by the idwr to conjunctively administer ground and surface water rights 
because ipc holds water rights that are dependent on the snake river  spring flows and the overall condition of the espa  ipc continues to participate in these actions  as necessary  to protect its water rights 
ipc  together with other interested water users and state interests  also continues to explore and encourage the development of a long term management plan that will protect the espa and the snake river from further depletion 
on february   the idaho water resource board iwrb presented the framework for an espa management plan to the idaho legislature recommending the development of a comprehensive aquifer management plan camp 
the proposed goal of the camp is to sustain the economic viability and social and environmental health of the espa by adaptively managing a balance between water use and supplies 
the iwrb estimates that the development of the camp will take months 
through house concurrent resolution and house bill  the idaho legislature appropriated funds and directed the iwrb to proceed with the development of the camp 
pursuant to the iwrb recommendation in the camp framework  an advisory committee has been established to make recommendations to the iwrb on the development of the camp 
ipc sits on the camp advisory committee and will be working with the iwrb on the development of the camp 
ipc is also engaged in the snake river basin adjudication srba  a general stream adjudication  commenced in  to define the nature and extent of water rights in the snake river basin in idaho  including the water rights of ipc 
the initiation of the srba resulted from the swan falls agreement  an agreement entered into by ipc and the governor and attorney general of idaho in october to resolve litigation relating to ipc s water rights at its swan falls project 
ipc has filed claims to its water rights for hydropower and other uses in the srba 
other water users in the basin have also filed claims to water rights 
parties to the srba may file objections to water right claims that adversely affect or injure their claimed water rights and the court then adjudicates the claims and objections and enters a decree defining a party s water right 
ipc has filed claims for all of its hydropower water rights in the srba  is actively protecting those water rights  and is objecting to claims that may potentially injure or affect those water rights 
one such claim involves a notice of claim of ownership filed on december   by the state of idaho  for a portion of the water rights held by ipc that are subject to the swan falls agreement 
on may   in order to protect its claims and the availability of water for power purposes at its facilities  and in response to the claim of ownership filed by the state  ipc filed a complaint and petition for declaratory and injunctive relief regarding the status and nature of ipc s water rights and the respective rights and responsibilities of the parties under the swan falls agreement 
the complaint was filed in the idaho district court for the fifth judicial district  the court with jurisdiction over the srba  against the state of idaho  the governor  the attorney general  the idwr and the director of the idwr 
in conjunction with the filing of the complaint and petition  ipc filed motions with the court to stay all pending proceedings involving the water rights of ipc and to consolidate those proceedings into a single action where all issues relating to the swan falls agreement can be determined 
ipc alleged in the complaint  among other things  that contrary to the parties belief at the time the swan falls agreement was entered into in  the snake river basin above swan falls was over appropriated and as a consequence there was not in  and there currently is not  water available for new upstream uses over and above the minimum flows established by the swan falls agreement  that because of this mutual mistake of fact relating to the over appropriation of the basin  the swan falls agreement should be reformed  that the state s december   claim of ownership to ipc s water rights should be denied  and that the swan falls agreement did not subordinate ipc s water rights to aquifer recharge 
on may   the state filed motions to dismiss ipc s complaint and petition 
these motions were briefed and  together with ipc s motions to stay and consolidate the proceedings  were argued before the court on june  
table of contents on july   the court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the state s motion to dismiss  consolidating the issues into a consolidated subcase before the court  providing for discovery during the objection period and setting a scheduling conference for december  in its order  the court denied the majority of the state s motion to dismiss  refusing to dismiss the complaint and finding that the court has jurisdiction to hear and determine virtually all the issues raised by ipc s complaint that relate to ipc s water rights and the effect of the swan falls agreement upon those water rights 
this includes the issues of ownership  whether ipc s water rights are subordinated to recharge and how those water rights are to be administered relative to other water rights on the same or connected resources 
the court did find that by virtue of a state statute the idwr  and its director  could not be parties to the srba and therefore stayed ipc s claims against the idwr and its director pending resolution of the issues to be litigated in the srba  or until further order of the court 
consistent with ipc s motion to consolidate and stay proceedings  the court consolidated all of the issues associated with ipc s water rights before the court and stayed that proceeding to allow other parties that may be affected by the litigation to file responses or intervene in the consolidated proceedings by december  on december   the court held a status and scheduling conference in the consolidated proceedings 
subsequently  the court issued a scheduling order on december   with a trial scheduled to begin on february  ipc is unable to predict the outcome of the consolidated proceedings 
ipc has also recently filed two actions in federal court against the united states bureau of reclamation to enforce a contract right for delivery of water to its hydropower projects on the snake river 
in  ipc and the united states entered into a contract that facilitated the development of the american falls reservoir by the us on the snake river in southeast idaho 
this contract entitles ipc to  acre feet of primary storage capacity in the reservoir and  acre feet of secondary storage that was to be available to ipc between october of any year and june of the following year as necessary to maintain specified flows at ipc s twin falls power plant below milner dam 
ipc believes that the us has failed to deliver this secondary storage  at the specified flows  since as a result  on october   ipc filed an action in the us district court of federal claims in washington  dc to recover damages from the us for the lost generation resulting from the reduced flows 
on october   ipc filed a second action in the united states district court for the district of idaho in boise  idaho  to compel the us to manage american falls reservoir and the snake river federal reservoir system to ensure that ipc s contract right to secondary storage is fulfilled in the future 
the us bureau of reclamation filed an answer in the case filed with the us district court for the district of idaho on february  no answer has been filed in the case filed in the us court of claims 
ipc is unable to predict the outcome of this litigation 
air quality issues ipc owns two natural gas combustion turbine power plants and co owns three coal fired power plants that are subject to air quality regulation 
the natural gas fired plants  danskin and bennett mountain  are located in idaho 
the coal fired plants are jim bridger percent interest located in wyoming  boardman ten percent interest located in oregon  and north valmy percent interest located in nevada 
the clean air act establishes controls on the emissions from stationary sources like those owned by ipc 
the environmental protection agency epa adopts many of the standards and regulations under the clean air act  while states have the primary responsibility for implementation and administration of these air quality programs 
ipc continues to actively monitor  evaluate and work on air quality issues pertaining to the clean air mercury rule camr  possible legislative amendment of the clean air act  emerging greenhouse gas programs at the federal  regional and state levels  new source review permitting  national ambient air quality standards naaqs  and regional haze best available retrofit technology rh bart 
low nitrogen oxide nox burner technology and mercury continuous emission monitoring systems mercury cems installations are progressing at all three coal fired power plants 
national ambient air quality standards epa adopted naaqs for fine particulate matter became effective in december this new standard has been challenged by a number of groups in the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
all of the counties in idaho  nevada  oregon  and wyoming where ipc s power plants operate are currently designated as meeting attainment with federal air quality standards  including the new particulate matter standard 
nevertheless  under the new fine particulate standards  three years of data are being collected to determine the attainment status of all us counties 
in july  the epa proposed to revise the naaqs for hour ozone 
for the primary health based standard  epa is proposing that the standard be lowered from parts per million ppm to between and ppm 
the epa received public comment for days and held public hearings 
the impact of these new standards will not be known until these data are collected  analyzed  and released to the public and the associated regulatory programs are promulgated and implemented 
clean air mercury rule the camr  issued by the epa on march   limits mercury emissions from new and existing coal fired power plants and creates a market based cap and trade program that will permanently cap utility mercury emissions 
on february   the us court of appeals for the dc circuit vacated the camr and remanded it back to the epa for reconsideration consistent with the court s interpretation of the clean air act 
the epa could appeal this decision but  in the absence of an appeal  the impact of this decision will not be known until such time as the epa develops a new report in response to the court s decision 

table of contents in response to the camr  the idaho department of environmental quality ideq proposed two new rules to the idaho environmental quality commission a rule to opt out of the federal mercury cap and trade program  and a rule to prohibit the construction and operation of a coal fired power plant in idaho 
in april  the governor of idaho signed house bill  which placed a two year moratorium on applying for or issuance of permits  licenses or construction of certain coal fired power plants in idaho 
the moratorium expires on april  during the idaho state legislative session  the state did not reject the proposal to opt out of the cap and trade program  therefore accepting the opt out rule 
in january  senate bill was introduced which  if enacted  would extend the current moratorium for an additional two years 
ipc has no current plans impacted by the moratorium or opting out of the camr cap and trade program 
on october   the wyoming environmental quality council weqc approved the wyoming department of environmental quality s wdeq recommended wyoming regulation to implement camr 
this rule will allocate mercury allowances to each plant based on heat input and hold back ten percent of the allocated allowances for new sources 
this rule will also allow plants to participate in the national cap and trade program 
mercury cems are planned to be installed at the jim bridger plant in at an estimated cost of million ipc share 
until the mercury cems are installed and operational  the amount of mercury emissions is not definitively known 
it is not possible at this time to determine the effect of the allowance allocation rule on future operations and costs at the plant 
on december   the oregon environmental quality commission adopted the oregon department of environmental quality odeq proposed utility mercury rule 
ipc estimates that capital expenditures for mercury controls at boardman will be million ipc share with an annual incremental operations and maintenance cost of up to million ipc share 
the mercury rule will provide a limited number of mercury allowances to boardman that may be used for trading 
the nevada department of environmental protection has adopted a state camr that will provide mercury allowances to each plant based on actual emissions until  at which time the allowance allocations will be reduced to meet the federal cap 
to meet the reduced allocations in the year  mercury controls are expected to be installed 
mercury cems are planned to be installed at the north valmy plant in at an estimated cost of million ipc share 
at this time  it is uncertain how state mercury rules or requirements might be impacted by the vacated camr and any resulting impacts to ipc 
regional haze best available retrofit technology in accordance with federal regional haze rules  the wdeq and odeq are conducting an assessment of emission sources pursuant to a rh bart process 
coal fired utility boilers are subject to rh bart if they were built between and and affect any class i areas 
this includes all four units at the jim bridger and boardman plants 
the two units at the north valmy plant were constructed after and are not subject to the federal regional haze rule 
pacificorp submitted the rh bart application for the jim bridger plant in january the wdeq is still evaluating the application and will go out for public comment 
if there are no appeals to the application  the wdeq will prepare a state implementation plan to present to the weqc for approval and submittal to the epa 
the plant is already in the process of installing low nox burners and scrubber upgrades that are proposed in the application 
over the next four years  these upgrade expenditures are currently estimated at million ipc share  with a total upgrade expenditures estimated at million ipc share 
pge completed the rh bart analysis for the boardman plant and submitted it to the odeq on november  this analysis includes proposed emission control upgrades for the boardman plant to comply with rh bart requirements 
capital upgrade costs required to meet rh bart standards could vary significantly depending on the technology utilized 
because of the combined benefit of emission equipment that reduces multiple pollutants simultaneously  upgrade plans under consideration will also meet camr standards 
upgrade cost estimates to meet both standards range from million to million ipc share 
depending on what pollution control equipment is required to meet the standards  an extended maintenance outage may be necessary 
no commitments are in place at this time and the cost estimates are preliminary and subject to change 
more detailed information will be available after completion of the analysis for the boardman plant and approval of the rh bart proposals by state and federal environmental regulators 

table of contents greenhouse gases ipc continues to monitor and evaluate the possible adoption of national  regional  or state greenhouse gas ghg regulations and judicial decisions that would affect electric utilities 
at the national level  numerous ghg bills have been introduced in the us senate and house of representatives during and debate continues in congress on the direction and scope of us policy on regulation of ghgs 
ipc anticipates new developments to occur in the states of arizona  california  new mexico  oregon  utah and washington  along with the provinces of british columbia and manitoba  canada  have formed the western regional climate action initiative wci 
on august   the wci partners released their regional goal to collectively reduce ghgs percent below levels by the wci partners have agreed to design a regional market based multi sector mechanism  such as a load based or deliverer based cap and trade program  to help achieve the goal 
the states of idaho  nevada and wyoming have not joined the wci 
it is possible that these and other states in which ipc operates or sells electricity into could join the wci in the future 
california s governor signed an executive order in to reduce ghgs in that state to designated historical levels 
on september   california s governor signed into law the global warming solutions act of  which established ghg reduction goals and a framework for achieving these goals 
on january   california enacted a ghg emission performance standard applicable to all electricity generated within the state or delivered from outside the state 
oregon passed the global warming integration act in june  which  among other things  established the oregon global warming commission and state wide ghg emission reduction goals 
ipc will continue to monitor developments with respect to the implementation of this legislation  however  until the oregon global warming commission makes its recommendations and the associated regulatory programs are promulgated and implemented  it is not possible to determine the effect of this legislation on ipc s operations  particularly the boardman facility 
the washington legislature passed a bill in april that sets climate pollution reduction and clean energy goals 
emission performance standards affecting electric utility contracts and power plant projects are included 
other regional and state ghg initiatives appear likely  although the states of idaho  nevada and wyoming have not adopted ghg legislation 
national  regional or state ghg requirements  if enacted and applicable  could result in significant costs to ipc to comply with restrictions on carbon dioxide or other ghg emissions 
information about idacorp s carbon dioxide emissions is included in the report benchmarking air emissions of the largest electric power producers in the united states this report was released by the ceres investor coalition  the natural resources defense council and the public service enterprise group inc in april the report lists idacorp s carbon dioxide emissions at  lbs mwh  as compared to the reported average for the largest power producers of  lbs mwh 
ipc s carbon dioxide emissions on a lbs mwh basis fluctuate with the amount of hydroelectric generation 
even during a low water year like  ipc s emissions from electricity generation were below the average of the largest power producers 
during  ipc s carbon dioxide emissions were approximately  lbs mwh 
as part of ipc s resource planning protocol  the irp process considers potential ghg emissions regulation and other environmental factors when evaluating potential portfolios 
the irp included a risk analysis of the costs associated with the regulation of carbon dioxide emissions by analyzing low  expected and high cases of  and respectively  per ton of carbon dioxide emitted 
environmental impacts have been and will continue to be integral components of ipc s resource decisions 
due to escalating construction costs  potential permitting issues  and continued uncertainty surrounding future ghg laws and regulations  ipc has determined that coal fired generation is not the best technology to meet its resource needs in ipc has shifted its focus to the development of a combined cycle natural gas fired resource located closer to its load center in southern idaho 
also  ipc added mw of contracted wind generation in december bringing ipc s total to mw 
another mw of contracted wind generation is under construction 
ipc is in the process of adding mw of geothermal generation by additional wind and geothermal generation is anticipated through cspp and rfp driven contracts 

table of contents in april  the us supreme court issued its decision in massachusetts v 
environmental protection agency  a case involving the epa s authority to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from motor vehicles under the clean air act 
the court held that  with respect to mobile sources  the epa has authority under the clean air act to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant and that the epa has a duty to determine whether carbon dioxide emissions contribute to climate change or provide some reasonable explanation why it will not exercise its authority 
the decision  combined with stimulus from state  regional and federal legislative and regulatory initiatives  judicial decisions and other factors may lead to a determination by the epa to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from stationary sources  including electricity generators 
ipc will continue to monitor developments with respect to the possible regulation of ghg emissions from stationary sources under the clean air act 
new source review epa region began reviewing pacificorp operations  including the jim bridger plant of which ipc is a one third owner for compliance with new source review nsr and new source performance standards nsps through a clean air act section information request sent in may pacificorp completed its phased response to the section request in february with the submission of a large volume of documents to epa relating to historical activities at bridger and other pacificorp power plants 
a number of utilities that have also been the subject of epa nsr information requests have engaged in settlement negotiations with the epa to resolve allegations of nsr and nsps noncompliance 
prior settlements reached between the epa and utility companies around the country to resolve these issues have resulted in commitments by the utility companies to install additional pollution control equipment and to pay civil penalties 
ipc cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
endangered species in december  the us fish and wildlife service usfws listed several species of fish and five species of snails living within ipc s operating area as threatened or endangered species under the endangered species act 
ipc continues to review and analyze the effect such designation has on its operations and is cooperating with governmental agencies to resolve issues related to these species 
on september   the species of snail that had been listed as the idaho springsnail was delisted by the usfws 
the delisting decision was based on recent studies that indicated the species was synonymous with another common species 
on december   ipc and the governor of idaho submitted a petition to the usfws to de list the threatened bliss rapids snail 
the petition was supported with data collected by ipc over the past years 
the snail  which lives throughout the middle snake river  springs  and tributaries between niagara springs and king hill  was listed as threatened under the endangered species act in as of december   no decision on the delisting petition had been issued by the usfws 
pursuant to ferc license  ipc owns and finances the operation of anadromous fish hatcheries and related facilities to mitigate the effects of its hydroelectric dams on fish populations 
in connection with its fish facilities  ipc sponsors ongoing programs for the control of fish disease  improvement of fish production  and evaluation of hatchery performance 
ipc s anadromous fish facilities at hells canyon  oxbow  rapid river  pahsimeroi and niagara springs continue to be operated by the idaho department of fish and game 
at december   the investment in these facilities was million and the annual cost of operation was million 
climate change ipc s substantial hydroelectric generation resources neither burn nor consume fossil fuels to produce electric energy to meet the needs of its customers 
given the debate concerning climate change  consensus is growing that broad steps should be taken in all sectors of the nation s economy to carefully consider ways of limiting and or reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating climate change impacts while still providing necessary services in a cost effective manner 
ipc intends to continue to add renewable resources to its resource portfolio and will continue to monitor the climate change debate  current climate change research  and recently enacted as well as proposed legislation to identify the potential impacts of global climate change on all aspects of its business 
long term climate change could significantly affect ipc s business in a variety of ways  including but not limited to  the following a changes in temperature  precipitation and snow pack conditions could affect customer demand and the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation  and b legislative and or regulatory developments related to climate change could affect plans and operations in various ways including placing restrictions on the construction of new generation resources  the expansion of existing resources  or the operation of generation resources in general 
ipc cannot  however  quantify the potential impact of global climate change on its business at this time 
renewable portfolio standards legislation to adopt a national renewable portfolio standard rps has been introduced into but not yet adopted by congress 
ipc expects debate to continue on a national rps and anticipates new developments in 
table of contents a number of states in which ipc operates or sells power into have enacted rps legislation 
for example  oregon law requires the state s largest utilities to meet percent of their electric load with renewable energy by because of its relatively small presence in the state  ipc is not currently subject to the oregon rps 
it is possible that idaho and other states in which ipc operates or sells power into could adopt similar rps initiatives 
ipc will continue to monitor rps developments but cannot  at this time  predict the impacts of state and federal rps legislation on its business 
regulatory matters general rate case idaho on june   ipc filed an application with the ipuc requesting an average rate increase of approximately percent for its idaho customers in order to begin recovery of its capital investments and higher operating costs 
ipc s proposal would increase its revenues million annually 
the application included a requested return on equity of percent and an overall rate of return of percent 
ipc filed its case based upon a forecast test year  a first for ipc in the idaho jurisdiction 
since ipc s last general rate case filing in  ipc projected that it will have placed in service an additional million of investment in its electrical system during and ipc also requested a per mwh lgar  which adjusts the power supply costs ipc includes in the pca for differences between actual load and the load used in calculating base rates 
the existing lgar is per mwh 
the impact of the new lgar on ipc will ultimately be determined by future load changes 
ipuc staff and intervenor testimony was filed december  the parties to the proceeding reached a settlement that includes an average annual increase of percent approximately million annually 
neither an overall rate of return nor a return on equity is specified in the settlement 
the currently authorized rate of return would remain at percent 
the parties to the proceeding also agreed in the settlement to make a good faith effort to develop a mechanism to adjust or replace the current lgar 
as an interim solution  the parties have agreed to use the lgar of per mwh recommended by the ipuc staff on december   but to apply it to only percent of the load growth occurring during each month within the april march pca year 
the parties also agreed to participate in a good faith discussion regarding a forecast test year methodology that balances the auditing concerns of the ipuc staff and intervenors with ipc s need for timely rate relief 
the parties agreed that such a methodology would begin with auditable numbers from which projections would be made for the test year 
ipc filed a settlement stipulation with the ipuc on january  the settlement is subject to approval by the ipuc 
the parties have requested in the settlement stipulation that the new rates become effective no later than march   but ipc is unable to predict what relief the ipuc will grant or when the ipuc will issue its final order 
deferred accrued net power supply costs ipc s deferred accrued net power supply costs consisted of the following at december in thousands of dollars idaho pca current year accrual for the rate year deferral for the rate year idaho pca true up awaiting recovery refund authorized may authorized may oregon deferral costs costs costs total deferral accrual the pca reflected million of emission allowance sales to be credited to customers 
the pca deferral balance reflects million of emission allowance sales in 
table of contents idaho ipc has a pca mechanism that provides for annual adjustments to the rates charged to its idaho retail customers 
these adjustments are based on forecasts of net power supply costs  which are fuel and purchased power less off system sales  and the true up of the prior year s forecast 
during the year  percent of the difference between the actual and forecasted costs is deferred with interest 
the ending balance of this deferral  called the true up for the current year s portion and the true up of the true up for the prior years unrecovered portion  is then included in the calculation of the next year s pca 
the true up of the true up portion of the pca provides a tracking of the collection or the refund of true up amounts 
each month  the collection or the refund of the true up amount is quantified based upon the true up portion of the pca rate and the consumption of energy by customers 
at the end of the pca year  the total collection or refund is compared to the previously determined amount to be collected or refunded 
any difference between authorized amounts and amounts actually collected or refunded are then reflected in the following pca year  which becomes the true up of the true up 
over time  the actual collection or refund of authorized true up dollars matches the amounts authorized 
on may   the ipuc approved ipc s pca filing 
the filing increased the pca component of customers rates from the then existing level  which was million below base rates  to a level that is million above those base rates 
this million increase is net of million of proceeds from sales of excess so emission allowances 
the new rates became effective june  on june   ipc implemented the pca  which reduced the pca component of customers rates from the then existing level  which was recovering million above then existing base rates  to a level that was million below those base rates  a decrease of approximately million 
idaho load growth adjustment rate lgar on january   the ipuc issued an order resetting ipc s lgar to per mwh  effective april  the lgar subtracts the cost of serving additional idaho retail load from the net power supply costs ipc is allowed to include in its pca 
the order revised the lgar from the original rate of per mwh set when the pca began in this amount was established as the projected additional variable energy costs attributable to load growth and was subtracted from each year s pca expense 
in its petition  ipc had requested the use of the embedded cost of serving new load and a rate of per mwh  but the ipuc in its order determined to use the projected marginal cost  which resulted in the higher lgar 
as discussed above in general rate case idaho  a settlement stipulation before the ipuc in that rate case would reset the lgar to per mwh  but would apply that rate to only percent of the load growth occurring each month within the april march pca year 
in the current general rate  ipc filed normalized firm base load of million mwh as compared with million mwh in the general rate case 
because the lgar is reset in general rate cases  ipc expects to update its filed base load on a more frequent basis during periods of high load growth 
emission allowances during  ipc sold  so emission allowances for a total of million  after subtracting transaction fees 
the sales proceeds to be allocated to the idaho jurisdiction are approximately million million net of tax  assuming a tax rate of approximately percent 
on january   a workshop was held to discuss whether the customer share of the idaho jurisdictional portion of the sales proceeds should once again be included as a pca credit or used to reduce investment costs in wind development  green tags  or other options that would provide longer term customer benefits 
because the workshop participants were unable to reach a consensus regarding the use of the so emission allowance proceeds  the ipuc determined that the case would proceed under modified procedure 
written comments were due february  in and early  ipc sold  so emission allowances for a total of million  after subtracting transaction fees 
the sales proceeds allocated to the idaho jurisdiction were approximately million million net of tax  assuming a tax rate of approximately percent 
on may   the ipuc approved a stipulation that allowed ipc to retain ten percent as a shareholder benefit with the remaining percent plus a carrying charge recorded as a customer benefit 
this customer benefit is included in ipc s pca calculations as a credit to the pca true up balance and is currently reflected in pca rates during the june   through may   pca rate year 

table of contents the bulk of ipc s accumulated excess emission allowances were sold during the period 
ipc has approximately  excess emission allowances currently and anticipates realizing a similar amount annually into the near future 
tighter emission restrictions are expected in the long term which may cause ipc to use more emission allowances for its own requirements and reduce the annual amount of excess emission allowances 
oregon on april   ipc filed for an accounting order with the opuc to defer net power supply costs for the period from may   through april   in anticipation of higher than normal power supply expenses 
in the oregon general rate case  normal power supply expenses were set at a negative number meaning that under normal water conditions ipc should be able to sell enough surplus energy to pay for all fuel and purchased power expenses and still have revenue left over to offset other costs 
ipc requested authorization to defer an estimated million  which is oregon s jurisdictional share of the excess power supply costs 
ipc also requested that it earn its oregon authorized rate of return on the deferred balance and recover the amount through rates in future years  as approved by the opuc 
ipc is awaiting an order from the opuc 
on april   ipc filed for an accounting order with the opuc to defer net power supply costs for the period of may   through april  ipc requested authorization to defer an estimated million  which is oregon s jurisdictional share of the excess power supply costs 
ipc also requested that it earn its oregon authorized rate of return on the deferred balance and recover the amount through rates in future years  as approved by the opuc 
on april   a tentative settlement agreement was reached on the deferral application with the opuc staff and the citizens utility board in the amount of million 
the parties also agreed that ipc would file an application for an oregon pca mechanism 
the settlement stipulation was approved by the opuc on december  the timing of future recovery of oregon power supply cost deferrals is subject to an oregon statute that specifically limits rate amortizations of deferred costs to six percent per year 
ipc is currently recovering through rates power supply costs associated with the western energy situation of full recovery of the deferral is not expected until the and the deferrals will be amortized sequentially following the full recovery of the deferral 
oregon power cost adjustment mechanism pcam on august   ipc filed an application with the opuc requesting the approval of a power cost adjustment mechanism similar to the idaho pca 
if the application is approved  it will allow ipc to recover excess net power supply costs or distribute benefits to customers in a more timely fashion than through the existing deferral process 
the proposed mechanism differs from the idaho pca in that is reestablishes the base net power supply costs annually 
in idaho  the base net power supply costs are set by a general rate case 
settlement conferences were held and the interested parties reached a verbal agreement 
a stipulation has been drafted by ipc and is being reviewed by the parties to the settlement 
in connection with this proceeding  on october   ipc made a filing with the opuc requesting that revenues associated with ipc s base net power supply costs be increased by million for oregon 
in isolation  this would be an average percent increase in rates  however  a yet to be filed forecast of net power supply costs would also be a component of future pcam rates 
if the opuc approves the pcam  any changes in rates are not expected to be effective until june fixed cost adjustment mechanism fca on january   ipc filed with the ipuc for authority to implement a rate adjustment mechanism that would adjust rates downward or upward to recover fixed costs independent of the volume of ipc s energy sales 
this filing was a continuation of a case that was opened to investigate the financial disincentives to investment in energy efficiency by ipc 
this true up mechanism would be applicable only to residential and small general service customers 
the accounting for the fca will be separate from the pca 
ipc proposed a three percent cap on any rate increase to be applied at the discretion of the ipuc 

table of contents ipc and the ipuc staff agreed in concept to a three year pilot program beginning january   and a stipulation was filed on december  the stipulation called for the implementation of a fca mechanism pilot program as proposed by ipc in its original application with additional conditions and provisions related to customer count and weather normalization methodology  recording of the fca deferral amount in reports to the ipuc and detailed reporting of dsm activities 
the ipuc approved the stipulation on march  the pilot program began retroactively on january   and will run through  with the first rate adjustment to occur on june   and subsequent rate adjustments to occur on june of each year thereafter during the term of the pilot program 
ipc accrued million of fca expense in pension expense in the idaho general rate case  the ipuc disallowed recovery of pension expense because there were no current contributions being made to the plan 
on march   ipc filed a request with the ipuc to clarify that ipc can consider future contributions made to the pension plan a recoverable cost of service 
on june   the ipuc issued its order authorizing ipc to account for its defined benefit pension expense on a cash basis  and to defer and account for accrued pension expense under sfas  employers accounting for pensions  as a regulatory asset 
the ipuc acknowledged that it is appropriate for ipc to seek recovery in its revenue requirement of reasonable and prudently incurred pension expense based on actual cash contributions 
the order did not determine the method of recovery 
ipc began deferring pension expense to a regulatory asset account to be matched with revenue when future pension contributions are recovered through rates 
the deferral of pension expense did not begin until million of past contributions still recorded on the balance sheet at december   were expensed 
for  approximately million was deferred to a regulatory asset beginning in the third quarter 
ipc did not request a carrying charge to be applied to the deferral of the accrued sfas expense 
ami report ipc filed its advanced metering infrastructure ami status report with the ipuc on may   in compliance with an ipuc order 
the report details ipc s resolution of the ami related issues identified in the december ami status report 
on august   ipc filed a supplemental report detailing its assessment of how it will proceed with ami deployment 
in the report ipc provided a summary of the financial analysis  a three year ami implementation plan beginning in late  a discussion of cost recovery and identification of remaining issues 
federal regulatory matters the bonneville power administration residential exchange program the pacific northwest electric power planning and conservation act of  through the residential exchange program  provides access to the benefits of low cost federal hydroelectric power to residential and small farm customers of the region s investor owned utilities ious 
the program is administered by the bonneville power administration bpa 
ipc entered into settlement agreements with the bpa that settled ipc s rights under the residential exchange program rep for the fiscal year rate period and for the fiscal year rate period 
pursuant to these agreements between the bpa and ipc  benefits from the bpa were passed through to ipc s idaho and oregon residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits 
on may   the us court of appeals for the ninth circuit ruled that the settlement agreements entered into between the bpa and the ious including ipc are inconsistent with the northwest power act 
on may   the bpa notified ipc and six other ious that it was immediately suspending the rep payments that the utilities pass through to their residential and small farm customers in the form of electricity bill credits 
ipc took action with both the ipuc and the opuc to reduce the level of credit on its customers bill to zero  effective june  from october  to june   ipc had passed through to its rep customers approximately million in benefits pursuant to the settlement agreements 
since that time ipc has been working with the other northwest ious  northwest state public utility commissions  and the bpa to craft an agreement so that residential and small farm customers of ipc can resume sharing in the benefits of the federal columbia river power system 
however  the matter has yet to be resolved 
the bpa has initiated several public processes  which ultimately will determine whether benefits will be restored to ipc customers 
the most significant of these processes is the wp supplemental rate case 
ipc will fully participate in this proceeding  which is expected to be completed prior to october  at issue is the rep calculation and allocation of benefits to ious  and ipc specifically  and resolution of claims of overpayment in past periods 
since these rep benefits were passed through to ipc s customers  the outcome of this matter is not expected to have a significant effect on ipc s financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents ferc investigation on march   the ferc advised ipc that the ferc was commencing a preliminary  non public investigation into the pricing and availability of transmission capacity into and out of ipc s ipco point of delivery and transactions related to that transmission capacity during the period january   to present 
subsequently  the ferc made two data requests in connection with this investigation 
ipc responded to those data requests between june and august at ipc s request  ipc representatives met with ferc personnel on october   to discuss several data responses that ipc had previously provided 
in follow up to that meeting  ipc had further discussions with and submitted additional materials to the ferc staff 
ipc is unable to predict the outcome of this investigation 
ferc proceedings open access transmission tariff oatt on march   ipc submitted a revised oatt filing with the ferc requesting an increase in transmission rates 
in the filing ipc proposed to move from a fixed rate to a formula rate  which allows for transmission rates to be updated each year based on ferc form data 
the formula rate request included a rate of return on equity of percent 
the proposed rates would have produced an annual revenue increase for the ferc jurisdiction of approximately million based on test year data 
the ferc accepted ipc s rates  effective june   subject to adjustment to conform to sfas tax accounting requirements  which lowered the estimated annual increase in revenues to approximately million 
on august   the ferc approved a settlement agreement filed in june by the parties on all issues except the treatment of contracts for transmission service that contain their own terms  conditions and rates and that were in existence before the implementation of oatt in legacy agreements 
the effect of this settlement was to reduce the estimated ferc jurisdictional annual revenue increase from million to approximately million based on test year data 
the settlement agreement required that amounts collected in excess of the new rates for the june   through july   period be refunded with interest to customers 
these refunds totaled approximately million and were paid in august hearings were held before the ferc in june regarding the treatment of the legacy agreements 
ipc s position was that the revenue ipc receives under the legacy agreements should be credited against the total transmission revenue requirement attributed to oatt customers and that the contract demands of the legacy agreements should not be included in the load divisor of the rate formula 
the intervenors in the proceeding took the position that such contract demands should be included in the load divisor  rather than being revenue credited 
on august   the ferc presiding administrative law judge alj issued an initial decision initial decision with respect to the treatment of the legacy agreements  which is on file and publicly available at ferc docket no 
er in the initial decision  the alj concluded that i the legacy agreements should be included in the load divisor of the rate formula and ii the revenue ipc receives under the legacy agreements should not be credited against the total transmission revenue requirement attributed to oatt customers 
if the initial decision is implemented  ipc estimates that this ruling will reduce the estimated ferc jurisdictional annual revenue increase based on test year data to million 
ipc has appealed the initial decision to the ferc 
however  if the initial decision is implemented  ipc would make additional refunds  including interest  of approximately million for the june   through december   period 
ipc has reserved this entire amount 
ipc expects to pursue recovery of amounts not received pursuant to a final order in this proceeding through additional proceedings at the ferc or through the state ratemaking process 
ipc is awaiting a final ferc order 

table of contents ferc order in february  the ferc issued order no 
adopting a final rule designed to strengthen the pro forma oatt by providing greater consistency and increasing transparency 
the ferc had stated in its notice of proposed rulemaking leading to the final rule that as a general matter  the purpose of this rulemaking is to strengthen the pro forma oatt to ensure that it achieves its original purpose remedying undue discrimination not to create new market structures 
the most significant revisions to the pro forma oatt relate to the development of more consistent methodologies for calculating available transfer capability  changes to the transmission planning process  changes to the pricing of certain generator and energy imbalances to encourage efficient scheduling behavior and to exempt intermittent generators  and changes regarding long term point to point transmission service  including the addition of conditional firm long term point to point transmission service  and generation re dispatch 
as a transmission provider with an oatt on file with the ferc  ipc is required to comply with the requirements of the new rule 
a major requirement of the new rule was to file a revised pro forma oatt on july  ipc also was required to file a revised attachment c specifying the methodology to assess available transfer capability on september   and an attachment k which sets forth its coordinated  open and transparent planning process on december  ipc made the required ferc filings and is currently operating under the new tariff 
on december   the ferc issued order no 
a  an order on rehearing and clarification of order order no 
a primarily affirms and clarifies order no 
order no 
a will become effective days after its publication in the federal register 
certain details related to the rule remain to be determined prospectively  and thus it is difficult to make a precise determination of the overall effect of this new rule on ipc s transmission operations or wholesale marketing function 
however  at least on a preliminary basis  the rule is not anticipated to have a significant impact on ipc s financial results 
nonetheless  the final rule includes a wide range of provisions addressing the provision of transmission services  and as the new tariff is implemented there is likely to be an impact on ipc s transmission operations  planning and wholesale marketing functions 
ferc order pursuant to section of the fpa  on march   the ferc issued order no 
in which it approved of the reliability standards proposed by the north american electric reliability corporation nerc 
previously  the ferc certified the nerc as the electric reliability organization responsible for developing and enforcing mandatory reliability standards 
collectively  the reliability standards define overall acceptable performance with regard to operation  planning and design of the north american bulk power system 
as the ferc recognized in order no 
 most of these reliability standards were already being adhered to on a voluntary basis 
compliance with these standards became mandatory and subject to the ferc s penalty authority in june since then  additional reliability standards have been submitted  and will continue to be submitted  by the nerc to the ferc for approval 
ipc reviewed all requirements  procedures and documentation to ensure compliance with these standards and submitted all necessary information by the effective date of june  ipc certified its compliance with a subset of these standards the wecc actively monitored standards prior to the january  deadline 
ipc is subject to compliance spot checks beginning in order no 
substantially impacts documentation requirements  but is not expected to have a material impact on operations 
northern tier transmission group ipc  along with four other transmission owning entities covering all or parts of the transmission system in six western states  has formed the northern tier transmission group nttg 
the goal of the group is to improve overall operation and expansion of the high voltage transmission network 
the group continues to make progress on four major initiatives improving generation control performance the first generation control became operational in march  compliance with ferc order through cooperative efforts in developing process and information exchange  providing improved information on available transmission capacity  and conducting open  participatory transmission planning processes which will result in identifying specific transmission projects 
several projects have been identified for the fast track planning process and work has begun on engineering analysis 
one of these projects is ipc s joint project with pacificorp midamerican to evaluate building two high voltage transmission lines as discussed below gateway west project 
ferc order no 
required jurisdictional utilities to establish planning procedures  to which ipc responded by submitting its attachment k filing with the ferc on december  to date  the ferc has yet to accept or issue orders regarding any attachment k filings  including ipc s 
in addition to other activities  the nttg fulfills a significant portion of the sub regional and regional planning requirements specified in order  including the commencement of the nttg biennial planning process with a public stakeholder meeting held in january 
table of contents gateway west project ipc and pacificorp are jointly exploring the gateway west project to build two kv lines between the jim bridger plant in wyoming and boise 
the lines would be designed to increase electrical transmission capacity across southern idaho in response to increasing customer demand and growth 
this project has been submitted to the western electricity coordinating council wecc for the first phases of the ratings process 
a review team has been established from members of the wecc to analyze the impact of the project on the existing system 
when the study is complete  necessary modifications will be made to the engineering design and the final rating will be obtained prior to the beginning of construction 
planning and project management personnel for both companies have begun the initial phases of this project 
ipc and pacificorp have a cost sharing agreement for expenses associated with the analysis work of the initial phases 
it is expected that the majority of the project would be completed between and depending on the timing of rights of way acquisition  siting and permitting  and construction sequencing 
if the project is constructed  ipc estimates that its share of project costs would be between million and billion 
hemingway boardman line consistent with the irp and requirements of other transmission customer requirements  ipc is exploring alternatives for the construction of a kv line between southwestern idaho and the northwest 
if built  this line could be in service as early as several electric utilities  including ipc  have proposed development of a transmission station near boardman  oregon which would serve as the northwest terminal of the project 
the idaho terminal would be the proposed hemingway station located in the vicinity of melba and murphy on the south side of the snake river near boise 
ipc and a number of other utilities with proposed regional transmission projects in the northwest have signed a letter agreeing to coordinate technical studies  which have begun 
other planning and project management activities are underway 
ipc has received inquiries about participating in this project from other parties 
the proposed gateway west and hemingway boardman transmission projects will be used both by wholesale transmission customers and to serve ipc s native load consistent with our oatt 
therefore these facilities will be subject to both the ferc and state public utility commission regulation and rate making policies 
public utility regulatory policies act of as mandated by the enactment of purpa and the adoption of avoided cost rates by the ipuc and the opuc  ipc has entered into contracts for the purchase of energy from a number of private developers 
under these contracts  ipc is required to purchase all of the output from the facilities located inside the ipc service territory 
for projects located outside the ipc service territory  ipc is required to purchase the output that ipc has the ability to receive at the facility s requested point of delivery on the ipc system 
the ipuc jurisdictional portion of the costs associated with cspp contracts are fully recovered through base rates and the pca 
for ipuc jurisdictional contracts  projects that generate up to ten average mw of energy on a monthly basis are eligible for ipuc published avoided costs for up to a year contract term 
the published avoided cost is a price established by the ipuc and the opuc to estimate ipc s cost of developing additional generation resources 
as discussed more fully in wind integration costs below  on august   the ipuc granted a temporary reduction in the eligible project size to kw for intermittent generation resources only and ordered ipc to study the impacts of integrating this type of resource 
for opuc jurisdictional contracts  projects with a nameplate rating of up to ten mw of capacity are eligible for opuc published avoided costs for up to a year contract term 
the opuc jurisdictional portion of the costs associated with cspp contracts is recovered through general rate case filings 
the oregon provisions are currently being reviewed in an opuc proceeding 
if a purpa project does not qualify for published avoided costs  then ipc is required to negotiate the terms  prices and conditions with the developer of that project 
these negotiations reflect the characteristics of the individual projects ie  operational flexibility  location and size and the benefits to the ipc system and must be consistent with other similar energy alternatives 
recent activities  including the extension of the federal production tax credit and the expansion of the tax credit eligibility to solar  geothermal and other forms of generation  resolution of ipuc and opuc purpa related hearings and a december   order by the ipuc increasing the published avoided costs  create a favorable climate for purpa project development  which may require ipc to enter into additional purpa agreements 
the requirement to enter into additional purpa agreements may result in ipc acquiring energy at above wholesale market prices  thus increasing costs to its customers 
it is highly likely that the requirement to enter into additional purpa agreements will add to ipc s surplus during certain times of the year  which could also increase costs to ipc s customers 
as of december   ipc had signed agreements to purchase energy from cspp facilities with contracts ranging from one to years 
of these facilities  were on line at the end of  the other facilities under contract are due to come on line in and during  ipc purchased  mwh from these projects at a cost of million  resulting in a blended price of cents per kilowatt hour 

table of contents wind integration costs under purpa  ipc is required to offer independent developers a power purchase contract based on a standard avoided cost rate for a qualifying facility with an output of ten average megawatts amw or less 
because a large number of wind project developers came to ipc requesting purpa contracts in early  ipc requested and the ipuc granted temporary relief from purpa requirements until the impact of wind integration could be more fully studied 
the ipuc granted this relief by temporarily reducing the purpa cap of amw to kw for purpa wind projects 
on february   ipc filed with the ipuc a wind integration study report along with a petition requesting removal of the temporary restriction on the size of purpa wind projects and adjustment of avoided cost rates to compensate for the increase in system costs due to wind variability 
on march   and june   public workshops were held to present the results of the study  which were contested by wind developers and advocates of wind generation resources 
in an attempt to settle the case  ipc entered into a settlement stipulation with renewable northwest project and the nw energy coalition on october  the settlement stipulation prescribed  among other things  a methodology for calculating a wind integration charge that will be applied to purpa wind projects 
the integration charge will be calculated as a percentage of the current year  levelized  avoided cost rate  subject to a cap of mwh 
on february   the ipuc issued an order approving the settlement stipulation and increasing the purpa cap back to ten amw 
cassia wind farm complaint on september   cassia gulch wind park  llc and cassia wind farm  llc collectively cassia filed a complaint against ipc with the ipuc requesting the ipuc to determine that the cost responsibility for specified transmission system upgrades to meet contingency planning conditions should not be assigned to purpa qualifying facilities connecting to the system  but rather should be rolled into ipc s plant in service rate base and recovered through rates to retail and transmission customers 
the estimated costs of transmission system upgrades included in this complaint that relate to connecting cassia to ipc s system were million 
comments were filed in october and november  and oral arguments were held in november on june   ipc and cassia filed a joint motion to dismiss the underlying complaint and to approve a related settlement stipulation 
the ipuc approved the joint motion on august  the key component of the stipulation is the concept of redispatch 
ipc s estimated cost of approximately million to complete necessary transmission network upgrades was based on the assumption that the requesting projects in the transmission queue would not be dispatchable 
under the stipulation  cassia agrees to install  at its expense  equipment and communication facilities necessary to reduce its energy output to a predetermined set point within ten minutes of when ipc requests the reduction 
based on these provisions  the original estimate of million decreased to approximately million 
under the stipulation  ipc would fund percent of any upgrade investment  which would be recoverable through rates  while the developer would fund percent that is non recoverable and percent that is recoverable over time 
the stipulation also addresses responsibility for network upgrade costs  sharing of network upgrade costs  refunds and interests on refunds and security for payment 
on october   the ipuc approved the application of this same cost allocation methodology to two purpa qualifying projects that were not parties to the cassia dispute and are in a different geographic region than the one impacted by the cassia transmission upgrades 
although the ipuc did not in the cassia proceeding approve broad application of the settlement to other projects  it did  in this case  determine that the circumstances were similar enough to warrant using the same cost allocation methodology 
purpa avoided cost rate computation on september   ipc filed an application with the ipuc requesting modification to the method of computing avoided cost rates 
these rates are used to set the price ipc pays to new purpa projects over the lives of the purchase agreements 
specifically  ipc requested that the fuel cost component of the computation be revised from a three year average natural gas price with a prescribed escalation factor to an average of the year forecast of median natural gas prices as published by the northwest power and conservation council nwpcc for ipc believes that failing to recognize the non linear shape of the nwpcc s forecast would cause the published rates to be much higher than they otherwise would be 
ipc did not propose to adjust any of the non fuel assumptions in the avoided cost rate computation 

table of contents avista corporation  rocky mountain power  and the ipuc staff filed comments supporting ipc s position but recommending that the fuel cost component be tied to each year in the nwpcc forecast rather than using an average of the twenty years 
the ipuc approved the application including the ipuc staff s recommended modification on december  integrated resource plan ipc filed its irp with the ipuc in september and with the opuc in october the irp previewed ipc s load and resource situation for the next years  analyzed potential supply side and demand side options and identified near term and long term actions 
the ipuc accepted the irp in march the opuc acknowledged the irp in september with the stipulation that ipc not commit to the construction of a mw pulverized coal resource  identified to come on line in  until ipc presents an update of the irp to the opuc no later than june with its acceptance of the irp  the ipuc requested that ipc align the submittal of its next irp with those submitted by other utilities 
to comply with this request ipc intends to provide an update on the status of the irp to both the ipuc and opuc no later than june and file a new irp in june during the time between resource plan filings  the public and regulatory oversight of the activities identified in the irp allows for discussion and adjustment of the irp as warranted 
ipc continues to analyze and evaluate the resource plan and make periodic adjustments and corrections to reflect changes in technology  economic conditions  anticipated resource development and regulatory requirements 
each of the sections below provides an update of items identified in the irp 
peaking resource construction of a new simple cycle combustion turbine resource at the danskin plant near mountain home  idaho is expected to be complete in the first quarter of the combustion turbine will provide approximately mw of capacity during summer load peaks and up to mw during winter 
ipc received a certificate of public convenience and necessity for this project on december   that included a construction cost commitment estimate of million and approval to include in rate base the prudent capital costs for construction and operating fuel 
the project is ahead of schedule and under the commitment estimate 
related transmission interconnection and line requirements are being completed by ipc at an estimated cost of million 
wind agreement in february  the ipuc approved a power purchase agreement with telocaset wind power partners  llc  a subsidiary of horizon wind energy  for mw nameplate of wind generation from the elkhorn valley wind project located in eastern oregon 
the project was constructed during and became commercially operational on december geothermal agreement an rfp for geothermal powered generation was released on june  ipc identified us geothermal  inc as the successful bidder in march based on a proposal to supply mw of geothermal energy 
on january   the ipuc approved a power purchase agreement for mw nameplate generation from the raft river geothermal power plant unit located in southern idaho 
this project began operating in october contract negotiations for the remaining mw will take place over the next several months and will include an additional unit at the raft river site on line and two units at the neal hot springs site located in eastern oregon on line and 
coal fired resource shift to natural gas fired resource the near term action plan in the irp indicated initial commitments to the construction of a coal fired resource would be necessary before the end of in order for a project to be on line in in order to meet this schedule  ipc screened and evaluated coal fired resources in and this evaluation concluded in august and the results indicated construction costs had escalated substantially since resource cost estimates were prepared for the irp 
due to escalating construction costs and continued uncertainty surrounding future ghg laws and regulations  ipc decided not to pursue the development of a coal based resource at this time 
however  ipc continues to evaluate other coal fired resource opportunities  including expansion of its jointly owned facilities  clean coal technologies and potential power purchase agreements 
in order to meet baseload deficiencies identified in  ipc has shifted its focus to the development of a combined cycle natural gas fired resource located closer to its load center in southern idaho 

table of contents additional rfps on january   ipc released an rfp for to mw of geothermal energy 
while additional geothermal resources were not included in the irp for this time frame  the development of purpa wind and combined heat and power projects has been slower than anticipated 
if competitively priced geothermal resources are available  they may help to meet future resource needs 
ipc also anticipates releasing an rfp in for mw from one or more combined heat and power projects 
relicensing of hydroelectric projects ipc  like other utilities that operate nonfederal hydroelectric projects on qualified waterways  obtains licenses for its hydroelectric projects from the ferc 
these licenses last for to years depending on the size  complexity  and cost of the project 
ipc is actively pursuing the relicensing of the hells canyon complex and swan falls projects 
hells canyon complex the most significant ongoing relicensing effort is the hells canyon complex hcc  which provides approximately two thirds of ipc s hydroelectric generating capacity and percent of its total generating capacity 
the current license for the hcc expired at the end of july until the new multi year license is issued  ipc operates the project under an annual license issued by the ferc 
the license application was filed in july and accepted by the ferc for filing in december the ferc is now processing the application consistent with the requirements of the fpa  the national environmental policy act of  as amended nepa  the energy policy act and other applicable federal laws 
consistent with the requirements of nepa  the ferc staff prepared and issued on august   a final environmental impact statement eis for the hcc  which the ferc will use to determine whether  and under what conditions  to issue a new license for the project 
the purpose of the final eis is to inform the ferc  the federal and state agencies  native american tribes and the public about the environmental effects of ipc s proposed operation of the hcc 
the final eis also considers reasonable alternatives to that proposed operation 
in this latter context  the ferc staff reviewed the comments and alternative proposals submitted by the agencies  tribes and the private interests and evaluated those alternatives as compared to measures proposed by ipc 
the final eis also contains a staff alternative  reflecting those instances where some modification to ipc s proposal is deemed advisable by the staff to address environmental impacts or concerns 
the ferc will consider the findings and proposals contained in the final eis  together with the other information and material filed in the relicensing proceeding  in the development of a license order for the hcc 
ipc s initial review of the final eis indicates that  in large measure  the findings and recommendations the staff alternative in the final eis are consistent with the draft eis issued by the ferc in july and that the final eis generally accepts the science  analysis and the proposed measures contained in ipc s license application and supporting documents 
ipc is continuing to review the final eis and expects to file comments on the final eis with the ferc in the first quarter of in conjunction with the issuance of the final eis  on september   the ferc requested formal consultation with the national marine fisheries service nmfs and the us fish and wildlife service usfws pursuant to section of the endangered species act esa with regard to the effect of relicensing the hcc on several aquatic and terrestrial species listed as threatened under the esa 
in subsequent correspondence these entities  the usfws and the nmfs advised the ferc that outstanding issues remain with regard to the licensing of the hcc and they did not have sufficient information to complete formal esa consultation on the project 
the agencies further advised that they were working with ipc and other state and federal agencies to address these outstanding issues 
ipc continues to cooperate with the usfws  the nmfs  and the ferc in an effort to address esa concerns associated with the relicensing of the hcc 
the ferc is not expected to issue a license order for the hcc until esa consultation is completed 
on january   ipc filed water quality certification applications  under section of the clean water act cwa  with the states of oregon and idaho 
because the hcc is located on the snake river where it forms the border between idaho and oregon  section of the cwa requires as a prerequisite to the licensing of the project by the ferc that each state certify that any discharge from the project complies with applicable state water quality standards 
ipc worked with the odeq and the ideq through on proposed water quality measures that would address water quality issues at the project 
however  because the cwa requires that a state agency act on a pending application within one year of its filing date  ipc found it necessary to withdraw its pending section applications on november  and re file new applications on that same date 
ipc filed supplemental information to the applications on february  ipc continues to work with the odeq and the ideq to ensure that state water quality standards will be met at the hcc so that the project can be appropriately certified 

table of contents at december   million of hcc relicensing costs were included in construction work in progress 
the relicensing costs are recorded and will be held in construction work in progress until a new multi year license is issued by the ferc  at which time the charges will be transferred to electric plant in service 
relicensing costs and costs related to a new license will be submitted to regulators for recovery through the ratemaking process 
swan falls project the license for the swan falls hydroelectric project expires in june on march   ipc issued a formal consultation package fcp to natural resource agencies  native american tribes and the public relating to environmental studies designed to determine project effects for the relicensing of the swan falls project 
based upon the results of those studies and the consultation with the agencies  tribes and the public  on september   ipc submitted its draft license application to ferc for public review and comment 
the draft contains project specific information and the results of the studies developed in the fcp 
comments were received from the agencies and one tribe and on february  a joint meeting was held to address the comments and attempt to resolve areas of disagreement over study results and proposed mitigation measures 
ipc will file a final license application with the ferc in june at december   million of swan falls project relicensing costs were included in construction work in progress 
the relicensing costs are recorded and will be held in construction work in progress until a new multi year license is issued by the ferc  at which time the charges will be transferred to electric plant in service 
relicensing costs and costs related to a new license will be submitted to regulators for recovery through the ratemaking process 
shoshone falls expansion on august   ipc filed a license amendment application with the ferc  which would allow ipc to upgrade the shoshone falls project from mw to mw 
in march  ipc received from the ferc a draft environmental assessment ea and notice of ready for environmental analysis  which provided for a day comment period for interested entities 
the ferc issued a supplemental ea on december  the license amendment could be issued in the first quarter in conjunction with the license amendment application  ipc has filed a water rights application which is currently being reviewed by the idwr 
ferc market based rate authority ipc has ferc approved market based rate authority  which permits ipc to sell electric energy at market based rates rather than being limited to cost based rates 
every three years  the ferc requires a review of the conditions under which this market based rate authority is granted to ensure that the rates charged thereunder are just and reasonable 
on april   the ferc issued an order indicating that is was reconsidering the rules  procedures and methodologies associated with such triennial filings 
in september  ipc filed a revision to its market power analysis based on historical data  which it supplemented in september and october on march   the ferc issued an order accepting ipc s market power analysis 
on june   the ferc issued a final rule  order no 
 revamping its market based rate program 
under order no 
 ipc s next triennial filing is not due until june  on december   the ferc staff requested that ipc perform a complete generation market power study for the ipc control area using historical data 
ipc filed a revised study with the ferc on february  the ferc accepted ipc s notice on june   confirming that ipc passed the market power analysis screens and maintained market based rate authority 
because ipc s new generating unit at its danskin plant  which has a capacity greater than mw  will soon be operational  ipc anticipates filing a notice of change in status with the ferc during the first quarter of other matters 
table of contents adopted accounting pronouncements fin in  idacorp and ipc adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin prescribes a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in a company s financial statements and also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the cumulative effect of adopting fin was recorded as a million increase in the opening balance in retained earnings 
new accounting pronouncements see note to idacorp s and ipc s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
inflation idacorp and ipc believe that inflation has caused and will continue to cause increases in certain operating expenses and the replacement of assets at higher costs 
inflation affects the cost of labor  products and services required for operations and maintenance and capital expenditures 
while inflation has not had a significant impact on idacorp s or ipc s operations  increases in utility expenses due to inflation could have an adverse effect on earnings because of the need to obtain regulatory approval to recover such increased expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk idacorp and ipc are exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates  changes in commodity prices  credit risk and equity price risk 
the following discussion summarizes these risks and the financial instruments  derivative instruments and derivative commodity instruments sensitive to changes in interest rates  commodity prices and equity prices that were held at december  interest rate risk idacorp and ipc manage interest expense and short and long term liquidity though a combination of fixed rate and variable rate debt 
generally  the amount of each type of debt is managed through market issuance  but interest rate swap and cap agreements with highly rated financial institutions may be used to achieve the desired combination 
variable rate debt as of december   idacorp and ipc had million and million  respectively  in net floating rate debt 
assuming no change in financial structure for either company  if variable interest rates were one percentage point higher than the rates in effect on december   interest rate expense would increase and pre tax earnings would decrease by approximately million for idacorp and million for ipc 
fixed rate debt as of december   idacorp and ipc had outstanding fixed rate debt of million and million  respectively  and the fair market value of this debt was million and million  respectively 
these instruments are fixed rate and  therefore  do not expose the companies to a loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million for idacorp and million for ipc if interest rates were to decline by one percentage point from their december  levels 
commodity price risk utility ipc s exposure to changes in commodity price is related to its ongoing utility operations producing electricity to meet the demand of its retail electric customers 
the weather is a major uncontrollable factor affecting the local and regional demand for electricity and the availability and price of production 
the objective of ipc s energy purchase and sale activity is to meet the demand of retail electric customers  maintain appropriate physical reserves to ensure reliability  and make economic use of temporary surpluses that may develop 
ipc s exposure to commodity price risk is largely offset by the previously discussed pca mechanism 
ipc has adopted a risk management program designed to reduce exposure to power supply cost related uncertainty  further mitigating commodity price risk 
this program has been reviewed and accepted by the ipuc 
ipc s energy risk management policy the policy describes a collaborative process with customers and regulators via a committee called the customer advisory group cag 
the risk management committee rmc  comprised of selected ipc officers and other senior staff  oversees the risk management program 
the rmc is responsible for communicating the status of risk management activities to the idacorp board of directors  and to the cag 

table of contents the policy requires monitoring monthly volumetric electricity position and total dollar net power supply cost exposure on a rolling month forward view 
the power supply business unit produces and evaluates projections of the operating plan and orders risk mitigating actions dictated by the limits stated in the policy 
the rmc evaluates the actions initiated by power supply for consistency and compliance with the policy 
ipc representatives meet with the cag at least annually to assess effectiveness of the limits 
changes to the limits can be endorsed by the cag and referred to the board of directors for approval 
the primary tools for risk mitigation are physical forward power transactions and fueling alternatives for utility owned generation resources 
credit risk utility ipc is subject to credit risk based on its activity with market counterparties 
ipc is exposed to this risk to the extent that a counterparty may fail to fulfill a contractual obligation to provide energy  purchase energy or complete financial settlement for market activities 
ipc mitigates this exposure by actively establishing credit limits  measuring  monitoring  reporting  using appropriate contractual arrangements and transferring of credit risk through the use of financial guarantees  cash or letters of credit 
a current list of acceptable counterparties and credit limits is maintained 
equity price risk idacorp and ipc are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets  primarily through their pension plan assets  a mine reclamation trust fund owned by an equity method investment of ipc and other equity investments at ipc 
a hypothetical ten percent decrease in equity prices would result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of financial instruments that are classified as available for sale securities
