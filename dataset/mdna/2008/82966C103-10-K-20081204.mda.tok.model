this discussion contains forward looking statements based on current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of certain events may differ significantly from those projected in such forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those set forth in results of operations in this item and elsewhere in this report 
except as otherwise disclosed all amounts are reported in us dollars 
overview sirona is a leading manufacturer of high tech dental equipment 
sirona focuses on developing innovative systems and solutions for dentists globally 
sirona has served equipment dealers and dentists worldwide for more than years 
the company has its headquarters in long island city  new york and its largest facility in bensheim  germany 
sirona manages its business on both a product and geographic basis and has four reporting segments dental cad cam systems  imaging systems  treatment centers and instruments 
products from each category are marketed in all geographical sales regions 
significant factors that affect sirona s results of operations increased focus on sirona s position in the us market and further global expansion the us market is the largest individual market for sirona 
over the last three fiscal years  sirona experienced strong revenue growth  with us dollar revenue  bolstered by the june acquisition of schick technologies  increasing on average by annually 
several products have generated significant interest in the us market  including  but not limited to  cerec  schick imaging products  galileos  the orthophos xg line  inlab  ineos  c  electrical handpieces and sirolaser 
sirona works together with large distributors in the us market  including patterson dental and henry schein  which accounted for and  respectively  of sirona s global revenues for the fiscal year ended september  the relationship with henry schein was expanded beyond the european markets to the united states in january patterson dental made a payment of million to sirona in july in exchange for the exclusive distribution right for cerec cad cam products in the united states and canada until the amount sirona received was recorded as deferred income and is being recognized on a straight line basis commencing at the beginning of the extension of the exclusivity period in fiscal focus on further global expansion in addition to increased us market growth  sirona has pursued expansion in the rest of the world 
over the last three fiscal years  sales in the rest of the world grew on average by annually 
to support this growth  sirona expanded its local presence and distribution channels by establishing new sales and service locations in spain  france and the united kingdom in  in japan and australia in  in china in and in italy in this expansion helped to increase sales and gross profit but also contributed to higher sg a expense 
changes in ownership of sirona the mdp transaction of june   as well as the eqt transaction of february   resulted in a change of ownership that was accounted for in a manner similar to a business combination under us gaap 
the results of operations of sirona and its legal  tax and financing structure have changed substantially as a result of the mdp transaction and the eqt transaction 
sirona s business was acquired by newly formed entities and sirona incurred substantial fees and expenses not related to its ongoing operations 
the assets and 
table of contents liabilities acquired were partially stepped up to fair value and a related deferred tax liability was recorded 
the excess of the total purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired  including ipr d projects which were expensed at the date of closing  was allocated to goodwill and is subject to periodic impairment testing 
sirona s cost of goods sold  research and development  selling  general and administrative expense and operating results have been and will continue to be materially affected by higher depreciation and amortization costs resulting from the step up to fair value of sirona s assets and liabilities 
taxes  interest and net income have also been and will continue to be substantially impacted by the structural changes resulting from the mdp transaction and the eqt transaction 
acquisition of schick technologies inc on june   the exchange with schick technologies inc was completed see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the results of operations and the cash flows for the year ended september   as well as the balance sheet as of september  have been affected by this reverse acquisition 
the schick assets and liabilities acquired were stepped up to their fair values and a related deferred tax liability was recorded 
the excess of the total purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired  including ipr d projects totaling million that were expensed at the acquisition date  was allocated to goodwill and is subject to periodic impairment testing 
as of september   the acquired ipr d projects  which primarily related to intra oral digital imaging  have been completed 
sirona s cost of goods sold  research and development  selling  general and administrative expense and operating results are materially affected by higher depreciation and amortization costs resulting from the inclusion of schick in its consolidated accounts 
taxes  interest and net income will also be impacted by the structural changes resulting from the exchange 
the acquisition generated operating synergies as anticipated 
transactions accounted for as business combinations ipr d projects acquired in connection with the exchange and the mdp transaction  with fair values of million and million  respectively  were appraised and charged to the income statement at the respective dates of acquisition 
the projects primarily related to i d imaging  ii enhancements to the cad cam system s hardware and software  iii the new treatment center platform and iv intra oral digital imaging 
the fair value of million in connection with the exchange related primarily to the intra oral digital imaging projects 
as of september   the d imaging  the new treatment center platform  the intra oral digital imaging  and the majority of the cad cam system s enhancements have been completed 
these projects are substantially complete 
the remaining estimated costs to complete the outstanding enhancement to the cad cam system at september  was million complete as at september  
we anticipate that this project will be completed in fiscal year and begin to generate cash in fiscal year there are no specific risks and uncertainties associated with these projects  however  the general risks relating to the company as discussed under risk factors may apply 
fluctuations in us dollar euro exchange rate although the us dollar is sirona s reporting currency  its functional currency varies depending on the country of operation 
for the fiscal year ended september   approximately of sirona s revenue and approximately of its expenses were in euros 
during the periods under review  the us dollar euro exchange rate has fluctuated significantly  thereby impacting sirona s financial results 
between september  and september   the us dollar euro exchange rate used to calculate items included in sirona s financial statements varied from a low of to a high of 
although sirona does not apply hedge accounting  sirona has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure 
as of september   these contracts had notional amounts totaling million 

table of contents because these agreements are relatively short term generally six months  continued fluctuation in the us dollar euro exchange rate could materially affect sirona s results of operations 
certain revenue information under results of operations below is presented on a constant currency basis 
this information is a non gaap financial measure 
sirona presents revenue on a constant currency basis because it believes this information facilitates a comparison of sirona s operating results from period to period without regard to changes resulting solely from fluctuations in currency rates 
sirona calculates constant currency revenue growth by comparing current period revenues to prior period revenues with both periods converted at the us dollar euro average foreign exchange rate for the current period 
the exchange rates used in converting euro denominated revenues into us dollar in the company s financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap were and for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively  based on the average of the foreign exchange rates for the individual quarters included within each year 
loans made to sirona under the new senior credit facility entered into on november  are denominated in the functional currency of the respective borrowers 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our new senior credit facility 
however  intercompany loans are denominated in the functional currency of only one of the parties to the loan agreements 
where intercompany loans are of a long term investment nature  the potential non cash revaluations due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates are reflected within other comprehensive income 
these fluctuations may be significant in any period due to changes in the exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar 
fluctuations in quarterly operating results sirona s quarterly operating results have varied in the past and are likely to vary in the future 
these variations result from a number of factors  many of which are substantially outside its control  including the timing of new product introductions by sirona or its competitors  the timing of industry trade shows  developments in government reimbursement policies  changes in product mix  sirona s ability to supply products to meet customer demand  fluctuations in manufacturing costs  income tax incentives  and currency fluctuation 
due to the variations which sirona has experienced in its quarterly operating results  it does not believe that period to period comparisons of results of operations of sirona are necessarily meaningful or reliable as indicators of future performance 
taxes the german tax authorities examined the tax returns for the fiscal years the results of the tax report issued upon completion of the audit have been fully reflected in our financial statements 
in august a new tax law was enacted in germany which was applicable for sirona s entire fiscal year the new law reduces corporate tax rates in germany and resulted in a revaluation of the deferred tax liabilities and assets  providing the company with a non cash tax benefit of million in fiscal furthermore  the lower german tax rates combined with tax planning initiatives resulted in a reduction of the effective tax rate for the year ended september  
table of contents results of operations the table below sets forth sirona s results of operations for the fiscal periods presented year ended september  year ended september  year ended september  s except for per share amounts revenue cost of sales gross profit operating expenses income selling  general and administrative expense research and development provision for doubtful accounts and notes receivable write off in process research and development net other operating income expenses operating income foreign currency transaction gain loss gain on derivative instruments interest expense  net loss on debt extinguishment other expense income income before taxes and minority interest income tax provision benefit minority interest net income net income per share basic diluted fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september  revenue revenue for the fiscal year ended september  was million  an increase of million  or  as compared with the fiscal year ended september  on a constant currency basis  adjusting for the fluctuations in the us dollar euro rate  total revenue increased by 
growth rates were up on a constant currency basis for the treatment center segment  up on a constant currency basis for the instruments segment  up on a constant currency basis for the cad cam systems segment  and up on a constant currency basis for the imaging systems segment 
the treatment center revenue growth was primarily driven by sirona s expanded presence in italy and japan and a strong business in the middle east and south east asia 
the instruments segment development was mainly driven by strong hygiene product sales as well as increased sales in several european countries like france  the uk  benelux and scandinavia 
dental cad cam systems segment revenue growth was favorably impacted by the positive reception of our new mc xl milling machine in the market place 
mc xl trade in programs for the existing cerec users contributed positively to the revenue growth 

table of contents the imaging systems segment development was attributable to the continued adoption of digital radiography and sales of galileos  the d digital panoramic imaging unit 
revenue growth in all segments was mainly volume driven 
prices in general remained stable  with some pricing pressure in the panoramic imaging product lines 
the regional development demonstrates that sirona continues to benefit from its geographical diversification 
revenue in the united states for the fiscal year ended september  increased by compared to the prior year  whereas revenue growth outside of the united states was 
on a constant currency basis  adjusting for the fluctuations in the us dollar euro exchange rate  revenue in the rest of the world increased by

gross profit margins were negatively impacted by the strengthening of the euro relative to the us dollar  as the majority of the expenses are euro denominated 
the gross profit margin for the instrument  imaging systems and treatment center segments are at or above the prior year levels  while the trade in programs for the mc xl unit resulted in a lower gross profit margin for the cad cam systems segment 
the flat development of the imaging systems gross profit margin resulted from a favorable product mix  which was offset by pricing pressure in panoramic imaging product lines 
selling  general and administrative for the fiscal year ended september   sg a expense was million  an increase of million  or  as compared with the fiscal year ended september  sg a expense included amortization and depreciation resulting from the step up to fair values of tangible and intangible assets of million  as well as non cash option expense in the amount of million for the fiscal year ended september   compared with million and million  respectively  for the fiscal year ended september  excluding these amounts  as a percentage of revenue  sg a expense increased to for the fiscal year ended september  as compared with for the fiscal year ended september  the increase in sg a was primarily due to the strengthening of the euro relative to the us dollar as most of the expenses are euro denominated  expenses associated with the growth in revenue and with sirona s expanded presence in various markets  including italy and japan

interest expense net interest expense for the year ended september  was million  compared to million for the year ended september  this decrease was primarily due to lower libor and euribor rates 
debt extinguishment the retirement of the borrowings under the company s previous credit facilities  the senior syndicated loan tranches a  b and c and the mezzanine loan facility was accounted for as a debt extinguishment in accordance with sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
the unscheduled repayment of the mezzanine facility by the company resulted in a prepayment fee of million euro million 
in addition  million of unamortized debt issue costs relating to the previous credit facilities were written off 
as a result  a loss on debt extinguishment totaling million was recognized in the year ended september  
table of contents income tax provision benefit for the fiscal years ended september  and  sirona realized a profit before income taxes and minority interest of million and million  respectively

growth rates were up on a constant currency basis for the imaging systems segment  up on a constant currency basis for the instruments segment  up on a constant currency basis for the cad cam systems segment  and up on a constant currency basis for the treatment center segment 
the positive imaging systems segment development in the fiscal year ended september  was attributable to the inclusion of the schick operations for the full year  the continued adoption of digital radiography  and initial sales of the d digital panoramic imaging unit galileos  which was launched in early while sales of galileos contributed to the increase  the company experienced a longer than expected sales cycle  as new product offerings entering the d digital marketplace caused the dental community to take longer to evaluate all of the available options 
the instruments segment revenue increase resulted  in part from new products  such as endodontic applications  from multi unit contract sales in emerging markets and a strong performance in germany 
dental cad cam systems segment revenue growth was impacted by the launch of our new mc xl milling machine  which started shipping in march the first half of the year had negative year over year cad cam segment growth due to i challenging year over year comparisons and ii investment caution as customers held back purchases of cad cam systems in anticipation of the launch and delivery of our new milling unit 
the second half of the year had strong cad cam revenue growth as the mc xl was well received in the marketplace 
together with our distribution partners  we implemented a trade in program for existing cerec users in the fourth quarter of fiscal year this trade in program contributed positively to our fourth quarter revenue development

revenue growth in all segments was mainly volume driven while prices in general remained stable 
revenue in the united states for the fiscal year ended september  increased by compared to the same period last year

the gross margin development was positively impacted by the addition of schick s product lines for the full fiscal year  the launch of our d imaging unit galileos as well as strong german sales and a favorable product mix in the treatment center segment 
these positive developments were partly offset by the trade in program for the new mc xl milling unit as well as higher manufacturing costs and start up expenses

other financial data unaudited year ended september  year ended september  year ended september  s net income net interest expense provision benefit for income taxes depreciation amortization ebitda ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is reconciled to net income  its most directly comparable us gaap measure  in the accompanying financial tables 
ebitda is defined as net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization 
sirona s management utilizes ebitda as an operating performance measure in conjunction with us gaap measures  such as net income and gross margin calculated in conformity with us gaap 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with us gaap 
there are material limitations associated with making the adjustments to sirona s earnings to calculate ebitda and using this non gaap financial measure 
for instance  ebitda does not include interest expense  and because sirona has borrowed money in order to finance its operations  interest expense is a necessary element of its costs and ability to generate revenue  depreciation and amortization expense  and because sirona uses capital and intangible assets  depreciation and amortization expense is a necessary element of its costs and ability to generate revenue  and tax expense  and because the payment of taxes is part of sirona s operations  tax expense is a necessary element of costs and impacts sirona s ability to operate 
in addition  other companies may define ebitda differently 
ebitda  as well as the other information in this filing  should be read in conjunction with sirona s consolidated financial statements and footnotes 
in addition to ebitda  the accompanying financial tables also set forth certain supplementary information that sirona believes is useful for investors in evaluating sirona s underlying operations 
this supplemental information includes gains losses recorded in the periods presented which relate to the early extinguishment of 
table of contents debt  share based compensation  revaluation of the us dollar denominated exclusivity payment and borrowings where the functional currency is the euro  and the exchange 
sirona s management believes that these items are either nonrecurring or noncash in nature  and should be considered by investors in assessing sirona s financial condition  operating performance and underlying strength 
sirona s management uses ebitda together with this supplemental information as an integral part of its reporting and planning processes and as one of the primary measures to  among other things i monitor and evaluate the performance of sirona s business operations  ii facilitate management s internal comparisons of the historical operating performance of sirona s business operations  iii facilitate management s external comparisons of the results of its overall business to the historical operating performance of other companies that may have different capital structures and debt levels  iv analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments  and v plan for and prepare future annual operating budgets and determine appropriate levels of operating investments 
sirona s management believes that ebitda and the supplemental information provided is useful to investors as it provides them with disclosures of sirona s operating results on the same basis as that used by sirona s management

there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to sirona s estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in its estimates and assumptions from time to time 
the following accounting policies are those that sirona believes to be the most sensitive to its estimates and assumptions 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue  net of related discounts and allowances  is recognized when persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss has passed to customers based on the shipping terms 
returns of products  excluding warranty related returns  are infrequent and insignificant 
revenue related to products that contain software that is more than incidental to the product is recognized in accordance with aicpa statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended sop 
for orders which contain one or more elements to be delivered at a future date  but do not include software that is more than incidental to the other elements  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
for revenue on certain cerec units recognized in accordance with both sop and eitf  the company allocates revenues between the various elements using the relative fair value method because vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe exists for all elements 
under the relative fair value method  as applied by the company  the revenue is allocated between the elements of the arrangement in proportion to the vsoe of each element 
the revenue allocated to the service contract is deferred until the service is provided 
for revenue on certain galileos units recognized in accordance with both sop and eitf  the company allocates revenues between the various elements using the residual method because vsoe exists for the undelivered service contract but does not exist for the delivered product 
under the residual method  as applied by the company  the revenue is allocated first to the undelivered elements based on vsoe and the residual contract amount is then allocated to the delivered element 
the revenue allocated to the service contract is deferred until the service is provided 
the revenue allocated to the cerec or galileos product sold  which contains software and hardware the functionality of which is dependent on the software and for which the software is integral ie  software related hardware  is recognized as revenue upon delivery which is when the risk and rewards of ownership are transferred

amounts received from customers in advance of product shipment are classified as deferred income until the revenue can be recognized in accordance with the company s revenue recognition policy 
pensions and k plan the company has defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans and an early retirement plan 
as of september   the company adopted the recognition provisions of financial accounting standard no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas 
upon adoption of sfas  sirona recognized as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income the funded status of its benefit plans  measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of september   net of related tax effects 
beginning in fiscal  sirona recognized changes in the funded status of its benefit plans  not yet recognized in the income statement  in other comprehensive income until they are amortized as a component of net periodic benefit cost 

table of contents the impact of the adoption of sfas as of september  is summarized in the following table and reflects the recognition of the unrecognized actuarial gains as of september  within accumulated other comprehensive income  net of related tax effects before application of statement adjustments after application of statement s deferred tax assets non current total assets liability for pension benefits total liabilities accumulated other comprehensive income total stockholders equity pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over the employee s approximate service periods 
defined benefit pension costs are determined by using an actuarial method  which provides for the deferral of actuarial gains and losses in excess of a specified corridor that result from changes in assumptions or actual experience differing from that assumed 
costs relating to changes in the benefit plan as well as the transition obligation are amortized 
disclosure of the components of periodic pension cost are also required 
when purchase accounting is applied  pension liabilities are recognized for the projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets 
the key assumption used in the actuarial calculations for the defined benefit pension plans is the selection of the appropriate discount rate 
the discount rate has been selected by reference to market interest rates 
the discount rate used reflects the rates available on high quality fixed income investment of appropriate duration at the measurement dates of each year 
fluctuations in market interest rates could impact the amount of pension expense recorded for these plans 
the discount rate assumption changed from at september  to at september  thereby affecting the amount of pension expense recorded during each period 
plan assets consist of contributions made by sirona to a pension support fund of an insurance company  the custodian  which in turn invests these contributions 
the insurance company guarantees the employees the investments will generate a minimum return of 
the plan assets are invested in equity securities  fixed income securities and other assets 
as of september  there were actuarial gains that will be amortized through the corridor approach method during the years of service remaining beginning fiscal year the reasons for the appearance of these gains are the increase of the retirement age in germany and the increase of the discount rate 
contributions made to the defined contribution pension plans and the k savings plan for us employees are accrued based on the contributions required by the plan 
the company also has an early retirement plan  altersteilzeit atz  which allows certain german employees who have been accepted into the plan to retire at rather than at the legal retirement age of eligible employees are those who have attained the age of or who will attain the age of by calendar year and have been accepted to participate in the atz plan 
the atz plan can cover a period between the ages of to of the participating employees and is split into an active service period  where the employees work full time for the company  and an inactive service period  where the employees do not work for the company 
during the active service period  the employees receive of their salary and the remaining of their salary  plus a bonus payment equal to of their salary is paid during the inactive service period 
the company recognizes the salary component of the atz plan over the period from the beginning of the atz period to the end of the active service period 
the company recognizes the bonus component over the period from the point at which the employee signs the atz contract until the end of the active service period 

table of contents income taxes sirona recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
sirona regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance  as necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
if sirona is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  it could be required to increase its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in its effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results 
as of september   sirona had recorded valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets in the amount of million 
further information on income taxes is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
effective at the beginning of  the company adopted financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
further information may be found in note  income taxes in the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies  together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that the company determines all or part of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable in the future  the company will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance that would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of fin and other complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectations could have a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results 
impairment of long lived and finite lived assets sirona assesses all its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 
sirona s management assesses whether there has been an impairment by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from operating activities with the carrying value of the asset 
the factors considered by sirona s management in this assessment include operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
if an impairment is deemed to exist  management records an impairment charge equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the impaired assets 
this could result in a material charge to earnings 
impairment of indefinite lived assets sirona tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the fair value of its reporting units to their carrying values 
key assumptions in determining fair value are the assessment of future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate 
additionally  goodwill is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of an entity below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances would include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill impairment loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of goodwill over its implied fair value 
the implied fair value requires a fair value exercise similar to a business combination where the individual assets and liabilities are valued at fair value with the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit being the implied fair value of goodwill 
sirona evaluates trademarks  which are considered indefinite lived intangible assets  for impairment at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value might be impaired 
in performing this assessment  sirona s management considers operating results  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of 
table of contents obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors 
the carrying value of trademarks is considered impaired when their carrying value exceeds their fair market value 
in such an event  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount of that excess 
key assumptions in determining fair value include using the projected cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
purchase accounting sirona has recorded a change in basis of the assets and liabilities acquired in the exchange  the mdp transaction and eqt transaction 
these transactions required the assets and liabilities to be recorded either at partial fair value or fair value as described in note to sirona s consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this document 
in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities  sirona is required to make certain key assumptions that could materially impact the value of the assets or liabilities recorded 
in valuing the intangible assets  the key assumptions include the valuation method selected  the cash flow projections  the risk based discount rate  the replacement costs and or the applicable royalty rates 
sirona used its historical experience  budgets and similar assumptions used in the medical devices industry in formulating these assumptions 
in valuing property  plant and equipment  the fair values were derived from posted values for comparable assets and replacement values 
fair value of liabilities was determined to be equivalent to the predecessors carrying value or acquired company s fair value except for pension obligations  which were valued at the project benefit obligation measured in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 employer s accounting for pensions
