item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary amylin pharmaceuticals  inc is a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of people with diabetes  obesity and other diseases through the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative medicines 
we have developed and gained approval for two first in class medicines to treat diabetes  byetta exenatide injection and symlin pramlintide acetate injection  both of which were commercially launched in the united states during the second quarter of byetta has also been approved in the european union  or eu  and our collaboration partner  eli lilly and company  or lilly launched byetta in countries outside of the united states during we expect lilly to continue to launch byetta in additional eu member states and other countries in byetta is the first and only approved medicine in a new class of compounds called incretin mimetics 
we began selling byetta in the united states in june byetta is approved in the united states for the treatment of patients with type diabetes who have not achieved adequate glycemic control and are using metformin  a sulfonylurea and or a thiazolidinedone  or tzd  three common oral therapies for type diabetes 
net product sales of byetta were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we have an agreement with lilly for the global development and commercialization of exenatide 
this agreement includes byetta and any sustained release formulations of exenatide such as exenatide once weekly formerly referred to as exenatide lar  our once weekly formulation of exenatide for the treatment of type diabetes 
under the terms of the agreement  operating profits from products sold in the united states are shared equally between lilly and us 
the agreement provides for tiered royalties payable to us by lilly based upon the annual gross margin for all exenatide product sales  including any long acting release formulations  outside of the united states 
royalty payments for exenatide product sales outside of the united states will commence after a one time cumulative gross margin threshold amount has been met 
we expect royalty payments to commence in lilly is responsible for of the costs related to development of twice daily byetta for sale outside of the united states 
development costs related to all other exenatide products for sale outside of the united states will continue to be allocated to lilly and to us 
lilly will continue to be responsible for of the costs related to commercialization of all exenatide products for sale outside of the united states 
symlin is the first and only approved medicine in a new class of compounds called amylinomimetics 
we began selling symlin in the united states in april for the treatment of patients with either type or type diabetes who are treated with mealtime insulin but who have not achieved adequate glycemic control 
net product sales of symlin were million  million and million for the years ended december   and respectively 
we have a field force of approximately people dedicated to marketing byetta and symlin in the united states 
our field force includes our specialty and primary care sales forces  a managed care and government affairs organization  a medical science organization and diabetes care specialists 
in addition  lilly co promotes byetta in the united states and has primary responsibility for developing and commercializing byetta outside of the united states  and any sustained release formulations of exenatide such as exenatide once weekly 
in addition to our marketed products  we are working with lilly and alkermes  inc to develop exenatide once weekly 
we are also working with alkermes and parsons  inc on the construction of a manufacturing facility for exenatide once weekly in ohio 
we expect to complete the commercial scale manufacturing process in this facility in the second half of and we are also working aggressively to provide sufficient data to the united states food and drug administration  or fda  to demonstrate comparability between exenatide once weekly clinical trial material manufactured by our partner  alkermes  in its facility and exenatide once weekly produced in our west chester  ohio facility 
we also have other early stage programs for diabetes  obesity  and other therapeutic areas 
we have a number of compounds in development for the potential treatment of obesity which are part of a broader clinical strategy which we refer to as into integrated neurohormonal therapies for obesity 
we also maintain an active discovery research program focused on novel peptide therapeutics 
we are actively seeking to in license additional drug candidates 
we have partnered with pyschogenics  inc  to form psylin neurosciences  inc  a company that will focus on the discovery and development of peptide hormones for treatment of psychiatric indications 
during the second quarter of  we made a strategic equity investment in bioseek  inc  or bioseek  a com pany that specializes in predictive human cell based disease models  and contracted with bioseek to assess the potential utility of amylin s peptide hormones in immune inflammatory disorders 
during the fourth quarter of  we made a strategic equity investment in xenome ltd  or xenome  a company with largely venom based peptide libraries  and contracted with xenome to discover and develop novel peptide therapeutics for a range of metabolic and musculoskeletal diseases 
recent developments diabetes announced positive results from a week comparator study of exenatide once weekly injection and byetta taken twice daily in patients with type diabetes 
we anticipate a regulatory submission to the fda by the end of the first half of announced positive results from a week study of monotherapy  or stand alone  byetta in drug na ve patients with type diabetes 
we plan for a regulatory submission for a monotherapy indication to the fda in the first half of received fda approval of the symlinpen tm and the symlinpen tm pen injector devices for administering symlin 
these new pre filled pen injector devices feature simple  fixed dosing to improve mealtime glucose control 
this new product presentation was commercially launched in the united states in january announced plans for a clinical program for exenatide once weekly consisting of three trials designed to show superiority of exenatide once weekly for the treatment of type diabetes over common medications used in the treatment of type diabetes  including tzds  dpp iv inhibitors and insulin glargine 
the first of these trials is underway 
results from the first two studies are expected during the first half of and results from the third study are expected by early made continued progress and expanded the scope of the construction of our manufacturing facility for exenatide once weekly in ohio 
we remain on schedule to complete the commercial scale manufacturing process at this facility in the second half of obesity positive results from a week proof of concept study with pramlintide  an analog of human amylin  and recombinant human leptin metreleptin combination treatment in overweight or obese subjects  validating our novel into strategy 
we plan for additional development in  including the initiation of a phase b study and development work on a formulation that will provide both pramlintide and metreleptin in a single injection 
financial and operational in june  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in  referred to as the notes  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
in december  we entered into a million credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a million term loan  which generated net proceeds of approximately million  and a million revolving credit facility 
since our inception in september  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs and  more recently  to the commercialization of our products and the ongoing construction of our manufacturing facility for exenatide once weekly 
all of our revenues prior to the second quarter of were derived from fees and expense reimbursements under our byetta collaboration agreement with lilly  previous symlin collaborative agreements  and previous co promotion agreements 
during the second quarter of  we began to derive revenues from product sales of byetta and symlin 
we have been unprofitable since inception and may incur additional operating losses for at least the next few years 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately billion 
at december   we had billion in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we may not generate positive operating cash flows for at least the next few years and accordingly  we may need to raise additional funds from outside sources 
refer to the discussions under the headings liquidity and capital resources below and cautionary factors that may affect future results in part i  item a for further discussion regarding our anticipated future capital requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation  inventory costs  research and development expenses and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note to our consolidated financial statements on page f 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  license fees and milestones earned and for reimbursement of development costs based on contractual arrangements 
net product sales we sell our products primarily to wholesale distributors  who in turn  sell to retail pharmacies  pharmacy benefit managers and government entities 
decisions made by these wholesalers and their customers regarding the level of inventories they hold  and thus the amount of product they purchase  can materially affect the level of our product sales in any particular period 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when delivery has occurred and title has transferred to our wholesale customers  net of allowances for product returns  rebates and wholesaler chargebacks  wholesaler discounts and prescription vouchers 
we are required to make significant judgments and estimates in determining some of these allowances 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we will be required to make adjustments to these allowances in the future 
product returns we do not offer our wholesale customers a general right of return 
however  we will accept returns of products that are damaged or defective when received by the wholesale customer or for any unopened product during the period beginning six months prior to and up to months subsequent to its expiration date 
we estimate product returns based on our historical returns experience  and industry trends for other products with similar characteristics 
additionally  we consider several other factors in our estimation process including our internal sales forecasts  the expiration dates of product shipped and third party data to assist us in monitoring estimated channel inventory levels and prescription trends 
actual returns could exceed our historical experience and our estimates of expected future returns due to factors such as wholesaler and retailer stocking patterns and inventory levels and or competitive changes 
to date actual returns have not differed materially from our estimates 
rebates and wholesaler chargebacks allowances for rebates include mandated discounts under the medicaid drug rebate program and contracted discounts with commercial payors 
rebates are amounts owed after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant and are based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector eg medicaid benefit providers 
the allowance for rebates is based on contractual discount rates  expected utilization under each contract and our estimate of the amount of inventory in the distribution channel that will become subject to such rebates 
our estimates for expected utilization for rebates are based on historical rebate claims and to a lesser extent third party market research data 
rebates are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears so that our accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates and an accrual for inventory in the distribution channel 
wholesaler chargebacks are discounts that occur when contracted customers purchase directly from an intermediary wholesale purchaser 
contracted customers  which currently consist primarily of federal government entities purchasing off the federal supply schedule  generally purchase the product at its contracted price  plus a mark up from the wholesaler 
the wholesaler  in turn  charges back to the company the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contracted price paid to the wholesaler by the customer 
the allowance for wholesaler chargebacks is based on expected utilization of these programs and reported wholesaler inventory levels 
actual rebates and wholesaler chargebacks could exceed historical experience and our estimates of future participation in these programs 
to date  actual rebate claims and wholesaler chargebacks have not differed materially from our estimates 
wholesaler discounts wholesaler discounts consist of prompt payment discounts and distribution service fees 
we offer all of our wholesale customers a prompt pay discount within the first days after the date of the invoice 
distribution service fees arise from contractual agreements with certain of our wholesale customers for distribution services they provide to us and are generally a fixed percentage of their purchases of our products in a given period 
prompt payment discounts and distribution service fees are recorded as a reduction to gross sales in the period the sales occur 
the allowance for wholesaler discounts is based upon actual data of product sales to wholesale customers and not on estimates 
prescription vouchers prescription vouchers result in amounts owed to pharmacies that have redeemed vouchers for a free prescription 
we provide prescription vouchers to physicians  who in turn distribute them to patients 
patients may redeem a voucher at a pharmacy for a free prescription 
we reimburse the pharmacy for the price it paid the wholesaler for the medicine and record this reimbursement as a reduction to gross sales 
the allowance for prescription vouchers is based on the number of unredeemed vouchers in circulation  and the estimated utilization rate 
the estimated utilization rate is based on our historical utilization rates experience with prescription vouchers 
the allowance for prescription vouchers could exceed historical experience and our estimates of future utilization rates 
to date  actual prescription voucher utilization has not differed materially from our estimates 
revenues under collaborative agreements amounts received for upfront product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
non refundable amounts received for substantive milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone and the expiration of stock conversion rights  if any  associated with such payments 
amounts received for equalization of development expenses are recognized in the period in which the related expenses are incurred 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
valuation of stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation to employees in accordance with financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires us to expense the estimated fair value of non cash  stock based payments to employees 
we estimate the fair value of stock based payments to employees using the black scholes model 
this estimate is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of inputs that require us to make significant estimates and judgments 
these inputs include the expected volatility of our stock price  the expected term of employee stock options  the risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate volatility based upon the historical volatility of our common stock for a period corresponding to the expected term of our employee stock options and the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock with various maturities between six months and two years  consistent with the guidance in sfas no 
r and the security and exchange commission s  or sec s  staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we estimated volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock for a period corresponding to the expected term of our employee stock options 
the determination to use implied volatility in addition to historical volatility was based upon the availability of data related to actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that the addition of implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility alone 
the expected life of our employee stock options represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding in consideration of historical exercise patterns and the assumption that all outstanding options will be exercised at the mid point of the then current date and their maximum contractual term 
the risk free interest rates are based on the yield curve of united states treasury strip securities in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of our employee stock options 
we have never paid dividends and do not anticipate doing so for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we have assumed no dividend yield for purposes of estimating the fair value of our stock based payments to employees 
if factors underlying the above assumptions change in future periods  the associated estimated non cash  stock based compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
inventories and related reserves inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods for symlin and byetta 
we maintain inventory reserves primarily for production failures and potential product expiration 
the manufacturing processes for our products are complex 
deviations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures and additional inventory reserves 
obsolete inventory due to expiration may also result in additional inventory reserves 
in estimating inventory obsolescence reserves  we analyze the shelf life  expiration dates and internal sales forecasts  each on a product by product basis 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries  benefits  bonus  stock based compensation  license fees  milestones under license agreements  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  and develop drug materials and delivery devices  and associated overhead expenses and facilities costs 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
invoicing from third party contractors for services performed can lag several months 
we accrue the costs of services rendered in connection with third party contractor activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and monitoring costs and data management costs 
differences between actual clinical trial costs from estimated clinical trial costs have historically not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
income taxes we have net deferred tax assets relating primarily to net operating loss carry forwards and research and development tax credits 
subject to certain limitations  these deferred tax assets may be used to offset taxable income in future periods 
since we have been unprofitable since inception and the likelihood of future profitability is not assured  we have reserved for most of these deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and  respectively 
if we determine that we are able to realize a portion or all of these deferred tax assets in the future  we will record an adjustment to increase their recorded value and a corresponding adjustment to increase income in that same period 
we adopted the provisions of fin and fsp fin effective january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we had no cumulative effect adjustment related to the adoption due to a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
we provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits 
these unrecognized tax benefits relate primarily to issues common among corporations in our industry 
we apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include advice from industry and subject experts  evaluation of public actions taken by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities  as well as our own industry experience 
if our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes  our results could be materially impacted 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no

 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities 
eitf issue no 
requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
such amounts should be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
entities should continue to evaluate whether they expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
the adoption of eitf issue no

results of operations net product sales net product sales for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively  and consisted of sales of byetta and symlin  less allowances for product returns  rebates and wholesaler chargebacks  wholesaler discounts  and prescription vouchers 
the following table provides information regarding net product sales in millions year ended december  byetta symlin the increases in net product sales for byetta and symlin for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in and for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily reflects continued growth in patient use 
revenues under collaborative agreements the following table summarizes the components of revenues under collaborative agreements for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  amortization of up front payments recognition of milestone payments cost sharing payments substantially all of the revenue recorded in these periods consists of amounts earned pursuant to our byetta collaboration agreement with lilly and consists primarily of the continued amortization of up front payments  milestone payments and cost sharing payments to equalize development expenses for byetta and exenatide once weekly 
the million increase in revenues under collaborative agreements in  as compared to  primarily reflects increases in milestone and cost sharing payments related to our collaboration agreement with lilly 
milestone payments in consisted of the recognition of milestones earned primarily associated with lilly s launch of byetta in the eu 
the increase in cost sharing payments in  as compared to primarily reflects lilly s reimbursement to us of increased development expenses incurred by us for exenatide once weekly 
the million decrease in revenues under collaborative agreements in  as compared to  primarily reflects a reduction in milestone payments  partially offset by an increase in cost sharing payments 
milestone payments in consisted of the recognition of million of milestones earned in connection with the regulatory approval and commercial launch of byetta in the united states 
the increase in cost sharing payments in  as compared to primarily reflects increased development expenses for exenatide once weekly 
in future periods  revenues under collaborative agreements will consist of ongoing cost sharing payments from lilly to equalize development costs  possible future milestone payments and the continued amortization of the up front payment 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was million  representing a gross margin of  million  representing a gross margin of  and million  representing a gross margin of  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs of goods sold is comprised primarily of manufacturing costs associated with byetta and symlin sales during the period 
the improvement in gross margin in as compared to and in as compared to primarily reflects a higher average net sales price per unit for byetta and lower unit costs for byetta resulting from higher production volumes 
quarterly fluctuations in gross margins may be influenced by product mix and the level of sales allowances 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase in as compared to reflects the full annual effect of the expansion of our sales force during the fourth quarter of  increased promotional expenses for byetta and symlin  increased business infrastructure to support our growth and an increase in stock based compensation including costs associated with the adoption of our employee stock ownership plan  or esop  and increased expense from stock options due to growth in our number of employees 
the million increase in as compared to primarily reflects the full annual effect of the expansion of our commercial capabilities to support the launches of byetta and symlin  the continued expansion in of these capabilities  including the addition of approximately individuals to our field force  increased marketing activities  including medical education  market research and product sampling for byetta  growth in our business infrastructure and million of stock based compensation 
we  along with lilly  are jointly responsible for the co promotion of byetta within the united states  and share equally in sales force costs and external marketing expenses 
accordingly  our selling  general and administrative expenses include our share of these costs in the united states 
selling general and administrative expenses are expected to continue to increase in due to continued investment in promotional activities for byetta and symlin  investment in prelaunch education activities for exenatide once weekly  and increases in business infrastructure to support our growth 
research and development expenses currently  our research and development efforts are focused on programs for the treatment of diabetes and obesity in various stages of development 
from inception through  we devoted substantially all of our research and development efforts to symlin 
beginning in  our research and development costs started to include costs for our other drug candidates  primarily byetta and exenatide once weekly 
in we initiated our program for the treatment of obesity with pramlintide and in we commenced our into clinical research program for obesity 
the drug development process in the united states includes a series of steps defined by the fda 
the process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation leading up to the submission of an ind to the fda  which allows for the initiation of the clinical evaluation of a potential drug candidate in humans 
clinical evaluation is typically comprised of three phases of study phase  phase and phase generally  the majority of a drug candidate s total development costs are incurred during phase  which consists of trials that are typically both the longest and largest conducted during the drug development process 
successful completion of phase clinical testing is followed by the submission of an nda to the fda for marketing approval 
it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of an nda  which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses 
following initial regulatory approval for a drug candidate  companies generally initiate additional clinical trials aimed at expanding product labeling and market potential 
the timing and costs to complete the successful development of any of our drug candidates are highly uncertain  and therefore difficult to estimate 
our research and development expenses are comprised of salaries  benefits  bonus  stock based compensation  license fees  and milestones under license agreements  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  and develop drug materials and delivery devices  and associated overhead expenses and facilities costs 
we charge direct internal and external program costs to the respective development programs 
we also incur indirect costs that are not allocated to specific programs because such costs benefit multiple development programs and allow us to increase our overall pharmaceutical development capabilities 
these consist primarily of facilities costs and other internally shared resources related to the development and maintenance of systems and processes applicable to all of our programs 
the following table sets forth information regarding our research and development expenses for our major projects for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  diabetes obesity research and early stage programs indirect costs research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with byetta and exenatide once weekly which are shared by lilly pursuant to our collaboration agreement 
cost sharing payments received by lilly are included in revenues under collaborative agreements 
increased expenditures for our diabetes development programs are generally partially offset by an increase in cost sharing payments from lilly 
cost sharing payments were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase in as compared to primarily reflects increased expenses associated with our diabetes programs 
the increase in expenses for our diabetes programs primarily reflects increased expenses for exenatide once weekly associated with manufacturing scale up at third party manufacturers and our manufacturing facility in ohio and expenses associated with the recently completed comparator study discussed above 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million increase in as compared to primarily reflects increased expenses associated with our diabetes  obesity  research and early stage programs  and indirect costs 
the increase in expenses for our diabetes programs primarily reflects costs associated with the development of exenatide once weekly  including the recently completed comparator study discussed above and manufacturing scale up for exenatide once weekly  and label expansion activities for byetta  including costs associated with the recently completed monotherapy study discussed above 
the increase in expenses for our obesity programs primarily reflects costs associated with our acquisition of the rights to leptin from amgen in early the increase in research and early stage programs primarily reflects costs associated with an increase in discovery research activities 
the increase in indirect costs primarily reflects increased facilities costs to support growth in our research and development activities 
research and development expenses are expected to continue to increase in due to increases in the level of our spending on our exenatide franchise  including exenatide once weekly  and investment in our obesity programs 
collaborative profit sharing collaborative profit sharing was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and consists of lilly s share of the gross margin for byetta sales in the united states 
make whole payment on debt redemption in july  we called for the redemption on august  of all our outstanding convertible senior notes due june  or the notes  under a provisional redemption based upon the market price of our common stock exceeding certain thresholds 
all holders elected to convert their notes into shares of our common stock 
in connection with the conversion  we issued approximately million shares  including  shares as a make whole payment  representing per  principal amount of the notes converted less interest actually paid 
in connection with this make whole payment  we recorded a non cash  non operating charge of million during the third quarter of interest and other income and expense interest and other income consists primarily of interest income from investment of cash and investments 
interest and other income was million in  million in and million in the increase in compared to primarily reflects higher average investment balances due to net proceeds of million from our notes issued in june the increase in primarily reflects higher average cash balances available for investment and higher interest rates in as compared to interest and other expense consists primarily of interest expense resulting from long term debt obligations and includes interest payments and the amortization of debt issuance costs 
interest and other expense was million in  million in and million in the increase in compared to primarily reflects an increase in additional interest expense for our notes issued in june the decrease in compared to reflects lower interest expense following the august redemption of our notes 
net loss our net loss for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in the decrease in our net loss in compared to primarily reflects increased net product sales and revenues under collaborative agreements  partially offset by increased selling  general  and administrative expenses  increased research and development expenses and increased collaborative profit sharing discussed above 
the increase in our net loss in  compared to primarily reflects the increased costs and expenses and decreased revenues under collaborative agreements  partially offset by the increases in net product sales and interest and other income discussed above 
we may incur operating losses for the next few years 
our ability to reach profitability in the future will be heavily dependent upon the product sales that we achieve for byetta and symlin 
in addition  ongoing and potential increased expenses associated with the commercialization of byetta and symlin  and expenses associated with the continuation and potential expansion of our research and development programs  and related support infrastructure may impact our ability to reach profitability in the future 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of expenses incurred and revenues recognized 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public sales and private placements of our common and preferred stock  debt financings  payments received pursuant to our byetta collaboration with lilly  reimbursement of symlin development expenses through earlier collaboration agreements  and since the second quarter of  through product sales of byetta and symlin 
at december   we had  million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  we used cash of million  million and million for our operating activities in the years ended december   and  respectively 
our cash used for operating activities in included uses of cash due to increases in accounts receivable and inventories of million and million  respectively 
the increase in accounts receivable reflects growth in our net product sales and the increase in inventories reflects increased inventory purchases to support this growth 
our cash used for operating activities in included sources of cash for increases in our current liabilities  including an increase of million in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  an increase of million in accrued compensation  and an increase of million in payable to collaborative partner 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily reflects growth in our expenses generally  and accounts payable timing differences 
the increase in accrued compensation primarily reflects an accrual of million for the contribution to the esop 
the increase in payable to collaborative partner  which represents lilly s share of byetta gross margins in the united states  reflects increased net product sales for byetta and an improvement in gross margins 
our investing activities used cash of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
investing activities in all three years consisted primarily of purchases and sales of short term investments and purchases of property  plant and equipment 
purchases of property  plant and equipment increased to million in  from million in and million in the increase in primarily reflects costs associated with our manufacturing facility for exenatide once weekly and  to a lesser extent  purchases of tenant improvements  computer software  office equipment and scientific equipment to support our growth 
we expect that our capital expenditures will continue to increase in due primarily to costs associated with ongoing construction of our manufacturing facility for exenatide once weekly 
we expect to complete the commercial scale manufacturing process in the second half of  at a total cost of approximately million  including costs associated with the construction of the facility  purchase and installation of equipment and capitalized labor and materials required to validate the facility 
through december   we had expended approximately million associated with the construction of this facility 
the full expansion of this project is dependent upon on the continued progress of exenatide once weekly through the development process 
in addition  we anticipate continued investments in tenant improvements  office equipment and scientific equipment 
the million increase in other long term assets primarily reflects our investments in psylin  bioseek and xenome 
financing activities provided cash of million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
financing activities in included million in net proceeds from our issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of our notes  the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan and proceeds of million for a contingent share settled obligation to lilly 
the contingent share settled obligation to lilly relates to the million of milestones received by us in december for which lilly is entitled to and elected to convert into shares of our common stock in february financing activities also included million of net proceeds related to a term loan provided by the credit agreement entered into in december at december   we had million in aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes due in  or the notes  and million of the notes outstanding 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of up to million shares of our common stock at approximately per share and are not redeemable at our option 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of up to million shares of our common stock at approximately per share and are not redeemable at our option 
in december  we entered into a million credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility also provides for the issuance of letters of credit and foreign exchange hedging up to the million borrowing limit 
the term loan is repayable on a quarterly basis  with no payments due quarters one through four  of the outstanding principal due quarters five through eleven  and of the outstanding principal due in quarter twelve 
at december  we had an outstanding balance of million under the term loan and had issued million of letters of credit under the revolving credit facility 
both loans have a final maturity date of december  interest on the term loan is payable quarterly in arrears at a rate equal to above the london interbank offered rate  or libor  of either one  two  three  or six months libor term at our election 
we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement which resulted in a fixed interest rate of under the term loan 
the interest rate on the credit facility is either libor plus or the bank of america prime rate  at our election 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and maturity dates as of december  in thousands 
payments due by period less contractual than after obligations total year years years years long term convertible debt interest on long term convertible debt long term note payable interest on long term note payable  net of swap transactions inventory purchase obligations operating leases total the interest payments shown were calculated using a rate of  the net rate from the term loan and interest rate swap  on the outstanding principal balance of the term loan 
includes million of outstanding purchase orders  cancelable by us upon days written notice  subject to reimbursement of costs incurred through the date of cancellation 
excludes long term obligation of million related to deferred compensation  the payment of which is subject to elections made by participants that are subject to change 
in addition  under certain license and collaboration agreements we are required to pay royalties and or milestone payments upon the successful development and commercialization of related products 
we expect to make development milestone payments up to million associated with licensing agreements in the next months 
additional milestones of up to approximately million could be paid over the next ten to fifteen years if development and commercialization of all our early stage programs continue and are successful 
the significant majority of these milestones relate to potential future regulatory approvals and subsequent sales thresholds 
given the inherent risk in pharmaceutical development  it is highly unlikely that we will ultimately make all of these milestone payments  however  we would consider these payments as positive because they would signify that the related products are moving successfully through development and commercialization 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount of product sales we achieve for byetta and symlin  costs associated with the commercialization of byetta and symlin  costs associated with the construction of our exenatide once weekly manufacturing facility  costs of potential licenses or acquisitions  the potential need to repay existing indebtedness  costs associated with an increase in our infrastructure  our ability to receive or need to make milestone payments  our ability  and the extent to which we establish collaborative arrangements for symlin or any of our product candidates  progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of these programs  costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  enforcing or defending our patents  competing technological and market developments  and costs of manufacturing  including costs associated with establishing our own manufacturing capabilities or obtaining and validating additional manufacturers of our products  and scale up costs for our drug candidates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash primarily in united states government securities  securities of agencies sponsored by the united states government  asset backed securities  mortgage backed securities and debt instruments of financial institutions and corporations with strong credit ratings 
these instruments have various short term maturities  and therefore the risk of loss due to interest rate risk is considered to be low 
we do not invest in auction rate securities 
we mitigate certain financial exposures  including currency risk and interest rate risk  through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments  however we do not utilize such instruments in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the instruments held are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive investments 
our debt is not subject to significant swings in valuation as interest rates on a majority of our debt are fixed 
the fair value of our notes and notes at december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates
