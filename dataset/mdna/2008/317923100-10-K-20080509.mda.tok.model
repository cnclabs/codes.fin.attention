also during fiscal  the board of directors of the company approved management s recommendation to proceed with the closure of the company s paiva stores

management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
costs of sales 
costs of sales include the cost associated with acquiring merchandise from vendors  occupancy costs  provision for inventory shortages  and credits and allowances from our merchandise vendors following emerging issues task force eitf accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf guidance 
because the company does not include the costs associated with operating its distribution facility and freight within cost of sales  the company s gross profit may not be comparable to those of other retailers that may include all costs related to their distribution facilities in costs of sales and in the calculation of gross profit 
selling  general  and administrative expenses

the company s valuation of inventory includes markdown adjustments for merchandise that will be sold below cost and the impact of shrinkage 
markdowns are based upon historical information and assumptions about future demand and market conditions

vendor allowances 
the company records vendor allowances and discounts in the consolidated statements of operations when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled 
allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and  accordingly  are reflected as reductions to cost of merchandise sold as negotiated 
vendors participation in the reduction of the selling price of merchandise fluctuates based on the amount of promotional and clearance markdowns necessary to liquidate the inventory 
vendor allowances received for advertising or fixture programs reduce the company s expense or expenditure for the related advertising or fixture program 

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impairment of long lived assets 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which generally requires the company to assess these assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
the company considers historical performance and future estimated results in its evaluation of potential impairment and then compares the carrying amount of the asset to the estimated non discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by comparing projected individual store discounted cash flows to the asset carrying values 
the estimation of fair value is measured by discounting expected future cash flows at the discount rate the company utilizes to evaluate potential investments 
actual results may differ from these estimates and as a result the estimation of fair values may be adjusted in the future 
the company is required to perform an impairment review of its goodwill if impairment indicators arise and  at a minimum  annually 
the company has chosen to perform this review at the end of january each fiscal year  and it is done in a two step approach 
the initial step requires that the carrying value be compared with its estimated fair value 
the second step  to evaluate goodwill for impairment  is only required if the carrying value of that reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair value is determined based on estimated future discounted cash flows 
the company evaluates its other intangible assets  specifically tradenames  for impairment on an annual basis by comparing the fair value of the asset with its carrying value 
such estimates are subject to change and the company may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
operating leases 
the company leases retail stores under operating leases 
many lease agreements contain rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
the company recognizes rent expense for minimum lease payments on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
the company uses a time period for its straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation 
in addition  the commencement date of the lease term is the earlier of the date when the company becomes legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when the company takes possession of the leased space for buildout 
contingent rents are determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels 
the company records a contingent rent liability in other liabilities and accrued expenses on the consolidated balance sheets and the corresponding rent expense when specified levels have been achieved or when management determines that achieving the specified levels during the fiscal year is probable 
share based compensation expense 
effective february   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment fas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  share based compensation expense recognized during fiscal and for share based awards includes a compensation expense for all share based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  february   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation fas  and b compensation expense for all share based compensation awards granted subsequent to february   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  results for the prior period have not been restated 
prior to the adoption of fas r  the company recognized share based compensation expense in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  as permitted by fas the calculation of share based compensation expense involves estimates that require management s judgments 
these estimates include the fair value of each of the stock option awards granted  which is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
there are two significant inputs into the black scholes option pricing model expected volatility and expected term 
the company estimates expected volatility 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued based on the historical volatility of the company s stock over a term equal to the expected term of the option granted 
the expected term of stock option awards granted is derived from historical exercise experience under the company s stock option plans and represents the period of time that stock option awards granted are expected to be outstanding 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and the company uses different assumptions  share based compensation expense could be different in the future 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if the company s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate  the share based compensation expense could be different from what the company has recorded
