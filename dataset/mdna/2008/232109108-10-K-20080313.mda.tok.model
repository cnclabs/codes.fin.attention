we are a global medical device company engaged in the design  development  manufacture  marketing and servicing of laser and other light based aesthetics systems for practitioners worldwide 
we offer easy to use products on three platforms coolglide  xeo and solera which enable physicians and other qualified practitioners to offer safe and effective aesthetic treatments to their customers 
our corporate headquarters and us operations are located in brisbane  california  where we conduct our manufacturing  warehousing  research  regulatory  sales  service marketing and administrative activities 
in the united states  we market  sell and service our products primarily through a direct sales force of employees as of december  and through a distribution relationship with pss world medical shared services  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of pss world medical  or pss  which has over sales professionals serving physician offices throughout the united states 
in addition  we also sell certain items  like titan hand piece refills and marketing brochures  via the web 
international sales are generally made through a direct sales force of employees and through a worldwide distributor network in approximately countries as of december  outside the united states  we have a direct sales presence in australia  canada  france  japan  spain  switzerland and the united kingdom 

table of contents products 
our revenue is derived from the sale of products  product upgrades  service  and titan hand piece refills 
product revenue represents the sale of a system  which consists of one or more hand pieces and a console that incorporates a universal graphic user interface  a laser and or other light based module  control system software and high voltage electronics 
however  depending on the application  the laser or other light based module is sometimes instead contained in the hand piece 
we offer our customers the ability to select the system that best fits their practice at the time of purchase and then to cost effectively add applications to their system as their practice grows 
this enables customers to upgrade their systems whenever they want and provides us with a source of recurring revenue  which we classify as product upgrade revenue 
service revenue relates to amortization of pre paid maintenance and support contract revenue and receipts for services on out of warranty products 
titan hand piece refill revenue is associated with our titan hand piece  which requires a periodic refilling process  which includes the replacement of the optical source after a set number of pulses have been used 
significant business trends 
we believe that revenue growth has been  and will continue to be  primarily attributable to the following investments made in our global sales and marketing infrastructure  including the expansion of our sales force to increase our market penetration in the aesthetic laser market 
continuing introduction of new aesthetic products and applications 
marketing to physicians outside the core dermatology and plastic surgeon specialties 
generating service  upgrade and titan hand piece refill revenue from our growing installed base of customers 
in  compared to  our us revenue declined and our international revenue grew 
in contrast  in  compared to  our us revenue grew  while our international revenue grew 
the weaker us revenue growth from to  as compared from to  was primarily attributable to lower sales productivity of our recently hired north american sales professionals and to slower than expected adoption of our new pearl product by new customers 
also  some of our public competitors have reported reduced growth rates for the second half of the year ended december   which may indicate signs of a slowing market growth rate that could have contributed to a decrease in our us revenue growth rate 
the stronger international revenue growth in  compared to us revenue growth for that same period  was primarily attributable to continuing investments in building our international sales distribution channels 
these efforts have resulted in increased revenue from several of our geographic locations  with growth primarily sourced from australia  japan  many european countries and latin america 
as a result of this stronger international revenue growth  international revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to in  compared with in for  our gross margin declined to  compared to in this decrease was primarily attributable to lower introductory margins for our pearl enabled systems and upgrades that started shipping in june  reduced leverage of our manufacturing and service expenses due to lower than expected revenue  and  of higher patent royalty expense 
since the patent license was signed in the second quarter of  royalty expenses were incurred for sales made during the last three quarters of  and for all four quarters of sales and marketing expenses for  compared to  increased by million  or  due primarily to expenses associated with the expansion of our worldwide sales force and management team 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to in  compared to in  due primarily to lower sales productivity from the recently expanded north american sales team 
research and development expenses for  compared with  increased by  or  due primarily to increased expenses related to the development  testing and clinical research of our pearl product  which started shipping in june as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses increased to in  compared to in 
table of contents general and administrative expenses for  compared with  decreased by million  or  to million and were of net revenue 
this decrease was primarily attributable to the following expenses incurred in but not in million of legal expenses related to the patent litigation matter settled in the second quarter ended june  and a charge of approximately  relating to a liability for sales taxes in certain jurisdictions that we had determined we did not have a taxable presence 
in april and may  two securities class action lawsuits were filed against us and were later consolidated into one lawsuit 
in we incurred approximately  in legal fees to defend this class action lawsuit 
however  given that we retain director and officer liability insurance with a deductible  this litigation is not expected to have a material impact on our expenses in in january  a tcpa class action lawsuit was filed against us 
for additional details relating to these lawsuits see part i  item legal proceedings 
factors that may impact future performance our industry is impacted by numerous competitive  regulatory and other significant factors 
our industry is highly competitive and our future performance depends on our ability to compete successfully 
additionally  the growth of our business relies on our ability to continue to develop new products and innovative technologies  obtain regulatory clearances for our products  protect the proprietary technology of our products and our manufacturing processes  manufacture our products cost effectively  and successfully market and distribute our products in a profitable manner 
if we fail to compete effectively  continue to develop new products and technologies  obtain regulatory clearances  protect our intellectual property  manufacture our products cost effectively  or market and distribute our products in a profitable manner  our business could suffer 
a detailed discussion of these and other factors that could impact our future performance are provided in part i  item a risk factors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we periodically review our accounting policies and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
in addition to the accounting policies that are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we consider the critical accounting policies described below to be affected by critical accounting estimates 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
our critical accounting policies that are affected by accounting estimates are as follows cash equivalents and marketable securities we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
we consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
at december   all other investment securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within stockholders equity 
management assesses whether declines in the fair value of investment securities are other than temporary 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
in determining whether a decline is other than temporary  management considers the following factors length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and 
table of contents our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
to date we have had no declines in fair value that have been identified as other than temporary 
stock based compensation expense we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas r  share based payment revised 
sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including stock options  employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan and restricted stock unit awards 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  and reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for periods prior to have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
share based compensation expense recognized is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest 
share based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and included compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  december  based on the fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  and compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  based on the fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  we estimated the fair value of each stock option on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model and elected to attribute the value of share based compensation to expense using the straight line method  which was previously used for our pro forma information required under sfas no 
given the black scholes option valuation model requires the use of subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility  expected term of stock option  risk free interest rate and forfeiture rates  if any of the assumptions used change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
prior to the adoption of sfas r with effect from january   we accounted for stock based employee compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and its interpretations and complied with the disclosure provisions of sfas as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
under apb opinion no 
 compensation expense is based on the difference  if any  on the date of the grant between the fair market value of our stock and the exercise price 
employee stock based compensation is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying options 
revenue recognition we recognize distributor and non distributor revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
sab no 
requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determination of whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and whether delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered  and the collectability of those fees 
in instances where final 
table of contents acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or collectability has not been reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
revenue under service contracts is recognized on a straight line basis over the period of the applicable service contract 
service revenue  not under a service contract  is recognized as the services are provided 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market  computed on a standard cost basis  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis and market being determined as the lower of replacement cost or net realizable value 
standard costs are monitored and updated quarterly or as necessary  to reflect changes in raw material costs  labor to manufacture the product and overhead rates 
we provide for excess and obsolete inventories when conditions indicate that the selling price could be less than cost due to physical deterioration  usage  obsolescence  reductions in estimated future demand and reductions in selling prices 
inventory provisions are measured as the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value and charged to cost of revenue to establish a lower cost basis for the inventories 
we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels with the risk of obsolescence due to changing technology and customer demand levels 
unfavorable changes in market conditions may result in a need for additional inventory provisions that could adversely impact our gross margins 
conversely  favorable changes in demand could result in higher gross margins when product that has previously been reserved is sold 
warranty obligations we provide a standard one year or two year warranty coverage on our systems 
warranty coverage provided is for labor and parts necessary to repair the systems during the warranty period 
we provide for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in cost of revenue when the related revenue is recognized 
the accrued warranty costs represent our best estimate at the time of sale  and as reviewed and updated quarterly  of the total costs that we expect to incur in repairing or replacing product parts that fail while still under warranty 
accrued warranty costs include costs of material  technical support labor and associated overhead 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs obligation for established products is primarily based on historical experience as to product failures adjusted for current information on repair costs 
for new products  estimates will include historical experience of similar products  as well as reasonable allowance for start up expenses 
actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances of our warranty obligations and update the historical warranty cost trends 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future due to actual product failure rates  material usage  service delivery costs or overhead costs differing from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which would negatively impact our operating results 
provision for income taxes we are subject to taxes on earnings in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
as a global taxpayer  significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes on earnings 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
although we believe we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different 
we adjust these reserves 
table of contents in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or the refinement of an estimate 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate  as well as the related net interest 
our effective tax rates have differed from the statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of tax exempt interest income  foreign operations  research and development tax credits  state taxes  and certain benefits realized related to stock option activity 
our current effective tax rate does not assume us taxes on undistributed profits of foreign subsidiaries 
these earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or us federal and state taxes  should they either be deemed or actually remitted to the united states 
the effective tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for  given that the litigation settlement expense of million resulted in a significantly lower level of income before income taxes  the impact of deductible permanent items including  tax exempt interest income  r d tax credits and deductions for disqualifying incentive stock option exercises  resulted in a substantially more pronounced impact on our effective income tax rate  as they represented a larger percentage of our income before income taxes 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and being higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  or by changes in tax laws including whether the us congress ratifies the federal r d tax credit for regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
contingencies we have been  and may in the future become  subject to legal proceedings related to securities litigation  intellectual property and other operational matters such as the tcpa infringement matter described in item legal proceedings 
based on the information available at the balance sheet dates and through consultation with our legal counsel  we assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes for these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable loss 
if losses are probable and reasonably estimable  we will record a reserve in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies 
currently we have no such reserves recorded 
any reserves recorded in the future may change due to new developments in each matter 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas is effective for us beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas sfas permits companies to choose to measure certain financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the standard requires that unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected be reported in earnings 
sfas is effective for us beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact that sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  or sfas r 
this issuance retains the fundamental requirements in sfas that the acquisition method of accounting which sfas called the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
sfas r defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control 
sfas r is effective for us beginning january  though this pronouncement is not expected to have an effect on our consolidated financial position  annual results of operations or cash flows  if we were to acquire another entity  we would be required to account for it in accordance with this pronouncement 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  sfas 
this issuance amends accounting research bulletin to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
sfas is effective for us beginning january  though this pronouncement is not expected to have an effect on our consolidated financial position  annual results of operations or cash flows  if we were to acquire another entity  we would be required to account for it in accordance with this pronouncement

table of contents adequacy of cash resources to meet future needs we had cash and marketable investments of million as of december  of this amount  we had million invested in auction rate securities that were rated aaa or better by a major credit rating agency and are either commercially insured or guaranteed by the federal family education loan program ffelp 
as of december   of the million of auction rate securities  the company classified million under the caption of marketable investments long term portion in the consolidated balance sheet 
as of february  we had million of our investment portfolio invested in auction rate securities 
these auction rate securities provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  generally every days though auctions for some of the securities are held every days 
during the period from january  to february   auctions for million of our investments in auction rate securities failed due to the current overall credit concerns in capital markets 
upon an auction failure  the interest rates do not reset at a market rate but instead reset based on a formula contained in the security prospectus  which rate is generally higher than the current market rate 
the failure of the auctions impacts our ability to readily liquidate our auction rate securities into cash until a future auction of these investments is successful or the auction rate security is refinanced by the issuer into another type of debt instrument 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to operate our business as usual 
contractual cash obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  for minimum lease payments related to facility leases 
payments due by period s contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating leases off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  variable interest or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any unconsolidated transactions 
income tax liability as a result of the adoption of fin  as of december   we have included in our condensed consolidated balance sheet  in accrued liabilities and million in long term income tax liability with respect to unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest 
at this time  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of payments in individual years beyond months due to uncertainties in the timing of tax audit outcomes 
as a result  this amount is not included in the contractual obligations table above 
indemnifications in the normal course of business  we enter into agreements that contain a variety of representations  warranties  and indemnification obligations 
for example  we have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers 
in  two of our executive officers were named as defendants in securities class action litigation see part i  item legal proceedings 
our exposure under the various indemnification 
table of contents obligations  including those under the indemnification agreements with our directors and executive officers  is unknown since the outcome of the securities litigation is unpredictable and the amount that could be payable thereunder is not reasonably estimable  and since other indemnification obligations involve future claims that may be made against us 
we have not accrued or paid any amounts for any such indemnification obligations 
however  we may record charges in the future as a result of these potential indemnification obligations  including those related to the securities class action litigation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments including variable rate demand notes  auction rate securities and bonds of the us government  its agencies  and municipalities  and high quality corporate issuers 
by policy  we restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we maintain investments at a weighted average maturity interest reset date for auction rate securities and variable rate demand notes of generally less than eighteen months 
for maturities of our marketable investments  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value of our total investment portfolio as of december  would have potentially declined by while we transact business primarily in us dollars  and a significant proportion of our revenue is denominated in us dollars  a portion of our revenue and operating expenses are denominated in other currencies  such as the euro  japanese yen  australian dollar  canadian dollar and british pound sterling 
though our exposure to exchange rate volatility has not been significant to date  future fluctuations in the value of the us dollar may affect the price competitiveness of our products and or adversely impact our gross margins and operating margins 
we do not believe  however  that we currently have significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk and have not hedged exposures denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion
