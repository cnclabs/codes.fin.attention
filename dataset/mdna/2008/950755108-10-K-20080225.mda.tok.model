overview we operate in the truckload sector of the trucking industry  with a focus on transporting consumer nondurable products that ship more consistently throughout the year 
our success depends on our ability to efficiently manage our resources in the delivery of truckload transportation and logistics services to our customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand  which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
our ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is essential to efficiently deploy resources and make capital investments in tractors and trailers with respect to our truckload segment or obtain qualified third party capacity at a reasonable price with respect to our vas segment 
although our business volume is not highly concentrated  we may also be occasionally affected by our customers financial failures or loss of customer business 
operating revenues consist of i trucking revenues generated by the six operating fleets in the truckload segment dedicated  medium to long haul van  regional short haul  expedited  temperature controlled and flatbed and ii non trucking revenues generated primarily by our vas segment 
our truckload segment also includes a small amount of non trucking revenues  consisting primarily of the portion of shipments delivered to or from mexico where the truckload segment utilizes a third party capacity provider 
non trucking revenues reported in the operating statistics table include those revenues generated by the vas and truckload segments 
trucking revenues accounted for of total operating revenues in  and non trucking and other operating revenues accounted for 
trucking services typically generate revenues on a per mile basis 
other sources of trucking revenues include fuel surcharges and accessorial revenues such as stop charges  loading unloading charges and equipment detention charges 
because fuel surcharge revenues fluctuate in response to changes in fuel costs  these revenues are identified separately within the operating statistics table and are excluded from the statistics to provide a more meaningful comparison between periods 
the non trucking revenues in the operating statistics table include such revenues generated by a fleet whose operations fall within the truckload segment 
we do this so that we can calculate the revenue statistics in the operating statistics table using only the revenue generated by company owned and owner operator trucks 
the key statistics used to evaluate trucking revenues excluding fuel surcharges are i average revenues per tractor per week  ii per mile rates charged to customers  iii average monthly miles generated per tractor  iv average percentage of empty miles miles without trailer cargo  v average trip length and vi average number of tractors in service 
general economic conditions  seasonal freight patterns in the trucking industry and industry capacity are important factors that impact these statistics 
our most significant resource requirements are company drivers  owner operators  tractors  trailers and equipment operating costs such as fuel and related fuel taxes  driver pay  insurance and supplies and maintenance 
we have historically been successful mitigating our risk to fuel price increases by recovering additional fuel surcharges from our customers that recoup a majority of the increased fuel costs  however  we cannot assure that current recovery levels will continue in future periods 
our financial results are also affected by company driver and owner operator availability and the market for new and used revenue equipment 
we are self insured for a significant portion of bodily injury  property damage and cargo claims and for workers compensation benefits for our employees supplemented by premium based coverage above certain dollar levels 
for that reason  our financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  weather  legal and regulatory environments and insurance coverage costs to protect against catastrophic losses 
the operating ratio is a common industry measure used to evaluate our profitability and that of our trucking operating fleets 
the operating ratio consists of operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
the most significant variable expenses that impact trucking operations are driver salaries and benefits  payments to owner operators included in rent and purchased transportation expense  fuel  fuel taxes included in taxes and licenses expense  supplies and maintenance and insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary based on the number of miles generated 
as such  we also evaluate these costs on a per mile basis to adjust for the impact on the percentage of total operating revenues caused by changes in fuel surcharge revenues  per mile rates charged to customers and non trucking revenues 
as discussed further in the comparison of operating results for to  several industry wide issues could cause costs to increase in these issues include a softer freight market and fluctuating fuel prices 
our main fixed costs include depreciation expense for tractors and trailers and equipment licensing fees included in taxes and licenses expense 
depreciation expense was historically affected by the epa engine emission standards that became effective in october and applied to all new trucks purchased after that time  resulting in increased truck purchase costs 
depreciation expense will also be affected in the future because in january a second set of more strict epa engine emissions standards became effective for all newly manufactured truck engines 
compared to trucks with engines produced before  the trucks with new engines manufactured under the standards have higher purchase prices  and we expect them to be less fuel efficient and result in increased maintenance costs 
the trucking operations require substantial cash expenditures for tractor and trailer purchases 
in and  we accelerated our normal three year replacement cycle for company owned tractors 
we funded these purchases with net cash from operations and financing available under our existing credit facilities  as management deemed necessary 
the additional number of new trucks purchased in and has allowed us to delay purchases of trucks with the new standard engines until the weak freight market is placing increasing pressure on rates during first quarter costs for the truckload segment were much higher in january compared to january due to i significantly higher fuel prices  ii much higher maintenance due in part to worse than normal winter weather and iii higher insurance 
based on january results  it is likely that our earnings per share for first quarter will be significantly lower than our earnings per share for first quarter we provide non trucking services primarily through our vas division 
these services include truck brokerage  freight management single source logistics  intermodal and international 
unlike our trucking operations  the non trucking operations are less asset intensive and are instead dependent upon qualified employees  information systems and qualified third party capacity providers 
the most significant expense item related to these non trucking services is the cost of transportation we pay to third party capacity providers 
this expense item is recorded as rent and purchased transportation expense 
other expenses include salaries  wages and benefits and computer hardware and software depreciation 
we evaluate our non trucking operations by reviewing the gross margin percentage revenues less rent and purchased transportation expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues and the operating income percentage 
the operating income percentage for the non trucking business is lower than those of the trucking operations  but the return on assets is substantially higher

higher fuel prices and higher fuel surcharge collections increase our consolidated operating ratio and the truckload segment s operating ratio when fuel surcharges are reported on a gross basis as revenues versus netting against fuel expenses 
eliminating fuel surcharge revenues  which are generally a more volatile source of revenue  provides a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period

compared to operating revenues operating revenues decreased in compared to excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in the average number of tractors in service as discussed further below  offset partially by a increase in average annual miles per tractor 
the truckload freight market was softer during most of compared to additionally  the significant industry wide accelerated purchase of new trucks in advance of the new epa engine emissions standards contributed to excess truck capacity that partially disrupted the supply and demand balance during these combined factors negatively affected revenues per total mile  which decreased in compared to freight demand softness and the temporary increase in the supply of trucks caused by the industry truck pre buy made for challenging freight market conditions during in mid march  we began reducing our medium to long haul van fleet by a total of trucks to better match the volume of freight with the capacity of trucks and to improve profitability 
this fleet has the greatest exposure to the spot freight market and faced the most operational and competitive challenges 
by the latter part of april  this initial medium to long haul van fleet reduction goal was achieved  but we had not yet achieved the desired balance of trucks and freight 
as a result  we decided to further reduce our medium to long haul van fleet by an additional trucks  which we completed by the end of june we were able to transfer a portion of our medium to long haul van fleet trucks to other more profitable fleets 
the net impact to our total fleet was an approximate truck reduction from mid march to the end of june beginning in the second week of november  we reduced our medium to long haul van fleet by an additional trucks due to further weakness in the van market 
this resulted in a cumulative truck reduction of our medium to long haul van fleet from mid march to december after experiencing disappointing load counts during the first three weeks of january  we reduced our medium to long haul van fleet by another trucks in order to achieve the operational efficiencies and profitability expectations for this fleet 
load volumes were lower for the medium to long haul van fleet during the first eight weeks of compared to the same period of prebook percentages of loads to trucks for the medium to long haul van fleet were lower in january compared to january after the truck medium to long haul van fleet reduction in january  prebook percentages of loads to trucks in the first three weeks of february were still lower than the first three weeks of february the average percentage of empty miles increased to in from in this increase resulted from the weaker freight market  a higher percentage of dedicated trucks in the total fleet and more regional shipments with shorter lengths of haul 
over the past few years  we have grown our dedicated fleets 
these fleets generally operate according to arrangements under which we provide trucks and or trailers for a specific customer s exclusive use 
under nearly all of these arrangements  dedicated customers pay us on an all mile basis regardless of whether trailers or trucks are loaded or empty to obtain guaranteed truck and or trailer capacity 
for freight management and statistical reporting purposes  we classify a mile without cargo in the trailer as an empty mile or deadhead mile 
the growth of our dedicated fleet business and the higher percentage of miles without cargo in the trailer attributed to dedicated fleets have each contributed to an increase in our reported average empty miles percentage 
if we excluded the dedicated fleet  the average empty mile percentage would be in and in fuel surcharge revenues represent collections from customers for the higher cost of fuel 
these revenues increased to million in from million in in response to higher average fuel prices in to lessen the effect of fluctuating fuel prices on our margins  we collect fuel surcharge revenues from our customers 
our fuel surcharge programs are designed to i recoup high fuel costs from customers when fuel prices rise and ii provide customers with the benefit of lower costs when fuel prices decline 
the company s fuel surcharge standard is a one cent per mile rate increase for every five cent per gallon increase in the doe weekly retail on highway diesel prices 
this standard is used for many fuel surcharge programs 
these programs have historically enabled us to recover approximately of the fuel price increases 
the remaining is generally not recoverable because of empty miles not billable to customers  out of route miles  truck idle time and the volatility of fuel prices when prices change rapidly in short time periods 
also  in a rapidly rising fuel price market  there is generally a several week delay between the payment of higher fuel prices and surcharge recovery 
in a rapidly declining fuel price market  the opposite generally occurs  and there is a temporary higher surcharge recovery compared to the price paid for fuel 
vas revenues decreased to million in from million in due to a customer structural change discussed below  offset partially by an increase in brokerage and international revenues 
vas gross margin dollars increased for the same period due to an improvement in the gross margin percentage in the brokerage and intermodal divisions 
vas revenues are generated by the following vas operating divisions brokerage  freight management single source logistics  intermodal and international 
beginning in third quarter  we negotiated with a large vas customer a structural change to their continuing arrangement related to the use of third party carriers 
this change affects the reporting of vas revenues and purchased transportation expenses for this customer in third quarter and future periods  and consequently  we began reporting vas revenues for this customer on a net basis revenues net of purchased transportation expense rather than on a gross basis 
this reporting change resulted in a reduction in vas revenues and vas rent and purchased transportation expense of million comparing the second half of to the second half of this reporting change had no impact on the dollar amount of vas gross margin or operating income 
excluding the affected freight revenues for this customer  vas revenues grew in compared to brokerage continued to produce strong results with revenue growth and improved operating income as a percentage of revenues 
freight management successfully distributed freight to other operating divisions and continues to secure new customer business awards that generate additional freight opportunities across all company business units 
intermodal revenues declined by design  yet produced significant operating income improvement as we benefited from intermodal strategy changes that management began implementing during the latter part of werner global logistics wgl  formed in july  is actively assisting customers with innovative global supply chain solutions 
customer development efforts are progressing  and wgl continues to secure several new and meaningful customer business awards

owner operator costs are included in rent and purchased transportation expense 
owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles were in compared to in owner operators are independent contractors who supply their own tractor and driver and are responsible for their operating expenses including driver pay  fuel  supplies and maintenance and fuel taxes 
this increase in owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles shifted costs to the rent and purchased transportation category from other expense categories 
we estimate that rent and purchased transportation expense for the truckload segment was higher by approximately cents per total mile due to this increase  and other expense categories had offsetting decreases on a total mile basis as follows i salaries  wages and benefits  cents  ii fuel  cents  iii taxes and licenses  cent  and iv depreciation  cent 
salaries  wages and benefits for non drivers increased in compared to due to a larger number of employees required to support the growth in the non trucking vas segment 
non driver salaries for the truckload segment were flat in compared to the increase in salaries  wages and benefits per mile of cents for the truckload segment is primarily attributed to i an increase in student driver pay as the average number of student trainer teams was higher in than in  ii an increase in the dedicated fleet truck percentage as dedicated drivers typically earn a higher rate per mile than drivers in our other truck fleets  and iii higher group health insurance costs 
these cost increases for the truckload segment were partially offset by a decrease in workers compensation expense  lower state unemployment tax expense and a decrease in equipment maintenance personnel 
the driver recruiting and retention market remains challenging  but was less difficult in than in the due to improved driver availability 
the weakness in the housing market and the medium to long haul van fleet reduction contributed favorably to our driver recruiting and retention efforts 
we anticipate that competition for qualified drivers will remain high and cannot predict whether we will experience future shortages 
if such a shortage did occur and additional driver pay rate increases were necessary to attract and retain drivers  our results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that corresponding freight rate increases were not obtained 
fuel increased cents per mile for the truckload segment due primarily to higher average diesel fuel prices 
average fuel prices in were cents per gallon  or  higher than in for the first eight months of  average fuel prices were nearly the same as they were during the first eight months of however  during the last four months of  average fuel prices continued to increase to record levels  while prices declined in the last four months of fuel prices averaged cents more per gallon in the last four months of versus the same period in higher net fuel costs had a cent negative impact on earnings per share in compared to fuel prices have remained high to date in as of today  diesel fuel prices are cents per gallon higher than on the same date a year ago  and average prices to date in are cents per gallon higher than in the same period of we include all of the following items when calculating fuel s impact on earnings for both periods i average fuel price per gallon  ii fuel reimbursements paid to owner operator drivers  iii miles per gallon and iv offsetting fuel surcharge revenues from customers 
during third quarter  truckload carriers transitioned a gradually increasing portion of their diesel fuel consumption from low sulfur diesel fuel to ulsd fuel 
this transition occurred because fuel refiners were required to meet the epa mandated ulsd threshold by october  preliminary estimates indicated that ulsd would result in a degradation in mpg for all trucks due to the lower energy content btu of ulsd 
since the transition occurred  the result is an approximate degradation of mpg 
we believe that other factors which impact mpg  including increasing the percentage of aerodynamic trucks in our company truck fleet  have offset the negative mpg impact of ulsd 
we have historically been successful recouping approximately of fuel cost increases through our fuel surcharge program 
the remaining difference is caused by the impact of operational costs such as truck idling  empty miles  out of route miles  and the government mandated conversion to ulsd 
in the past  we met with our customers to obtain recovery for this shortfall in base rates per mile 
however  because of the current softer freight market  we have been unable to recover this shortfall in base rates 
as a result  increases in the cost of fuel are expected to continue impacting our earnings per share until freight market conditions may allow us to recover this shortfall from customers 
we are continuing to take actions to aggressively manage the controllable aspects of our fuel costs 
shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices and petroleum product rationing can have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
we are unable to predict whether fuel price levels will increase or decrease in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges will be collected from customers 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
supplies and maintenance for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in compared to higher over the road tractor repairs and maintenance were the primary cause of this increase because the increased percentage of dedicated fleet trucks requires more repairs to be performed off site rather than at our terminals 
in addition  the average age of our company owned truck fleet increased to years at december  compared to years at december  a portion of this increase was offset by lower non driver salaries  wages and benefits from a decrease in maintenance personnel  as previously noted 
our trailer repair costs were slightly lower in than in because our ongoing purchases of new van trailers lowered the average age of our trailer fleet 
insurance and claims for the truckload segment did not change significantly from to  increasing just cents on a per mile basis 
we renewed our liability insurance policies on august  and became responsible for an annual million aggregate for claims between million and million 
during the policy year that ended july   we were responsible for a lower million aggregate for claims between million and million and no aggregate meaning that we were fully insured for claims between million and million 
see item legal proceedings for information on our bodily injury and property damage coverage levels since august  our liability insurance premiums for the policy year beginning august  are slightly lower than the previous policy year 
rent and purchased transportation expense consists mainly of payments to third party capacity providers in the vas segment and other non trucking operations and payments to owner operators in the truckload segment 
as discussed on page  the vas segment s rent and purchased transportation expense decreased in response to a structural change to a large vas customer s continuing arrangement 
that change resulted in a reduction in vas revenues and vas rent and purchased transportation expense of i million from third quarter to third quarter and ii million from fourth quarter to fourth quarter excluding the rent and purchased transportation expense for this customer  the dollar amount of this expense increased for the vas segment  similar to vas revenues 
these expenses generally vary depending on changes in the volume of services generated by the segment 
as a percentage of vas revenues  vas rent and purchased transportation expense decreased to in compared to in rent and purchased transportation for the truckload segment increased cent per total mile in due primarily to the increase in the percentage of owner operator truck miles versus company truck miles 
increased fuel prices also necessitated higher reimbursements to owner operators for fuel million in compared to million in 
these reimbursements resulted in an increase of cents per total mile 
our customer fuel surcharge programs do not differentiate between miles generated by company owned and owner operator trucks 
rather  we include the increase in owner operator fuel reimbursements with our fuel expenses in calculating the per share impact of higher fuel costs on earnings 
challenging operating conditions continue to make owner operator recruitment and retention difficult for us 
such conditions include inflationary cost increases that are the responsibility of owner operators 
we have historically been able to add company owned tractors and recruit additional company drivers to offset any owner operator decreases 
if a shortage of owner operators and company drivers occurs  increases in per mile settlement rates for owner operators and driver pay rates for company drivers may become necessary to attract and retain these drivers 
this could negatively affect our results of operations to the extent that we did not obtain corresponding freight rate increases 
other operating expenses for the truckload segment decreased cents per mile in gains on sales of assets primarily trucks and trailers are reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses and are reported net of sales related expenses  including costs to prepare the equipment for sale 
gains on sales of assets decreased to million in from million in due to the softer freight market and higher fuel prices  fleet truck sales demand softened in fourth quarter we expect this to continue for at least the first half of  which will likely have a continued negative impact on the amount of our gains on sales 
we continued to sell our oldest van trailers that are fully depreciated and replaced them with new trailers  and we expect to continue doing so in our wholly owned used truck retail network  fleet truck sales  is one of the largest class truck sales entities in the united states 
fleet truck sales continues to be our resource for remarketing our used trucks 
other operating expenses also include bad debt expense 
in  we recorded an additional million related to the bankruptcy of one of our former customers 
we recorded million of interest expense in versus million of interest expense in because our average debt levels were higher in we had no debt outstanding at december  our interest income decreased to million in from million in our effective income tax rate income taxes expressed as a percentage of income before income taxes was for versus for  as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
during fourth quarter  we reached a tentative settlement agreement with an internal revenue service appeals officer regarding a significant timing difference between financial reporting and tax reporting for our to federal income tax returns 
we accrued the estimated cumulative interest charges  net of income taxes  of million for the anticipated settlement of this matter 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties directly related to income taxes as additional income tax expense 
compared to operating revenues operating revenues increased in compared to excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues increased due primarily to a increase in average revenues per total mile  excluding fuel surcharges  offset by a decrease in average annual miles per tractor 
the truckload freight market was sluggish during much of  particularly from mid august through december when the normal freight volume peak seasonal increase did not occur 
additionally  the significant industry wide accelerated purchase of new trucks in advance of the new engine emissions standards contributed to excess truck capacity that partially disrupted the supply and demand balance in the second half of these combined factors resulted in the decrease in annual miles per tractor and also negatively affected revenues per total mile 
while revenues per total mile increased year over year  the percentage increase over the comparable periods was lower in the last two quarters of than in the first two quarters of most of the revenues per total mile increase is due to base rate increases negotiated with customers  offset by an increase in the empty mile percentage 
a substantial portion of our freight base is under contract with customers and provides for annual pricing increases  with much of our non dedicated contractual business renewing in the latter part of third quarter and fourth quarter 
the challenging freight market in the second half of made it much more difficult for us to obtain base rate increases at levels comparable to the and renewal periods 
the average percentage of empty miles increased to in from in this increase partially resulted from higher percentages of dedicated trucks in the fleet and regional shipments with a shorter length of haul 
if we excluded the dedicated fleet  the average empty mile percentage would be in and in fuel surcharge revenues increased to million in from million in in response to higher average fuel prices in vas revenues increased to million in from million in  and gross margin increased for the same period 
most of the revenue growth came from our brokerage and intermodal divisions within vas 
operating expenses our operating ratio was in versus in expense items that impacted the overall operating ratio are described on the following pages 
as explained on page  the operating ratio increased due to the significant rise in fuel expense and recording the related fuel surcharge revenues on a gross basis

the driver recruiting and retention market remained challenging during we had two quarters of sequential decreases in the average number of tractors in service during the first half of following these decreases  our ongoing focus to lower driver turnover yielded positive results in the second half of the year

insurance and claims for the truckload segment increased cents on a per mile basis 
this increase was primarily related to higher negative development on existing liability insurance claims and an increase in larger claims 
we renewed our liability insurance policies on august  see item legal proceedings for information on our bodily injury and property damage coverage levels since august  our liability insurance premiums for the policy year beginning august  were slightly higher than the previous policy year 
depreciation expense for the truckload segment increased cents on a per mile basis in this increase is mainly due to i higher costs of new tractors having post october engines  ii the impact of fewer average miles per truck and iii an increased percentage of company owned trucks compared to owner operators 
as of december   nearly of the company owned truck fleet consisted of trucks having post october engines  compared to at december  rent and purchased transportation consists mainly of payments to third party capacity providers in the vas and other non trucking operations and payments to owner operators in the trucking operations 
rent and purchased transportation expense for the vas segment increased in response to higher vas revenues 
these expenses generally vary depending on changes in the volume of services generated by the segment 
as a percentage of vas revenues  vas rent and purchased transportation expense increased to in compared to in intermodal s gross profits and operating income declined because of the softer freight market and the influence of higher fixed costs and repositioning costs 
rent and purchased transportation for the truckload segment increased cent per total mile in higher fuel prices necessitated higher reimbursements to owner operators for fuel million in compared to million in 
these higher owner operator reimbursements resulted in an increase of cents per total mile 
we also increased the van and regional over the road owner operators settlement rate by two cents per mile effective may  these increases were offset by the decrease in the number of owner operator trucks and the corresponding decrease in owner operator miles 
payments to third party capacity providers related to the small amount of non trucking revenues recorded by the truckload segment also decreased by cent per mile  partially offsetting the truckload segment s overall increase 
other operating expenses for the truckload segment decreased cents per mile in gains on sales of assets increased to million in from million in during  we began selling our oldest van trailers that reached the end of their depreciable life  which increased gains in the number of trucks sold in and the average gain per truck sold before costs to prepare the equipment for sale both decreased slightly in comparison to we spent less on repairs per truck sold in as compared to  which also contributed to the improvement in gains on sale 
other operating expenses also include bad debt expense and professional service fees 
in first quarter  we recorded an additional million related to the bankruptcy of one of our former customers 
we recorded million of interest expense in compared to million of interest expense in we had million of debt outstanding at december  this debt was incurred in the second half of for the purchase of new trucks

liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   we generated cash flow from operations of million  a decrease million  in cash flow compared to the year ended december  this decrease is due primarily to i a change in accounts payable for revenue equipment caused by a million increase in accounts payable for revenue equipment from december to december compared to a million decrease in accounts payable for revenue equipment from december to december as we delayed the purchase of trucks with engines during and ii lower net income in these cash flow decreases were offset partially by working capital improvements in accounts receivable 
cash flow from operations increased million in compared to  or 
the increase in cash flow from operations in compared to was due primarily to lower income tax payments during  higher payables for revenue equipment of million and improved collections of accounts receivable 
in addition  we wrote off a million receivable related to the bankruptcy of a former customer during  resulting in a decrease in net accounts receivable 
income taxes paid during totaled million compared to million in the higher tax payments in were related to tax law changes that resulted in the reversal of certain tax strategies implemented in and the effect of lower income tax depreciation in due to the bonus tax depreciation provision that expired on december  we made federal income tax payments of million related to the reversal of the tax strategies in second quarter we were able to make net capital expenditures  repay debt  repurchase stock and pay dividends because of the cash flow from operations and existing cash balances  supplemented by net borrowings under our existing credit facilities 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million to million in from million in net property additions primarily revenue equipment were million for the year ended december  compared to million during the same period of the decrease occurred because we took delivery of substantially fewer new trucks during to delay purchases of more expensive trucks with engines 
the million  or  decrease in investing cash flows from to was due primarily to i the purchase of more tractors in as we began to reduce the average age of our truck fleet and ii purchasing fewer tractors and selling more trailers in the average age of our truck fleet is years at december  compared to years at december  as of december   we committed to property and equipment purchases of approximately million 
we intend to fund these net capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and financing available under our existing credit facilities  as management deems necessary 
net financing activities used million in  used million in and provided million in the change from to included debt repayments net of borrowings of million in compared to net borrowings of million in we borrowed million in we paid dividends of million in  million in and million in we increased our quarterly dividend rate by per share beginning with the dividend paid in july and the dividend paid in july financing activities also included common stock repurchases of million in  million in and million in from time to time  we have repurchased  and may continue to repurchase  shares of our common stock 
the timing and amount of such purchases depends on market and other factors 
on october   our board of directors approved an increase in the number of shares of our common stock that the company is authorized to repurchase 
this new authorization permits us to repurchase an additional  shares 
as of december   the company had purchased  shares pursuant to this authorization and had  shares remaining available for repurchase 
management believes our financial position at december  is strong 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of stockholders equity 
as of december   we had million of credit pursuant to credit facilities  of which we had no outstanding borrowings 
the million of credit available under these facilities is further reduced by the million in letters of credit we maintain 
these letters of credit are primarily required as security for insurance policies 
as of december   we did not have any non cancelable revenue equipment operating leases and therefore had no off balance sheet revenue equipment debt 
based on our strong financial position  management does not foresee any significant barriers to obtaining sufficient financing  if necessary 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables set forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  caption payments due by period in millions less than over total year years years years other 
del contractual obligations unrecognized tax benefits equipment purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments unused lines of credit standby letters of credit total commercial commitments total obligations del 
we have committed credit facilities with two banks totaling million  of which we had no outstanding borrowings 
these credit facilities bear variable interest based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
the credit available under these facilities is further reduced by the amount of standby letters of credit under which we are obligated 
the unused lines of credit are available to us in the event we need financing for the growth of our fleet 
given our strong financial position  we expect that we could obtain additional financing  if necessary  at favorable terms 
the standby letters of credit are primarily required for insurance policies 
the equipment purchase commitments relate to committed equipment expenditures 
on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  and have recorded million of unrecognized tax benefits 
we are unable to reasonably determine when these amounts will be settled 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have arrangements that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement 
critical accounting policies we operate in the truckload sector of the trucking industry  with a focus on transporting consumer nondurable products that ship more consistently throughout the year and when changes occur in the economy 
our success depends on our ability to efficiently manage our resources in the delivery of truckload transportation and logistics services to our customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand and may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
our ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is a key element in efficient resource deployment and in making capital investments in tractors and trailers 
although our business volume is not highly concentrated  we may also be affected by the financial failure of customers or a loss of a customer s business 
our most significant resource requirements are qualified drivers  tractors  trailers and related equipment operating costs such as fuel and related fuel taxes  driver pay  insurance and supplies and maintenance 
historically  we have successfully mitigated our risk to fuel price increases by recovering from our customers additional fuel surcharges that recoup a majority of the increased fuel costs  however  we cannot assure that current recovery levels will continue in future periods 
our financial results are also affected by company driver and owner operator availability and the new and used revenue equipment market 
because we are self insured for a significant portion of bodily injury  property damage and cargo claims and for workers compensation benefits for our employees supplemented by premium based coverage above certain dollar levels  financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  weather  legal and regulatory environments and insurance coverage costs to protect against catastrophic losses 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect our financial statements include the following selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers range from to years 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sale for example  three years for tractors are based on the expected market values of equipment at the time of disposal 
although our normal replacement cycle for tractors is three years  we calculate depreciation expense for financial reporting purposes using a five year life and salvage value 
depreciation expense calculated in this manner continues at the same straight line rate which approximates the continuing declining market value of the tractors when a tractor is held beyond the normal three year age 
calculating depreciation expense using a five year life and salvage value results in the same annual depreciation rate of cost per year and the same net book value at the normal three year replacement date of cost as using a three year life and salvage value 
we continually monitor the adequacy of the lives and salvage values used in calculating depreciation expense and adjust these assumptions appropriately when warranted 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
for long lived assets classified as held and used  the carrying amount is not recoverable when the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the sum of the future net cash flows 
we do not separately identify assets by operating segment because tractors and trailers are routinely transferred from one operating fleet to another 
as a result  none of our long lived assets have identifiable cash flows from use that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
thus  the asset group used to assess impairment would include all of our assets 
long lived assets classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
estimates of accrued liabilities for insurance and claims for liability and physical damage losses and workers compensation 
the insurance and claims accruals current and noncurrent are recorded at the estimated ultimate payment amounts and are based upon individual case estimates including negative development and estimates of incurred but not reported losses using loss development factors based upon past experience 
an actuary reviews our self insurance reserves for bodily injury and property damage claims and workers compensation claims every six months 
policies for revenue recognition 
operating revenues including fuel surcharge revenues and related direct costs are recorded when the shipment is delivered 
for shipments where a third party capacity provider including owner operators under contract with us is utilized to provide some or all of the service and we i are the primary obligor in regard to the shipment delivery  ii establish customer pricing separately from carrier rate negotiations  iii generally have discretion in carrier selection and or iv have credit risk on the shipment  we record both revenues for the dollar value of services we bill to the customer and rent and purchased transportation expense for transportation costs we pay to the third party provider upon the shipment s delivery 
in the absence of the conditions listed above  we record revenues net of those expenses related to third party providers 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required to determine the provision for income taxes  to determine whether deferred income taxes will be realized in full or in part and to determine the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with the provisions of fin which we adopted january  
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
when it is more likely that all or some portion of specific deferred income tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets has not been deemed to be necessary due to our profitable operations 
accordingly  if facts or financial circumstances changed and consequently impacted the likelihood of realizing the deferred income tax assets  we would need to apply management s judgment to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
together with the effects of the matters discussed above  these factors may significantly impact our results of operations from period to period 
inflation inflation may impact our operating costs 
a prolonged inflation period could cause rises in interest rates  fuel  wages and other costs 
these inflationary increases could adversely affect our results of operations unless freight rates could be increased correspondingly 
however  the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we had no debt outstanding at december  interest rates on our unused credit facilities are based on the libor 
increases in interest rates could impact our annual interest expense on future borrowings 
as of december   we do not have any derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate increases 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations attributed to changes in the level of global oil production  refining capacity  seasonality  weather and other market factors 
historically  we have recovered a significant portion of fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
we implemented customer fuel surcharge programs with most of our revenue base to offset much of the higher fuel cost per gallon 
we cannot predict the extent to which higher fuel price levels will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset such increases 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in mexico  canada and asia 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for and prior years 
to date  most foreign revenues are denominated in us dollars  and we receive payment for foreign freight services primarily in us dollars to reduce direct foreign currency risk 
accordingly  we are not currently subject to material risks involving any foreign currency exchange rate and the effects that such exchange rate movements would have on our future costs or future cash flows
