 the company has presented the operations of first bank of delaware as discontinued operations starting with the first quarter on january  the first bank of delaware was spun off  effective january  all assets  liabilities and equity of first bank of delaware were spun off as an independent company  trading on the otc market under the stock symbol fbod 
shareholders received one share of stock in first bank of delaware  for every share owned of the company 
the short term loan and tax refund lines of business were accordingly transferred after that date 
republic continued to purchase tax refund anticipation loans from the first bank of delaware through however  first bank of delaware decided not to continue with this program in in reviewing and understanding financial information for the company you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
these policies are described in note of the notes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements 
the accounting and financial reporting policies of the company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and to general practices within the banking industry 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis including those related to the allowance for loan losses  other than temporary impairment of securities and deferred income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the bases for making judgments on the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is increased by charges to income through the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs net of recoveries 
the allowance is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to provide for losses based upon evaluation of the known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the company s past loan loss experience  the volume and composition of lending conducted by the company  adverse situations that may affect a borrower s ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral  current economic conditions and other factors affecting the known and inherent risk in the portfolio 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates including  among others  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impacted loans  exposure at default  value of collateral  and estimated losses on our commercial and residential loan portfolios 
all of these estimates may be susceptible to significant change 
the allowance consists of specific allowances for both impaired loans and all classified loans which are not impaired and a general allowance on the remainder of the portfolio 
although we determine the amount of each element of the allowance separately  the entire allowance for loan losses is available for the entire portfolio 
we establish an allowance on certain impaired loans for the amount by which the discounted cash flows  observable market price or fair value of collateral if the loan is collateral dependent is lower than the carrying value of the loan 
a loan is considered to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
an insignificant delay or insignificant shortfall in amount of payments does not necessarily result in the loan being identified as impaired 
we also establish a specific valuation allowance on classified loans which are not impaired 
we segregate these loans by category and assign allowances to each loan based on inherent losses associated with each type of lending and consideration that these loans  in the aggregate  represent an above average credit risk and that more of these loans will prove to be uncollectible compared to loans in the general portfolio 
the categories used by the company include doubtful  substandard and special mention 
classification of a loan within such categories is based on identified weaknesses that increase the credit risk of the loan 
we establish a general allowance on non classified loans to recognize the inherent losses associated with lending activities  but which  unlike specific allowances  have not been allocated to particular problem loans 
this general valuation allowance is determined by segregating the loans by loan category and assigning allowance percentages based on our historical loss experience  delinquency trends  and management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
the allowance is adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
these significant factors may include changes in lending policies and procedures  changes in existing general economic and business conditions affecting our primary lending areas  credit quality trends  collateral value  loan volumes and concentrations  seasoning of the loan portfolio  loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio  duration of the current business cycle  and bank regulatory examination results 
the applied loss factors are reevaluated each reporting period to ensure their relevance in the current economic environment 
while management uses the best information available to make loan loss allowance valuations  adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio or changes in accounting guidance 
in times of economic slowdown  either regional or national  the risk inherent in the loan portfolio could increase resulting in the need for additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses in future periods 
an increase could also be necessitated by an increase in the size of the loan portfolio or in any of its components even though the credit quality of the overall portfolio may be improving 
historically  our estimates of the allowance for loan loss have approximated actual losses incurred 
in addition  the pennsylvania department of banking and the fdic  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
the pennsylvania department of banking or the fdic may require the recognition of adjustment to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from management s estimates  additional provisions to the allowance for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 
other than temporary impairment of securities securities are evaluated on at least a quarterly basis  and more frequently when market conditions warrant such an evaluation  to determine whether a decline in their value is other than temporary 
to determine whether a loss in value is other than temporary  management utilizes criteria such as the reasons underlying the decline  the magnitude and duration of the decline and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the security for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in the fair value 
the term other than temporary is not intended to indicate that the decline is permanent  but indicates that the prospects for a near term recovery of value is not necessarily favorable  or that there is a lack of evidence to support a realizable value equal to or greater than the carrying value of the investment 
once a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the value of the security is reduced and a corresponding charge to earnings is recognized 
income taxes management makes estimates and judgments to calculate various tax liabilities and determine the recoverability of various deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenues and expenses 
management also estimates a reserve for deferred tax assets if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
these estimates and judgments are inherently subjective 
historically  our estimates and judgments to calculate our deferred tax accounts have not required significant revision 
in evaluating our ability to recover deferred tax assets  management considers all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results and our forecast of future taxable income 
in determining future taxable income  management makes assumptions for the amount of taxable income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require us to make judgments about our future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our business 
any reduction in estimated future taxable income may require us to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an increase in the valuation allowance would result in additional income tax expense in the period and could have a significant impact on our future earnings

results of operations for the years ended december  and overview the company s net income decreased million  or  to million or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share for the prior year 
there was a million  or  increase in total interest income  reflecting a increase in average loans outstanding and a increase in average investment securities while interest expense increased million reflecting a increase in average interest bearing deposits outstanding and higher rates as well as a increase in average borrowings outstanding 
accordingly  net interest income decreased million 
contributing to the million decrease in net interest income was the impact of million in net interest income related to tax refund loans in which was not earned in due to the discontinuation of the program 
also there were interest reductions due to the increase in non performing loans in the provision for loan losses in increased  to million  compared to million in  reflecting the impact of a increase in non accrual loans as well as an increase in reserves on certain loans due to a downturn in the housing market which was offset by  in net tax refund recoveries in versus  in net tax refund charge offs in non interest income decreased  to million in compared to million in non interest expenses increased  to million compared to million in return on average assets and average equity of and respectively in compared to and respectively in analysis of net interest income historically  the company s earnings have depended primarily upon republic s net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is affected by changes in the mix of the volume and rates of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the following table provides an analysis of net interest income on an annualized basis  setting forth for the periods i average assets  liabilities  and shareholders equity  ii interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  iii average yields earned on interest earning assets and average rates on interest bearing liabilities  and iv republic s net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average total interest earning assets

both net interest income and net interest margin were increased in and over the financial statement amount  to adjust for tax equivalency 
rate volume analysis of changes in net interest income net interest income may also be analyzed by segregating the volume and rate components of interest income and interest expense

the increase in yields on deposits was due to the repricing of maturing time deposits at higher rates and increases in rates on money market and savings deposits 
the cost of overnight borrowings decreased slightly as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve but those actions had limited immediate impact in reducing the cost of deposits 
the company s tax equivalent net interest income decreased million  or  to million for from million for as shown in the rate volume table above  the decrease in net interest income was due primarily to higher rates on deposits and lower rates on loans as discussed in the previous paragraph

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that reflects the known and inherent losses in the portfolio 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million for compared to million for the provision reflected  for net charge offs of tax refund loans  which were more than offset by million in related net revenues 
the comparable provision reflected  for net recoveries on tax refund loans 
this favorable variance was more than offset by an increase in the provision for loan losses of million for loans transferred to non accrual status in and  for increases in reserves on certain loans due to a downturn in the housing market 
those increases were partially offset by the reversal of reserves on loans which were paid down or otherwise disposed of 
the remaining provisions in both both periods also reflected amounts required to increase the allowance for loan growth in accordance with the company s methodology 
non accrual loans increased from million at december  to million at december  non interest income total non interest income decreased  to million for compared to million for  primarily due to a decrease of  related to service fees on deposit accounts 
the decrease in service fees on deposit accounts reflected the termination of services to several large customers

the effective tax rates in those periods were amd  respectively 
results of operations for the years ended december  and overview the company s net income increased million  or  to million or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to million  or per diluted share for the prior year 
the improvement reflected a million  or  increase in total interest income  due primarily to a increase in average loans outstanding and secondarily to higher rates 
interest expense increased million  also reflecting higher rates  a increase in average deposits outstanding and a in average borrowings outstanding 
accordingly  net interest income increased million 
partially offsetting the increase in net interest income were the provision for loan losses up approximately thousand  non interest income level with at million  and non interest expenses up million 
the decrease in return on average assets and average equity from and respectively in compared to and respectively in  resulted primarily from increased funding costs 
net interest income the company s tax equivalent net interest margin decreased basis points to for compared to for while yields on interest earning assets increased basis points to in from in  the yield on total deposits and other borrowings increased basis points to from between and the increases in yields on assets and cost of funds resulted primarily from the basis points of increases in short term interest rates between the two periods 
the resulting decrease in margin reflected an increase in interest bearing assets of million  while interest bearing liabilities increased million 
the company s tax equivalent net interest income increased million  or  to million for from million for as shown in the rate volume table above  the increase in net interest income was due primarily to the increased volume of loans 
higher rates on loans resulted primarily from variable rate loans which immediately adjust to increases in the prime rate 
interest expense increased primarily as a result of higher rates  resulting from the higher short term interest rate environment  and also reflected the impact of the increase in higher cost time deposit balances 
the company s total tax equivalent interest income increased million  or  to million for  from million for interest and fees on loans increased million to million for  from million for the majority of the increase resulted from a increase in average loan balances 
for  average loan balances amounted to million  compared to million in the balance of the increase in interest on loans resulted primarily from the repricing of the variable rate loan portfolio to higher short term market interest rates 
tax equivalent interest and dividends on investment securities increased million to million for  from million for this increase reflected rate increases on variable rate securities as well as an increase in average securities outstanding to million for from million for interest on federal funds sold and other interest earning assets increased  or  to million for from million for as increases in short term market interest rates more than offset the million decrease in average balances to million for from million for the company s total interest expense increased million  or  to million for  from million for interest bearing liabilities averaged million for  from million for  an increase of million 
the increase reflected additional funding utilized for loan growth 
average time deposit certificates of deposit balances increased million  or  to million for from million in while lower cost average transaction account balances declined million  or  to million for from million for the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to for money market and savings expense increased million to million for from million for  due almost entirely to increases in short term rates as average balances increased million  or 
interest expense on time deposits increased million  or  to million for from million for  primarily as a result of the increased average balances as well as rates 
as time deposits mature  they frequently reprice at market rates which are currently or more 
interest expense on other borrowings increased million to million for from million for  primarily as a result of higher short term rates 
average other borrowings  primarily overnight fhlb borrowings  increased million  or  to million for from million for rates on overnight borrowings reflected the higher short term interest rate environment as the rate on other borrowings increased to for from for interest expense on other borrowings also includes the interest expense on million of trust preferred securities which was approximately  and  in and  respectively 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is charged to operations in an amount necessary to bring the total allowance for loan losses to a level that reflects the known and estimated inherent losses in the portfolio 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million in the provision reflected  for net losses on tax refund loans  which were more than offset by million in related revenues  and amounts required to increase the allowance for loan growth in accordance with the company s methodology 
the prior year provision of million reflected  for net losses on tax refund loans  which more than offset by million in related revenues 
in addition  the provision was reduced as a result of a  recovery on a commercial loan which had been charged off in the prior year 
that recovery resulted in an allowance balance which exceeded the level deemed necessary by the company s methodology and the provision was reduced accordingly

the effective tax rates in those periods were comparable at and respectively 
financial condition december  compared to december  total assets increased million to billion at december   compared to billion at december  this net increase reflected a higher balance in loans offset by lower balances in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities 
loans the loan portfolio  which represents the company s largest asset  is its most significant source of interest income 
the company s lending strategy is to focus on small and medium sized businesses and professionals that seek highly personalized banking services 
total loans increased million  or  to million at december   versus million at december  the increase reflected million  or  of growth in commercial and construction loans 
the loan portfolio consists of secured and unsecured commercial loans including commercial real estate  construction loans  residential mortgages  automobile loans  home improvement loans  home equity loans and lines of credit  overdraft lines of credit and others 
republic s commercial loans typically range between  and  but customers may borrow significantly larger amounts up to republic s legal lending limit of approximately million at december  individual customers may have several loans that are secured by different collateral which are in total subject to that lending limit 
the aggregate amount of those relationships that exceeded million at december   was million 
the million threshold approximates of total capital and reflects an additional internal monitoring guideline 
investment securities investment securities available for sale are investments which may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions and for liquidity and other purposes 
the company s investment securities available for sale consist primarily of u 
s government debt securities  us government agency issued mortgage backed securities  municipal securities and debt securities  which include corporate bonds and trust preferred securities 
available for sale securities totaled million at december   a decrease of million  or  from year end this decrease reflected million in proceeds from maturities and calls on securities partially offset by million in purchases of primarily mortgage backed and municipal securities 
the purchases were made to decrease exposure to lower interest rate environments  and enhance net interest income 
at december  and december   the portfolio had net unrealized gains of  and  respectively 
investment securities held to maturity are investments for which there is the intent and ability to hold the investment to maturity 
these investments are carried at amortized cost 
the held to maturity portfolio consists primarily of debt securities and stocks 
at december   securities held to maturity totaled  a decrease of  or  from  at year end the decline reflected a reduction in the amount of debt securities 
at both dates  respective carrying values approximated market values

at december  and  acbb stock totaled  cash and cash equivalents cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits and federal funds sold comprise this category which consists of the company s most liquid assets 
the aggregate amount in these three categories decreased by million  to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to an million decrease in cash and due from banks 
fixed assets bank premises and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation totaled million at december  an increase of million  or from million at december   reflecting main office expenditures and branch expansion 
other real estate owned at december   the company had assets classified as other real estate owned with a value of million comprised of a tract development project for single family homes with a value of million  a commercial building with a value of  and a parcel of land with a value of  at december   the company had parcels of land classified as other real estate owned with a value of  of which assets valued at  were sold in bank owned life insurance at december   the value of the insurance was million  an increase of  or  from million at december  the increase reflected income earned on the insurance policies 
other assets other assets decreased by million to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to the effect of a million adjustment to the deferred tax asset offset in other liabilities partially offset by an increase of  in assets related to a deferred compensation plan 
deposits deposits  which include non interest and interest bearing demand deposits  money market  savings and time deposits including some brokered deposits  are republic s major source of funding 
deposits are generally solicited from the company s market area through the offering of a variety of products to attract and retain customers  with a primary focus on multi product relationships

shareholders equity total shareholders equity increased million to million at december   versus million at december  this increase was primarily the result of net income of million  partially offset by million for the purchase of treasury shares 
commitments  contingencies and concentrations the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements 
credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss due to the failure of the other parties to a financial instrument to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract 
the maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
the company uses the same underwriting standards and policies in making credit commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk are commitments to extend credit of approximately million and million and standby letters of credit of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
the million of commitments to extend credit at december   were substantially all variable rate commitments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and many require the payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include real estate  marketable securities  pledged deposits  equipment and accounts receivable 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk and collateral policy involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments 
the amount of collateral obtained is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include real estate  marketable securities  pledged deposits  equipment and accounts receivable 
contingencies also include a standby letter of credit issued by an unrelated bank in the amount of  which was required by a lessor 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of december  dollars in thousands total less than one year one to three years three to five years after five years minimum annual rentals or noncancellable operating leases remaining contractual maturities of time deposits subordinated debt employment agreements former ceo serp director and officer retirement plan obligations loan commitments standby letters of credit total as of december   the company had entered into non cancelable lease agreements for its main office and operations center  ten current republic retail branch facilities  and a new branch facility scheduled to open in  expiring through august   including renewal options 
the leases are accounted for as operating leases 
the minimum annual rental payments required under these leases are million through the year the company has entered into employment agreements with the ceo of the company and the president of republic 
the aggregate commitment for future salaries and benefits under these employment agreements at december  is approximately million 
the company has retirement plan agreements with certain directors and officers 
the accrued benefits under the plan at december  was approximately million  with a minimum age of established to qualify for the payments 
the company and republic are from time to time a party plaintiff or defendant to lawsuits that are in the normal course of business 
while any litigation involves an element of uncertainty  management  after reviewing pending actions with its legal counsel  is of the opinion that the liability of the company and republic  if any  resulting from such actions will not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company and republic 
at december   the company had no foreign loans and no loan concentrations exceeding of total loans except for credits extended to real estate operators and lessors in the aggregate amount of million  which represented of gross loans receivable at december  various types of real estate are included in this category  including industrial  retail shopping centers  office space  residential multi family and others 
in addition  credits extended for single family construction amounted to million  which represented of gross loans receivable at december  loan concentrations are considered to exist when there is amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities that management believes would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk management involves managing the extent to which interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities are matched 
the company attempts to optimize net interest income while managing period to period fluctuations therein 
the company typically defines interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities as those that reprice within one year or less 
the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities is known as the interest sensitivity gap gap 
a positive gap occurs when interest sensitive assets exceed interest sensitive liabilities repricing in the same time periods  and a negative gap occurs when interest sensitive liabilities exceed interest sensitive assets repricing in the same time periods 
a negative gap ratio suggests that a financial institution may be better positioned to take advantage of declining interest rates rather than increasing interest rates  and a positive gap ratio suggests the converse 
static gap analysis describes interest rate sensitivity at a point in time 
however  it alone does not accurately measure the magnitude of changes in net interest income since changes in interest rates do not impact all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
interest rate sensitivity analysis also requires assumptions about repricing certain categories of assets and liabilities 
for purposes of interest rate sensitivity analysis  assets and liabilities are stated at either their contractual maturity  estimated likely call date  or earliest repricing opportunity 
mortgage backed securities and amortizing loans are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow  including prepayments based on historical data and current market trends 
savings  money market and interest bearing demand accounts do not have a stated maturity or repricing term and can be withdrawn or repriced at any time 
management estimates the repricing characteristics of these accounts based on historical performance and other deposit behavior assumptions 
these deposits are not considered to reprice simultaneously and  accordingly  a portion of the deposits are moved into time brackets exceeding one year 
however  management may choose not to reprice liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest rates  for competitive or other reasons 
shortcomings  inherent in a simplified and static gap analysis  may result in an institution with a negative gap having interest rate behavior associated with an asset sensitive balance sheet 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
furthermore  repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given time period 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and other cash flows could also deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating gap in the manner presented in the table below 
the company attempts to manage its assets and liabilities in a manner that optimizes net interest income in a range of interest rate environments 
management uses gap analysis and simulation models to monitor behavior of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
adjustments to the mix of assets and liabilities are made periodically in an effort to provide steady growth in net interest income 
management presently believes that the effect on republic of any future fall in interest rates  reflected in lower yielding assets  could be detrimental since republic may not have the immediate ability to commensurately decrease rates on its interest bearing liabilities  primarily time deposits  other borrowings and certain transaction accounts 
an increase in interest rates could have a negative effect on republic  due to a possible lag in the repricing of core deposits not assumed in the model 
the following tables present a summary of the company s interest rate sensitivity gap at december  amounts shown in the table include both estimated maturities and instruments scheduled to reprice  including prime based loans 
for purposes of these tables  the company has used assumptions based on industry data and historical experience to calculate the expected maturity of loans because  statistically  certain categories of loans are prepaid before their maturity date  even without regard to interest rate fluctuations 
additionally  certain prepayment assumptions were made with regard to investment securities based upon the expected prepayment of the underlying collateral of the mortgage backed securities 
the interest rate on the trust preferred securities is variable and adjusts semi annually 
interest sensitivity gap at december  dollars in thousands days days days years years years years more than years financial statement total fair value interest sensitive assets investment securities and other interest bearing balances average interest rate loans receivable average interest rate total cumulative totals interest sensitive liabilities demand interest bearing average interest rate savings accounts average interest rate money market accounts average interest rate time deposits average interest rate fhlb and short term advances average interest rate subordinated debt average interest rate total cumulative totals interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative gap interest sensitive assets interest sensitive liabilities cumulative gap total earning assets demand  savings and money market accounts are shown to reprice based upon management s estimate of when rates would have to be increased to retain balances in response to competition 
such estimates are necessarily arbitrary and wholly judgmental 
in addition to the gap analysis  the company utilizes income simulation modeling in measuring its interest rate risk and managing its interest rate sensitivity 
income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on forecasted net interest income  but also other factors such a yield curve relationships  the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and general market conditions 
net portfolio value and net interest income analysis 
our interest rate sensitivity also is monitored by management through the use of models which generate estimates of the change in its net portfolio value npv and net interest income nii over a range of interest rate scenarios 
npv is the present value of expected cash flows from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet contracts 
the npv ratio  under any interest rate scenario  is defined as the npv in that scenario divided by the market value of assets in the same scenario 
the following table sets forth our npv as of december  and reflects the changes to npv as a result of immediate and sustained changes in interest rates as indicated 
change in interest rates net portfolio value npv as of portfolio value of assets in basis points rate shock amount change change npv ratio change dollars in thousands bp bp static in addition to modeling changes in npv  we also analyze potential changes to nii for a twelve month period under rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the following table shows our nii model as of december  change in interest rates in basis points rate shock net interest income change change dollars in thousands bp static the above table indicates that as of december   in the event of an immediate and sustained basis point increase in interest rates  the company s net interest income for the months ending december   subject to the significant limitations specified in the following paragraph  might decrease by million over the static scenario 
as is the case with the gap table  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurements 
modeling changes in npv and nii require the making of certain assumptions which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the models presented assume that the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv measurements and net interest income models provide an indication of interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and will differ from actual results 
it is unlikely that the increases in net interest income shown in the table would occur  if deposit rates continue to lag prime rate reductions 
the company s management believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating the company s estimated net interest income are reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based 
periodically  the company may and does make significant changes to underlying assumptions  which are wholly judgmental 
prepayments on residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities have increased over historical levels due to the lower interest rate environment  and may result in reductions in margins 
capital resources the company is required to comply with certain risk based capital adequacy guidelines issued by the frb and the fdic 
the risk based capital guidelines assign varying risk weights to the individual assets held by a bank 
the guidelines also assign weights to the credit equivalent amounts of certain off balance sheet items  such as letters of credit and interest rate and currency swap contracts 
under these guidelines  banks are expected to meet a minimum target ratio for qualifying total capital to weighted risk assets of  at least one half of which is to be in the form of tier capital 
qualifying total capital is divided into two separate categories or tiers 
tier capital includes common stockholders equity  certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill  tier capital components limited in the aggregate to one half of total qualifying capital includes allowances for credit losses within limits  certain excess levels of perpetual preferred stock and certain types of hybrid capital instruments  subordinated debt and other preferred stock 
applying the federal guidelines  the ratio of qualifying total capital to weighted risk assets  was and at december  and  respectively  and as required by the guidelines  at least one half of the qualifying total capital consisted of tier l capital elements 
tier l risk based capital ratios on december  and were and  respectively 
at december  and  the company exceeded the requirements for risk based capital adequacy under both federal and pennsylvania state guidelines 
under frb and fdic regulations  a bank and a holding company are deemed to be well capitalized when it has a leverage ratio tier l capital to total assets of at least  a tier l capital to weighted risk assets ratio of at least  and a total capital to weighted risk assets ratio of at least 
at december  and  the company s leverage ratio was and  respectively 
accordingly  at december  and  the company was considered well capitalized under frb and fdic regulations 
on november   republic first bancorp  inc  through a pooled offering with sandler o neill partners  issued million of corporation obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities of the subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of the corporation more commonly known as trust preferred securities 
the purpose of the issuance was to increase capital as a result of the company s continued loan and core deposit growth 
the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital for regulatory purposes in amounts up to of total tier capital 
the company had the ability to call the securities on any interest payment date after five years  without a prepayment penalty  notwithstanding their final year maturity 
the interest rate was variable and adjustable semi annually at over the month london interbank offered rate libor 
the company did call the securities in december and then issued million in trust preferred securities at a variable interest rate  adjustable quarterly  at over the month libor 
the company may call the securities on any interest payment date after five years 
on june   the company  through a pooled offering  issued an additional million of corporation obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities of the subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of the corporation more commonly known as trust preferred securities for the same purpose as the issuance 
the company has the ability to call the securities or any interest payment date after five years  without a prepayment penalty  notwithstanding their final year maturity 
the interest rate is variable  adjustable quarterly  at over the month libor 
the shareholders equity of the company as of december   totaled approximately million compared to approximately million as of december  this increase of million reflected net income of million  less million for the purchase of treasury shares 
that net income increased the book value per share of the company s common stock from as of december   based upon  shares outstanding restated for a stock dividend  to as of december   based upon  shares outstanding at december   as adjusted for treasury stock 
regulatory capital requirements federal banking agencies impose three minimum capital requirements on the company s risk based capital ratios based on total capital  tier capital  and a leverage capital ratio 
the risk based capital ratios measure the adequacy of a bank s capital against the riskiness of its assets and off balance sheet activities 
failure to maintain adequate capital is a basis for prompt corrective action or other regulatory enforcement action 
in assessing a bank s capital adequacy  regulators also consider other factors such as interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  funding and market risks  quality and level or earnings  concentrations of credit  quality of loans and investments  risks of any nontraditional activities  effectiveness of bank policies  and management s overall ability to monitor and control risks 
the following table presents the company s regulatory capital ratios at december  and actual for capital adequacy purposes to be well capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines dollars in thousands amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio at december  total risk based capital republic company tier one risk based capital republic company tier one leverage capital republic company 
at december  total risk based capital republic company tier one risk based capital republic company tier one leverage capital republic company management believes that the company and republic met  as of december  and  all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
as of december   the fdic categorized republic as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action provisions of the federal deposit insurance act 
there are no calculations or events since that notification  which management believes would have changed republic s category 
the company and republic s ability to maintain the required levels of capital is substantially dependent upon the success of their capital and business plans  the impact of future economic events on republic s loan customers and republic s ability to manage its interest rate risk  growth and other operating expenses 
in addition to the above minimum capital requirements  the federal reserve bank approved a rule that became effective on december   implementing a statutory requirement that federal banking regulators take specified prompt corrective action when an insured institution s capital level falls below certain levels 
the rule defines five capital categories based on several of the above capital ratios 
republic currently exceeds the levels required for a bank to be classified as well capitalized 
however  the federal reserve bank may consider other criteria when determining such classifications  which criteria could result in a downgrading in such classifications 
the company s equity to assets ratio increased to as of december   from as of december  the increase at year end was the result of net income of million 
the company s average equity to assets ratio for  and was  and  respectively 
the company s average return on equity for  and was  and  respectively  and its average return on assets for  and  was  and  respectively 
liquidity financial institutions must maintain liquidity to meet day to day requirements of depositors and borrowers  time investment purchases to market conditions and provide a cushion against unforeseen needs 
liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities 
the most liquid assets consist of cash  amounts due from banks and federal funds sold 
regulatory authorities require the company to maintain certain liquidity ratios such that republic maintains available funds  or can obtain available funds at reasonable rates  in order to satisfy commitments to borrowers and the demands of depositors 
in response to these requirements  the company has formed an asset liability committee alco  comprised of certain members of republic s board of directors and senior management  which monitors such ratios 
the purpose of the committee is  in part  to monitor republic s liquidity and adherence to the ratios in addition to managing relative interest rate risk 
the alco meets at least quarterly 
the company s most liquid assets  comprised of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  loan maturities and repayments are another source of asset liquidity 
at december   republic estimated that in excess of million of loans would mature or repay in the six month period ended june  additionally  the majority of its securities are available to satisfy liquidity requirements through pledges to the fhlb to access republic s line of credit 
funding requirements have historically been satisfied by generating core deposits and certificates of deposit with competitive rates  buying federal funds or utilizing the facilities of the federal home loan bank system fhlb 
at december   republic had million in unused lines of credit available under arrangements with the fhlb and with correspondent banks  compared to million at december  the increase in available lines resulted from republic s decreased level of overnight borrowings against these lines 
management believes it satisfactorily exceeds regulatory liquidity guidelines 
these lines of credit enable republic to purchase funds for short to long term needs at rates often lower than other sources and require pledging of securities or loan collateral 
at december   the company had outstanding commitments including unused lines of credit and letters of credit of million 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year totaled million at december  the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current commitments 
in addition  the company can use term borrowings to replace these borrowed funds 
republic s target and actual liquidity levels are determined by comparisons of the estimated repayment and marketability of republic s interest earning assets with projected future outflows of deposits and other liabilities 
republic has established a contingency line of credit with a correspondent bank to assist in managing republic s liquidity position 
that line of credit totaled million at december  republic had drawn down on this line at december  republic has also established a line of credit with the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh with a maximum borrowing capacity of approximately million 
that million capacity is reduced by advances outstanding to arrive at the unused line of credit available 
as of december  and  republic had borrowed million and million  respectively from the fhlb 
investment securities represent a primary source of liquidity for republic 
accordingly  investment decisions generally reflect liquidity over other considerations 
additionally  republic has uncollateralized overnight advances with pnc 
as of december  and  there were million and million of such overnight advances outstanding 
operating cash flows are primarily derived from cash provided from net income during the year and are another source of liquidity 
the company s primary short term funding sources are certificates of deposit and its securities portfolio 
the circumstances that are reasonably likely to affect those sources are as follows 
republic has historically been able to generate certificates of deposit by matching philadelphia market rates or paying a premium rate of to basis points over those market rates 
it is anticipated that this source of liquidity will continue to be available  however  the incremental cost may vary depending on market conditions 
the company s securities portfolio is also available for liquidity  most likely as collateral for fhlb advances 
because of the fhlb s aaa rating  it is unlikely those advances would not be available 
but even if they are not  numerous investment companies would likely provide repurchase agreements up to the amount of the market value of the securities 
the alco committee is responsible for managing the liquidity position and interest sensitivity of republic 
that committee s primary objective is to maximize net interest income while configuring republic s interest sensitive assets and liabilities to manage interest rate risk and provide adequate liquidity for projected needs 
investment securities portfolio republic s investment securities portfolio is intended to provide liquidity and contribute to earnings while diversifying credit risk 
the company attempts to maximize earnings while minimizing its exposure to interest rate risk 
the securities portfolio consists primarily of us government agency securities  mortgage backed securities  municipal securities  corporate bonds and trust preferred securities 
the company s alco monitors and approves all security purchases 
the increase in securities in was a result of the company s desire to reduce its exposure to lower rate environments  by purchasing long term bonds 
the decline in securities in primarily reflected the maturity of an eighteen month security

commercial loans are primarily secured term loans made to small to medium sized businesses and professionals for working capital  asset acquisition and other purposes 
commercial loans are originated as either fixed or variable rate loans with typical terms of to years 
republic s commercial loans typically range between  and million but customers may borrow significantly larger amounts up to republic s legal lending limit of approximately million at december  individual customers may have several loans often secured by different collateral 
such relationships in excess of million an internal monitoring guideline which approximates of capital and reserves at december   amounted to million 
there were no loans in excess of the legal lending limit at december  the company s total loans increased million  or  to million at december   from million at december  that increase reflected a million  or  increase in real estate secured loans  which represents the company s largest loan portfolio 
the increase also reflected a million  or  increase in construction loans

a committee of the board of directors oversees the loan approval process to monitor that proper standards are maintained  while approving the majority of commercial loans 
loans  including impaired loans  are generally classified as non accrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of interest or principal for a period of more than days  unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than days may also be classified as non accrual if repayment in full of principal and or interest is in doubt 
loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time  and there is a sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower  in accordance with the contractual terms 
while a loan is classified as non accrual or as an impaired loan and the future collectibility of the recorded loan balance is doubtful  collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to principal outstanding 
when the future collectibility of the recorded loan balance is expected  interest income may be recognized on a cash basis 
for non accrual loans which have been partially charged off  recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate 
cash interest receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge offs have been fully recovered

the company s board of directors periodically reviews the status of all non accrual and impaired loans and loans classified by republic s regulators or internal loan review officer  who reviews both the loan portfolio and overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the board of directors also considers specific loans  pools of similar loans  historical charge off activity  economic conditions and other relevant factors in reviewing the adequacy of the loan loss reserve 
any additions deemed necessary to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operating expenses 
the company has an existing loan review program  which monitors the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis 
loan review is conducted by a loan review officer who reports quarterly  directly to the board of directors 
estimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses at any given date is difficult  particularly in a continually changing economy 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at december  however  there can be no assurance that  if asset quality deteriorates in future periods  additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be required 
republic s management is unable to determine in which loan category future charge offs and recoveries may occur 
the following schedule sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories 
the allocation is accordingly based upon historical experience

includes loans held for sale 
the methodology utilized to estimate the amount of the allowance for loan losses is as follows the company first applies an estimated loss percentage against all loans which are not specifically reserved 
in  excluding tax refund loans  the company experienced net charge offs to average loans of approximately 
net recoveries and net charge offs  respectively  excluding short term and tax refund loans  to average loans were   and in   and in the absence of sustained charge off history  management estimates loss percentages based upon the purpose and or collateral of various commercial loan categories 
while such loss percentages exceed the percentages suggested by historical experience  the company maintained those percentages in the company will continue to evaluate these percentages and may adjust these estimates on the basis of charge off history  economic conditions  industry experience or other relevant factors 
the company also provides specific reserves for impaired loans to the extent the estimated realizable value of the underlying collateral is less than the loan balance  when the collateral is the only source of repayment 
also  the company estimates and recognizes reserve allocations on loans classified as doubtful  substandard or special mention based upon any factor that might impact loss estimates 
those factors include but are not limited to the impact of economic conditions on the borrower and management s potential alternative strategies for loan or collateral disposition 
at december   the unallocated component increased  to  from  at december  the unallocated component decreased  from  at december  to  at december  as the company integrated the revised interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan losses issued by the fdic in december as of december   the unallocated component decreased  to  from  at december  total loans at december   increased to million from million at the prior year end 
the unallocated allowance is established for losses that have not been identified through the formulaic and other specific components of the allowance as described above 
the unallocated portion is more subjective and requires a high degree of management judgment and experience 
management has identified several factors that impact credit losses that are not considered in either the formula or the specific allowance segments 
these factors consist of macro and micro economic conditions  industry and geographic loan concentrations  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  changes in underwriting processes and trends in problem loan and loss recovery rates 
the impact of the above is considered in light of management s conclusions as to the overall adequacy of underlying collateral and other factors 
the majority of the company s loan portfolio represents loans made for commercial purposes  while significant amounts of residential property may serve as collateral for such loans 
the company attempts to evaluate larger loans individually  on the basis of its loan review process  which scrutinizes loans on a selective basis  and other available information 
even if all commercial purpose loans could be reviewed  there is no assurance that information on potential problems would be available

fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which voting rights are not effective in identifying the investor with the controlling financial interest 
an entity is subject to consolidation under fin if the investors either do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  are unable to direct the entity s activities  or are not exposed to the entity s losses or entitled to its residual returns variable interest entities 
variable interest entities within the scope of fin will be required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is determined to be the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected returns  or both 
management previously determined that republic first capital trust i  utilized for the company s  of pooled trust preferred securities issuance  qualifies as a variable interest entity under fin republic first capital trust i rfct originally issued mandatorily redeemable preferred stock to investors and loaned the proceeds to the company 
the securities were subsequently reissued via a call during by republic first capital trust ii 
republic first capital trust ii holds  as its sole asset  subordinated debentures issued by the company in the company issued an additional  of pooled trust preferred securities in june republic first capital trust iii holds  as its sole asset  subordinated debentures issued by the company in the company does not consolidate rfct 
fin r precludes consideration of the call option embedded in the preferred stock when determining if the company has the right to a majority of rfct s expected residual returns 
the non consolidation results in the investment in the common stock of rfct to be included in other assets with a corresponding increase in outstanding debt of  in addition  the income received on the company s common stock investment is included in other income 
the adoption of fin r did not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations 
the federal reserve has issued final guidance on the regulatory capital treatment for the trust preferred securities issued by rfct as a result of the adoption of fin r 
the final rule would retain the current maximum percentage of total capital permitted for trust preferred securities at  but would enact other changes to the rules governing trust preferred securities that affect their use as part of the collection of entities known as restricted core capital elements 
the rule would take effect march   however  a five year transition period starting march  and leading up to that date would allow bank holding companies to continue to count trust preferred securities as tier capital after applying fin r 
management has evaluated the effects of the final rule and does not anticipate a material impact on its capital ratios 
effects of inflation the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
therefore  a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
management believes that the most significant impact of inflation on financial results is the company s need and ability to react to changes in interest rates 
as discussed previously  management attempts to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over a one year time horizon in order to protect net interest income from being affected by wide interest rate fluctuations
