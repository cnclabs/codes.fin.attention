item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  the application of which requires management judgments and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any  at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  contains a comprehensive summary of our significant accounting policies 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies  estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in our application of gaap 
critical accounting estimates revenue recognition matrix service records profits on fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis  primarily based on costs incurred to date compared to the total estimated contract cost 
matrix service records revenue on reimbursable and time and material contracts on a proportional performance basis as costs are incurred 
contracts in process are valued at cost plus accrued profits less billings on uncompleted contracts 
contracts are generally considered substantially complete when field construction is completed 
the elapsed time from award of a contract to completion of performance may be in excess of one year 
matrix service includes pass through revenue and costs on cost plus contracts  which are customer reimbursable materials  equipment and subcontractor costs  when matrix service determines that it is responsible for the procurement and management of such cost components on behalf of the customer 
matrix service has numerous contracts that are in various stages of completion which require estimates to determine the appropriate cost and revenue recognition 
matrix service has a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs  and accordingly  does not believe significant fluctuations are likely to materialize 
however  current estimates may be revised as additional information becomes available 
if estimates of costs to complete fixed price contracts indicate a loss  a provision is made through a contract write down for the total loss anticipated 
a number of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives and penalties that impact the earnings we realize from our contracts 
adjustments related to these incentives and penalties are recorded in the period on a percentage of completion basis when estimable and probable 
indirect costs such as salaries and benefits  supplies and tools  equipment costs and insurance costs are charged to projects based upon direct labor hours and overhead allocation rates per direct labor hour 
warranty costs are normally incurred prior to project completion and are charged to project costs as they are incurred 
warranty costs incurred subsequent to project completion were not material for the periods presented 
overhead allocation rates are established annually during the budgeting process and evaluated for accuracy throughout the year based upon actual direct labor hours and actual costs incurred 

table of contents claims recognition claims are amounts in excess of the agreed contract price or amounts not included in the original contract price that we seek to collect from customers or others for delays  errors in specifications and designs  contract terminations  change orders in dispute or unapproved as to both scope and price or other causes of anticipated additional costs incurred by us 
recognition of amounts as additional contract revenue related to claims is appropriate only if it is probable that the claims will result in additional contract revenue and if the amount can be reliably estimated 
we must determine if there is a legal basis for the claim  the additional costs were caused by circumstances that were unforeseen by the company and are not the result of deficiencies in our performance  the costs are identifiable or determinable and are reasonable in view of the work performed  and the evidence supporting the claim is objective and verifiable 
if all of these requirements are met  revenue from a claim is recorded only to the extent that we have incurred costs relating to the claim 
as of may  and may   costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included revenues  for unapproved change orders of million and million  respectively 
at may  costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts included revenues for other claims of million 
there were no claims included in costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts as of may  historically  our collections for unapproved change orders and other claims have approximated the amount of revenue recognized 
the following table provides a rollforward of revenue recognized on claims and unapproved change orders 
amounts disclosed for unapproved change orders exclude amounts associated with contract disputes disclosed in note contingencies 
claims for unapproved change orders other claims total in thousands balance at may  additions collections loss balance at may  additions collections loss balance at may  loss contingencies various legal actions  claims  and other contingencies arise in the normal course of our business 
contingencies are recorded in the consolidated financial statements  or are otherwise disclosed  in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
specific reserves are provided for loss contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable 
we use a case by case evaluation of the underlying data and update our evaluation as further information becomes known 
we believe that any amounts exceeding our recorded accruals should not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
however  the results of litigation are inherently unpredictable and the possibility exists that the ultimate resolution of one or more of these matters could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
legal costs are expensed as incurred 

table of contents insurance reserves we maintain insurance coverage for various aspects of our operations 
however  we retain exposure to potential losses through the use of deductibles  coverage limits and self insured retentions 
as of may  and may   insurance reserves totaling million and million  respectively  are included on our balance sheet 
these amounts represent our best estimate of our ultimate obligations for asserted claims  insurance premium obligations  and claims incurred but not yet reported at the balance sheet dates 
we establish specific reserves for claims using a case by case evaluation of the underlying claim data and update our evaluations as further information becomes known 
judgments and assumptions are inherent in our reserve accruals  as a result  changes in assumptions or claims experience could result in changes to these estimates in the future 
additionally  the actual results of claim settlements could differ from the amounts estimated 
goodwill goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized and are tested at least annually for impairment 
we perform our annual analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and in any other period in which indicators of impairment warrant an additional analysis 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
goodwill is evaluated for impairment by first comparing management s estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
reporting units for purposes of goodwill impairment calculations are our reportable segments 
management utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the estimated fair value of our reporting units 
significant judgments and assumptions including the discount rate  anticipated revenue growth and gross margins  estimated operating and interest expense  and capital expenditures are inherent in these fair value estimates which are based on our internal operating budgets 
as a result  actual results may differ from the estimates utilized in our discounted cash flow analysis 
the use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could result in a fair value that differs from our estimate and could result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the financial statements 
as a result of these uncertainties  we utilize multiple scenarios and assign probabilities to each of the scenarios in the discounted cash flow analysis 
the results of the discounted cash flow analysis are then compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a computation of the implied fair value of goodwill is compared with its related carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in the amount of the excess 
if an impairment charge is incurred  it would negatively impact our results of operations and financial position 

table of contents we did not record a goodwill impairment for either our construction services or repair and maintenance services segments in the three year period ended may  however  we did record an impairment charge of million in fiscal due to declines in operating results at that time and significant contract disputes 
although we do not anticipate a future impairment charge  certain events could occur that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill 
such events could include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions  a significant change in the project plans of our customers  the economic condition of the customers and industries we serve  and a material negative change in the relationships with one or more of our significant customers 
if our judgments and assumptions change as a result of the occurrence of any of these events or other events that we do not currently anticipate  our expectations as to future results and our estimate of the implied value of one or more of our reporting units also may change 
we define headroom as the percentage difference between each segments carrying value and fair value 
at may   headroom for the construction services segment was and headroom for the repair and maintenance services segment was 
our significant assumptions  including revenue growth  gross margins  operating and interest expense and other factors  have been reasonably accurate in recent years  but are likely to change in light of the dynamic competitive environment in which we operate 
assuming that all other components of our fair value estimate remain unchanged  a change in the following assumptions would have the following effect on headroom if the growth rate of estimated revenue decreases one percent from current estimates  headroom for the construction services segment would be reduced from to and headroom for the repair and maintenance services segment would be reduced from to  if assumed gross margins decrease one percent  headroom for the construction services segment would be reduced from to and headroom for the repair and maintenance services segment would be reduced from to  and if the applicable discount rate increases one percent  headroom for the construction services segment would be decreased from to and headroom for the repair and maintenance services segment would be reduced from to

table of contents results of operations overview the company has two reportable segments  construction services and repair and maintenance services 
the majority of the work for both segments is performed in the united states with less than of revenues generated in canada during fiscal however  the company does continue to seek opportunities for growth in both the domestic and international markets 
the primary services of our construction services segment are aboveground storage tanks for the bulk storage terminal industry  capital construction for the downstream petroleum industry  specialty construction  and electrical instrumentation services for various industries 
these services  including civil structural  mechanical  piping  electrical and instrumentation  millwrighting  and fabrication  are provided for projects of varying complexities  schedule durations  and budgets 
our project experience includes renovations  retrofits  modifications and expansions to existing facilities as well as construction of new facilities 
the primary services of our repair and maintenance services segment are aboveground storage tank repair and maintenance services including tank inspection  cleaning and asme code repairs  planned major and routine maintenance for the downstream petroleum industry  specialty repair and maintenance services and electrical and instrumentation repair and maintenance 
significant fluctuations in revenues  gross profits and operating results are discussed below on a consolidated basis and for each segment 
revenues fluctuate due to many factors  including the changing product mix and project schedules  which are dependent on the level and timing of customer releases of new business 
fiscal year versus consolidated consolidated revenues were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from consolidated revenues of million for fiscal the improvement in consolidated revenues resulted from increases of million in construction services revenues and million in repair and maintenance services revenues 
consolidated gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the improvement of million  or was primarily due to revenue growth of million 
consolidated gross margins were unchanged at for both fiscal years despite an improvement in the repair and maintenance services segment  where the gross margin grew to in the current fiscal year versus in the prior fiscal year 
offsetting this improvement was a decline in the construction services segment s gross margin  which was in fiscal versus in fiscal consolidated sg a expenses increased million  or  in fiscal to million from million for fiscal the increase was primarily caused by higher employee related expenses and facility costs resulting from the cost of additional hires and related benefits to meet the demands of current and anticipated growth and a bad debt charge caused by the bankruptcy of a customer that is involved in a contract dispute with the company 
sg a expense as a percentage of revenue increased to in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year as the benefit from the growth in revenues was more than offset by the increase in sg a expenses 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline of million was primarily due to the fiscal conversion to common stock of million of convertible notes and lower amortization of debt issuance costs 
current year interest expense was primarily related to the amortization of deal fees on the senior revolving credit facility and interest on short term borrowings under this facility 
income before income tax expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this million increase occurred due to higher gross profits and lower interest expense  partially offset by higher sg a expenses 

table of contents the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
the fiscal tax rate was reduced due to a tax benefit of million resulting from the continuing assessment of the realizability of state investment tax credits and other miscellaneous deductions 
the fiscal rate was favorably impacted by the utilization of losses on disputed contracts  the tax benefits of which had been reserved as a valuation allowance in previous years 
net income for fiscal grew to million  or per fully diluted share  versus net income in fiscal of million  or per fully diluted share 
construction services revenues for the construction services segment were million  compared with million in the same period a year earlier 
the increase of million  or  was primarily due to higher aboveground storage tank revenues  which increased to million in fiscal  versus million a year earlier 
the increase was also driven by higher revenues in downstream petroleum  which increased to million in fiscal  versus million a year earlier  and by higher specialty revenues  which increased to million in fiscal compared to million a year earlier 
these increases were partially offset by lower electrical and instrumentation revenues  which fell million 
at may   the construction services segment had a backlog of million  as compared to a backlog of million as of may  the decrease of million is due to declines in specialty of million and downstream petroleum of million  partially offset by increases in aboveground storage tank and electrical and instrumentation of and million  respectively 
the decline in specialty backlog was attributable to the completion of a major lng construction project in the gulf coast region 
gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal due largely to the growth in revenues offset partially by reduced gross margins  which fell from in fiscal to in fiscal the gross profit improvement of million occurred despite fiscal results including million in pre tax charges for cost overruns related to an lng construction project in the gulf coast region 
in comparison  fiscal results included pre tax charges of million for this same lng construction project 
the remaining construction services projects experienced higher margins in fiscal than those recognized in the prior fiscal year 
operating income and income before income tax expense were million and million in fiscal compared to million and million in fiscal repair and maintenance services revenues for repair and maintenance services were million in fiscal versus million in fiscal the change was due to higher aboveground storage tank revenues  which improved to million  versus million last fiscal year 
this increase was largely offset by lower downstream petroleum revenues  which fell to million in fiscal  from million in the prior fiscal year  and lower electrical and instrumentation revenues  which dropped million to million in fiscal from million during fiscal backlog at may  and may  for the repair and maintenance services segment was million and million  respectively 
the increase of million was due to increases in downstream petroleum of million  aboveground storage tank of million and electrical and instrumentation of million 
despite relatively flat year over year revenues  gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and gross margins improved from during fiscal to in fiscal repair and maintenance services gross margins for fiscal benefited from high levels of customer call out work and strong markets  particularly in aboveground storage tank 
operating income and income before income tax expense increased to million and million  respectively  in fiscal compared to million and million in fiscal 
table of contents fiscal year versus consolidated consolidated revenues were in fiscal  an increase of million  or  from consolidated revenues of million in fiscal this large improvement in consolidated revenues resulted from an increase of million in construction services revenues combined with growth of million in repair and maintenance services revenues 
consolidated gross profit increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this improvement of million  or  was due to the growth in revenues combined with greater margins contributed by the repair and maintenance services segment 
consolidated gross margins grew from in fiscal to in fiscal due to an improvement in the repair and maintenance services segment  which grew to in the current fiscal year versus in the prior fiscal year 
this improvement stemmed from effective project execution  more efficient absorption of fixed costs due to the larger revenue base and a continued focus by the company on managing its contractual risks 
in addition  margins were further enhanced by a favorable market and an expanding backlog which allowed matrix service to be more selective in its process of procuring projects 
partially offsetting these improvements was a pre tax charge in fiscal of million  or per fully diluted share  resulting from continued cost escalations on a lng construction project in the gulf coast region 
consolidated sg a expenses were million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase of million was primarily due to employee related expenses resulting from additional staff hired throughout fiscal to support our growth combined with additional expense of million related to the fair value recognition provisions in sfas r  share based payment 
partially offsetting this increase was a decline in legal costs of approximately million as the company settled all but one of its significant contract disputes and lower restructuring costs 
sg a expense as a percentage of revenue fell to in fiscal compared to in the prior fiscal year as the growth in revenues more than offset the increase in sg a expenses 
interest expense declined to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this sharp decline of million was primarily due to reduced debt outstanding during the year 
current year interest expense was primarily related to the amortization of prepaid interest and fees on the convertible notes  amortization of deal fees on the senior credit facility  and interest on short term borrowings under the revolving facility 
other income in fiscal of million resulted from gains on the sale of assets identified during the restructuring effort 
other income in fiscal of million consisted of miscellaneous non operating items 
income before income tax expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this million improvement was due to higher gross profit combined with decreased interest expense 
partially offsetting this improvement was higher sg a expense in fiscal along with gains on the sale of assets included in fiscal results 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were and  respectively 
both fiscal and fiscal benefited from the tax recognition of losses on disputed contracts 
in fiscal  certain operating loss carryforwards previously reserved were utilized or deemed to be fully utilizable resulting in a benefit of million 
in fiscal  approximately million of previously established valuation allowances were reversed upon the utilization of the related operating loss carryforwards 
net income for fiscal rose to million  or per fully diluted share  versus net income in fiscal of million  or per fully diluted share 

table of contents construction services revenues for the construction services segment rose significantly from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  which represents an increase of million  or 
this improvement was primarily due to aboveground storage tank revenues increasing million  but improvements were also seen throughout the segment as downstream petroleum revenues rose million  specialty revenues grew million and electrical and instrumentation revenues climbed million 
the substantial growth in the aboveground storage tank revenues was driven by the strength of the market and capital spending from our core customer base 
the growth in downstream petroleum revenues was primarily due to the performance of work for two additional refinery customers  while the growth in specialty revenues was primarily related to the lng construction project 
backlog increased from million at may  to million at may  a change in the method used to calculate backlog that led to the inclusion of time and material contracts that had been previously excluded accounted for million of the increase  the remaining increase was due to significant awards for the construction of aboveground storage tank capacity at new terminals and terminal expansions 
gross profit rose from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  an improvement of 
construction services gross margins declined from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease occurred due to a pre tax charge in fiscal of million on an lng construction project in the gulf coast region 
the charge was a result of a difficult post katrina labor environment  unforeseen productivity challenges and complexity of design leading to material and equipment cost increases 
in addition  weather continued to affect this lump sum project resulting in a more compressed schedule 
the loss recognized in fiscal reflected our best forecast of costs required to achieve our customer s schedule on the of the work remaining to be completed at may  operating income and income before income tax expense increased to million and million  respectively  in fiscal from operating income and income before income tax expense of million and million in fiscal  respectively 
this significant improvement was the result of additional revenues  combined with lower interest expense 
repair and maintenance services revenues from the repair and maintenance services segment grew million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this improvement resulted primarily from increases in aboveground storage tank revenues of million and electrical and instrumentation revenues of million 
partially offsetting this growth was a reduction in downstream petroleum revenues of million as turnaround work that occurred in fiscal was not fully replaced in fiscal repair and maintenance services backlog increased from million at may  to million at may   an increase of million or 
an increase of million was driven by leveraging our ast construction customers  resulting in new and additional ast repair and maintenance projects 
the remaining increase was due to a change in the method used to calculate backlog that led to the inclusion of time and material contracts that had previously been excluded 
gross margins improved to in fiscal as compared to gross margins of in fiscal primarily as the result of more effective project execution and higher revenue volumes relative to the segment s overall fixed cost structure 
gross profit also improved from million in fiscal to million in fiscal operating income and income before income tax expense climbed to million and million  respectively  in fiscal compared to million and million produced in fiscal this improvement was primarily due to higher revenues and margins combined with reduced interest expense 

table of contents non gaap financial measure ebitda is a supplemental  non gaap financial measure 
ebitda is defined as earnings before net interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we have presented ebitda because it is used by the financial community as a method of measuring our performance and of evaluating the market value of companies considered to be in similar businesses 
we believe that the line item on our consolidated statements of income entitled net income is the most directly comparable gaap measure to ebitda 
since ebitda is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap  it should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for  net earnings as an indicator of operating performance 
ebitda  as we calculate it  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies 
in addition  this measure is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs 
as ebitda excludes certain financial information compared with net income  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  users of this financial information should consider the type of events and transactions  which are excluded 
our non gaap performance measure  ebitda  has certain material limitations as follows it does not include interest income or expense 
because we have borrowed money to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary and ongoing part of our costs and has assisted us in generating revenue 
therefore  any measure that excludes interest expense has material limitations 
it does not include income taxes 
because the payment of income taxes is a necessary and ongoing part of our operations  any measure that excludes income taxes has material limitations 
it does not include depreciation expense 
because we use capital assets to generate revenue  depreciation expense is a necessary element of our cost structure 
therefore  any measure that excludes depreciation expense has material limitations 
a reconciliation of ebitda to net income follows fiscal year ended may  in thousands net income interest expense  net provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda outlook we expect the strong demand for our core services in the energy market to continue into fiscal we are focused on diversifying our service offerings and expanding our geographic footprint within the energy and industrial markets 
by focusing on project execution  customer service and diversification  we believe that we are well positioned to build upon our recent growth and expect record revenues and net income in fiscal 
table of contents financial condition and liquidity overview we define liquidity as the ongoing ability to pay our liabilities as they become due  fund business operations and meet all monetary contractual obligations 
our primary sources of liquidity in fiscal were cash flows from operations and borrowings under our senior revolving credit facility 
cash on hand at may  totaled million and availability under the senior revolving credit facility totaled million  resulting in total liquidity of million 
factors that routinely impact our short term liquidity and may impact our long term liquidity include  but are not limited to changes in working capital contract terms that determine the timing of billings to customers and the collection of those billings some cost plus and fixed price customer contracts are billed based on milestones which may require us to incur significant expenditures prior to collections from our customers 
time and material contracts are normally billed in arrears 
therefore  we are required to carry these costs until they can be billed and collected 
some of our large construction projects require retentions 
capital expenditures strategic investments in new operations acquisitions of new businesses purchases of shares under our existing or any future stock buyback program contract disputes or collection issues resulting from the failure of a significant customer in the future  we may elect to increase the revolving credit facility or raise additional capital by issuing common stock  convertible notes or term debt as necessary to fund our operations 
in fiscal  we expect cash flows from operations to be a significant source of liquidity  which we expect will provide funding for additional investments in capital assets 
we will continue to evaluate our working capital requirements and other factors to maintain sufficient liquidity 
cash flows from operating activities operations generated million of cash in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the million increase in cash generated from operations was due primarily to a favorable change in operating assets and liabilities of million in fiscal  compared to an unfavorable change of million in fiscal also contributing to the increase was a million increase in net income and an increase in non cash charges of million 
cash flows from investing activities investing activities used million of cash in fiscal due to capital expenditures of million partially offset by proceeds from asset sales of million 
fiscal capital expenditures were related to the replacement of existing assets  the support of growth in our business and facility expansions 
expenditures totaled million for the purchase of construction equipment  million for transportation equipment  million for furniture and fixtures  and million for land and buildings 
assets acquired through capital leases totaled million in fiscal and are reported as non cash additions to property  plant and equipment in the consolidated statement of cash flows 

table of contents our board of directors has approved a capital budget of million for fiscal capital required to complete projects in progress at may  totaled million  or of the capital budget 
capital to replace  repair or maintain equipment is million  or of the capital budget 
we expect to invest million  or of the capital budget in new assets to increase fabrication capacity and to equip additional construction and maintenance crews in targeted growth markets 
the remaining million  or of the capital budget is to purchase  expand or improve facilities to address the company s need for additional office and shop space 
cash flows from financing activities financing activities used million of cash in fiscal this was primarily due to open market purchases of treasury shares of million  payments on the acquisition note of million  and capital lease payments of million  partially offset by the net proceeds received from stock option and deferred share activity of million 
senior revolving credit facility the senior revolving credit facility is primarily used to fund short term changes in working capital and issuance of letters of credit 
the total capacity of the facility at may  was million with million outstanding for letters of credit that have been issued to support certain workers compensation insurance programs 
the facility contains provisions that allow us to increase the capacity to million  with the approval of the administrative agent 
the company currently believes that sufficient liquidity exists but may seek approval to increase the facility to million in the future if considered necessary 
we believe the senior credit facility provides adequate liquidity and financial flexibility to support our expected growth in fiscal and beyond 
the facility contains customary negative covenants including limits on other indebtedness  operating and capital lease obligations  asset sales  dividends and certain other distributions 
the facility also contains financial covenants that require us to maintain certain financial ratios  including a senior leverage ratio  an asset coverage ratio  a fixed charge coverage ratio and a tangible net worth requirement 
non compliance with any of these ratios or a violation of other covenants could result in an event of default and reduce availability under the facility 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants and have full availability under the facility 
convertible notes convertible notes with a principal balance of million  were issued through a private placement transaction on april  the notes were convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
in fiscal  million of the convertible notes were converted into  shares of our common stock 
the remaining million of notes were converted into  shares of our common stock in fiscal acquisition payable as part of an acquisition in fiscal  we deferred a portion of the purchase price to be paid in annual installments over five years 
the final payment of million was due in fiscal on march   we paid million to the seller 
an additional was paid on behalf of the seller to certain taxing authorities  the remaining million will be paid either to or on behalf of the seller to the taxing authorities after final resolution of certain disputed sales and use tax obligations 
dividend policy we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock  and the terms of our credit agreement limits the amount of cash dividends we can pay 
we currently intend to retain earnings to finance the growth of our business 
any payment of cash dividends in the future will depend upon our financial condition  capital requirements and earnings as well as other factors the board of directors may deem relevant 

table of contents treasury shares in october  the board of directors authorized a stock buyback program  which permitted the purchase of up to ie   shares of our common stock outstanding at that time 
to date  matrix service has purchased  shares under the program and has authorization to purchase an additional  shares 
in fiscal  the company purchased  shares at an average price of 
in addition to the stock buyback program  matrix service may withhold shares of common stock to satisfy the tax withholding obligation upon vesting of an employee s deferred shares 
the company withheld  shares of common stock during fiscal for the obligation 
in addition to shares that may be repurchased in conjunction with the future issuance of deferred shares  matrix service has and may continue to repurchase shares under the stock buyback program if the company determines the purchase is accretive to earnings per share 
the company has  treasury shares remaining as of may  and intends to utilize these treasury shares solely for the satisfaction of stock issuances under the company s stock plans 
commitments as of may   the following commitments were in place to support our ordinary course obligations commitments by expiration period less than year years years more than years total in thousands letters of credit surety bonds total commitments all letters of credit are in support of our workers compensation insurance programs 
the letters of credit are secured by our senior credit facility and are expected to renew annually through the term of the credit facility  therefore  they are reported in the same period that the credit facility expires 
contractual obligations at may  are summarized below contractual obligations by expiration period less than year years years more than years total in thousands operating leases capital lease obligations acquisition payable total contractual obligations 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our interest rate risk results primarily from our variable rate indebtedness under our senior credit facility  which is influenced by movements in short term rates 
borrowings under our million revolving credit facility are based on an alternate base rate or one  two  three or six month libor as elected by the company plus an additional margin based on our senior leverage ratio 
although there were no amounts outstanding under the facility at may   we do routinely borrow against our revolving credit line to fund short term working capital needs 
we do not currently utilize interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate risk  therefore  short term interest rates could have an impact on future interest expense 
financial instruments with interest rate risk at may  were as follows maturity by fiscal year total fair value as of may  in thousands long term debt variable rate debt acquisition payable there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior credit facility at may  in fiscal  the weighted average interest rate on our borrowings under our senior credit facility was 
at the company s option  amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility will bear interest at libor or an alternate base rate  plus in each case  an additional margin based on the senior leverage ratio 
the alternate base rate is the greater of the prime rate or the fed funds effective rate plus 
the additional margin ranges from to on alternate base rate borrowings and from to on libor based borrowings
