some of the accounting policies require it to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most critical accounting estimates include the valuation of accounts receivable and inventory 
the company reviews its accounts receivable portfolio frequently  assessing any past due accounts for collectability 
physical inventories are conducted at each of the company s manufacturing facilities at least quarterly  and inventories are assessed for any slow moving or obsolete items  which constitutes the main judgment necessary in valuing the inventory 
reserves for both receivables and inventory are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as required
