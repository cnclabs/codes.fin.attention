item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this report 
at december   our cash and cash equivalent balance was approximately million and our credit facility had a zero balance 
all of our cash equivalents are currently invested in money market mutual funds  short term time deposits  and government agency and corporate obligations  the income of which generally increases or decreases in proportion to increases or decreases  respectively  in interest rates 
we do not believe that changes in interest rates have had a material impact on us in the past or are likely to have a material impact on us in the foreseeable future 
for example  a change of basis points in the interest rate on either our investments or any future reasonably likely borrowings would not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
commodity price risk 
from time to time we are subject to market risk from fluctuating commodity prices in certain raw materials we use 
to date  we have managed this risk by using alternative raw materials acceptable to our customers or we have been able to pass these cost increases to our customers 
we do not believe that changes in commodity prices have had a material impact on us in the past or are likely to have a material impact on us in the foreseeable future 
foreign exchange risk 
since substantially all of our revenues  expenses and capital spending are transacted in us dollars  we are not exposed to significant foreign exchange risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage or hedge our exposure to interest rate changes or other market risks  or for trading or other speculative purposes
