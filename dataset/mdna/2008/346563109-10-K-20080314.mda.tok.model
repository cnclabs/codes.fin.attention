item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we derive revenues from memberships to our research products and from our advisory services and events available through what we refer to as research  data  consulting  and community offerings 
we offer contracts for our research products that are typically renewable annually and payable in advance 
research revenues are recognized as revenue ratably over the term of the contract 
accordingly  a substantial portion of our billings are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
clients purchase advisory services offered through our data  consulting and community products and services to supplement their memberships to our research 
billings attributable to advisory services are initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue when the services are performed 
event billings are also initially recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as revenue upon completion of each event 
consequently  changes in the number and value of client contracts  both net decreases as well as net increases  impact our revenues and other results over the terms of the contracts 
our primary operating expenses consist of cost of services and fulfillment  selling and marketing expenses  general and administrative expenses  depreciation  and amortization of intangible assets 
cost of services and fulfillment represents the costs associated with the production and delivery of our products and services  and it includes compensation for research personnel including non cash stock based compensation expense  and all associated editorial  travel  and support services 
selling and marketing expenses include salaries  bonuses  employee benefits  non cash stock based compensation expense  travel expenses  promotional costs  sales commissions  and other costs incurred in marketing and selling our products and services 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of the technology  operations  finance  and strategy groups and our other administrative functions  including salaries  bonuses  employee benefits  and non cash stock based compensation expense 
overhead costs are allocated over these categories according to the number of employees in each group 
amortization of intangible assets represents the cost of amortizing acquired intangible assets such as customer relationships 
deferred revenue  agreement value  client retention  dollar retention and enrichment are metrics we believe are important to understanding our business 
we believe that the amount of deferred revenue  along with the agreement value of contracts to purchase research and advisory services  provide a significant measure of our business activity 
deferred revenue reflects billings in advance of revenue recognition as of the measurement date 
we calculate agreement value as the total revenues recognizable from all research and advisory service contracts in force at a given time but not including advisory only contracts  without regard to how much revenue has already been recognized 
no single client accounted for more than of agreement value at december  we calculate client retention as the number of client companies who renewed with memberships during the most recent twelve month period as a percentage of those that would have expired during the same period 
we calculate dollar retention as a percentage of the dollar value of all client membership contracts renewed during the most recent twelve month period to the total dollar value of all client membership contracts that expired during the period 
we calculate enrichment as a percentage of the dollar value of client membership contracts renewed during the period to the dollar value of the corresponding expiring contracts 
client retention  dollar retention  and enrichment are not necessarily indicative of the rate of future retention of our revenue base 
a summary of our key metrics is as follows absolute percentage year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease deferred revenue in millions at year end agreement value in millions at year end client retention dollar retention enrichment number of clients at year end absolute percentage year ended december  increase increase decrease decrease deferred revenue in millions at year end agreement value in millions at year end client retention dollar retention enrichment number of clients at year end the increase in deferred revenue and agreement value from to is primarily due to increases in the number of clients and in the average contract size 
the average contract for annual memberships for research only in force at december  was approximately  an increase of from  at december  the average contract for an annual membership for research which also included advisory services in force at december  was approximately  an increase of from  at december  the increase in average contract size is due to an increased demand for our products 
the client retention decrease reflects a greater proportion of new business contracts in than previously experienced  which historically  and in  have renewed at lower rates 
the decrease in client retention as well as in enrichment also reflects lower than historical renewal and enrichment rates in europe and asia pacific due in part to organizational re alignment 
the increase in deferred revenue and agreement value from to is primarily due to increases in the number of clients and in the average contract size 
the average contract for annual memberships for research only in force at december  was approximately  an increase of from  at december  the average contract for an annual membership for research which also included advisory services in force at december  was approximately  an increase of from  at december  increases in average contract sizes and enrichment in reflect increasing demand for our products  reduced discounting and increased prices 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our policies and estimates  including but not limited to  those related to our revenue recognition  non cash stock based compensation  allowance for doubtful accounts  non marketable investments  goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be those that require the most subjective judgment or those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
this is not a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
for a discussion of our other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f revenue recognition 
we generate revenues from licensing our research  performing advisory services  hosting events and conducting teleconferences 
we execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each arrangement 
revenues from contracts that contain multiple deliverables are allocated among the separate units based on their relative fair values  however  the amount recognized is limited to the amount that is not contingent on future performance conditions 
research service revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
advisory service revenues are recognized during the period in which the customer receives the agreed upon deliverable 
forrester teleconferences revenue and reimbursed out of pocket expenses are recorded as advisory service revenues 
events revenues are recognized upon completion of the event 
annual memberships which include access to our research  unlimited phone or email analyst inquiry  unlimited participation in forrester s teleconferences  and the right to attend one event  are accounted for as one unit of accounting and recognized ratably as research services revenue over the membership period 
while historical business practice had been to offer contracts with a non cancelable term  effective april   we began offering clients a money back guarantee  which gives clients the right to cancel their membership contracts prior to the end of the contract term 
for contracts that can be terminated during the contract term  refunds would be issued for unused products or services 
furthermore  our revenue recognition determines the timing of commission expenses  which are deferred and then recorded as expense as the related revenue is recognized 
we evaluate the recoverability of deferred commissions at each balance sheet date 
non cash stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation in net income 
to determine the fair value of stock based compensation  sfas no 
r requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives and forfeiture rates 
the company will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
the development of an expected life assumption involves projecting employee exercise behaviors expected period between stock option vesting date and stock option exercise dates 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the actual stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
prior to sfas no 
r adoption  we accounted for share based payments under apb no 
apb requires the company to determine the appropriate measurement date for purposes of calculating non cash stock based compensation expense 
the use of different measurement dates may have resulted in more or less compensation expense to the company 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make contractually obligated payments 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  management makes judgments regarding the collectibility of accounts receivable by specifically analyzing historical bad debts  customer concentrations  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and if the financial condition of our customers were to improve  the allowances may be reduced accordingly 
non marketable investments 
we hold minority interests in technology related companies and equity investment funds 
these investments are in companies that are not publicly traded  and  therefore  because no established market for these securities exists  the estimate of the fair value of our investments requires significant judgment 
we have a policy in place to review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate the carrying value of the investments in these companies  which consists primarily of reviewing the investee s revenue and earnings trends relative to predefined milestones and overall business prospects 
we record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill and intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we have goodwill and identified intangible assets with finite lives related to our acquisitions 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be measured for impairment at least annually or whenever events indicate that there may be an impairment 
in order to determine if an impairment exists  we compare the reporting unit s carrying value to the reporting unit s fair value 
determining the reporting unit s fair value requires us to make estimates on market conditions and operational performance 
absent an event that indicates a specific impairment may exist  we have selected november th as the date of performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
intangible assets with finite lives consist of acquired customer relationships  research content and trademarks and are valued according to the future cash flows they are estimated to produce 
these assigned values are amortized on an accelerated basis which matches the periods in which those cash flows are estimated to be produced 
tangible assets with finite lives consist of property and equipment  which are depreciated and amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that the estimated remaining useful life of our identifiable intangible and long lived tangible assets may warrant revision or that the carrying value of these assets may be impaired 
to compute whether intangible assets have been impaired  the estimated undiscounted future cash flows for the estimated remaining useful life of the assets are compared to the carrying value 
to the extent that the future cash flows are less than the carrying value  the assets are written down to the estimated fair value of the asset 
income taxes 
we have deferred tax assets related to temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as operating loss carryforwards primarily from stock option exercises and the acquisition of giga information group  inc in 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible and before the carryforwards expire 
although realization is not assured  based upon the level of our historical taxable income and projections for our future taxable income over the periods during which the deferred tax assets are deductible and the carryforwards expire  management believes it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deferred tax assets 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if our estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward periods are incorrect 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas statement no 
 fin which seeks to reduce the significant diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  upon adoption  the cumulative effect of any changes in net assets resulting from the application of fin was recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings 
we adopted fin in the first quarter of and the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
valuation and impairment of available for sale securities 
the fair value of our available for sale securities is generally determined from quoted market prices received from pricing services based upon market transactions at fair value 
we also have investments in auction rate securities collateralized by student loans and municipal debt 
the company s auction rate securities are recorded at cost  which approximate fair market value due to their variable interest rates  which typically reset through an auction process every seven to thirty five days 
this auction mechanism generally allows existing investors to roll over their holdings and continue to own their securities or liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par value 
because of these short intervals between interest reset dates  we monitor the auctions to ensure they are successful  which provides evidence that these investments that are carried at par value approximates their fair value 
to the extent an auction were to fail and the securities were not liquid  we would need to seek other alternatives to determine the fair value of these securities  which may not be based on quoted market transactions 
we did not need to seek alternative methods of valuation for our auction rate securities held as of december   as all of our auction rate securities had successful auctions up to december  as well as in january discontinued operations on september   we completed the sale of our ultimate consumer panel ucp product line to lightspeed online research  inc for million in cash  of which million was paid at the closing date subject to a working capital adjustment  with the remainder paid nine months after the closing date 
the sale resulted in a gain on the disposal net of million of income tax expense of million 
the sale included the transfer of certain assets  including all ucp customer contracts  historical data  intellectual property  six employees  and licenses as well as certain liabilities arising in the normal course of business 
forrester sold the product line as it was no longer a strategic fit with its core focus on broad  global business and consumer technology data 
the ucp product line had gross revenues for the years and of million and million  respectively 
net income from the discontinued operations was  net of  of income tax expense for the year ended december   and net loss from the discontinued operations was  net of  of income tax benefit for the year ended december  the financial results of the ucp product line are reported as a single line item of loss income from discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the gross revenue and net income numbers noted above for ucp for only include amounts recorded through september  as ucp was disposed of on that date 
results of operations for the years ended december   and the following table sets forth selected financial data as a percentage of total revenues for the years noted

results of quarterly operations the following tables set forth a summary of our unaudited quarterly operating results for each of our eight most recently ended fiscal quarters 
we have derived this information from our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements  which  in the opinion of our management  have been prepared on a basis consistent with our financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
historically  our total revenues  operating profit  and net income in the fourth quarter have reflected the significant positive contribution of revenues attributable to advisory services performed 
as a result  we have historically experienced a decline in total revenues  operating profit  and net income from the quarter ended december to the quarter ended march our quarterly operating results are not necessarily indicative of future results of operations

memberships for research services  which constituted approximately of our revenues during  are annually renewable and are generally payable in advance 
we generated cash from operating activities of million during and million during the decrease in cash provided by operating activities is primarily attributable to a decrease in accrued expenses 
we used cash in investing activities of million during and million during the decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily attributable to a decrease in net purchases of available for sale securities 
we regularly invest excess funds in short and intermediate term interest bearing obligations of investment grade 
in june  we committed to invest million in two technology related private equity investment funds over an expected period of five years 
as of december   we had contributed approximately million to the funds 
the timing and amount of future contributions are entirely within the discretion of the investment funds 
in july  we adopted a cash bonus plan to pay bonuses  after the return of invested capital  measured by the proceeds of a portion of the share of net profits from these investments  if any  to certain key employees who must remain employed with us at the time any bonuses become payable under the plan  subject to the terms and conditions of the plan 
the principal purpose of this cash bonus plan was to retain key employees by allowing them to participate in a portion of the potential return from forrester s technology related investments if they remained employed by the company 
the plan was established at a time when technology and internet companies were growing significantly  and providing incentives to retain key employees during that time was important 
to date  we have not paid any bonuses under this plan 
in december  we committed to invest an additional million over an expected period of two years in an annex fund of one of the two private equity investment funds 
as of december   we had contributed million to the annex fund 
we generated million in cash from financing activities during and generated million during the decrease in cash from financing activities is primarily attributable to a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
in february  our board of directors authorized an additional million to purchase common stock under the existing stock repurchase program and in october  our board of directors authorized a further million to purchase common stock under the stock repurchase program 
during and  we repurchased  and  shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had cumulatively repurchased approximately million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
in february  certain auction rate securities ars that we hold experienced failed auctions that limited the liquidity of these securities 
based on current market conditions  it is likely that auction failures will continue that could result in either temporary or other than temporary impairments of our ars holdings  which totalled million of which million have failed as of february  the company has the ability and intent to hold these securities until a successful auction occurs and the arss are liquidated at par value 
if in the future we determine that any decline in value of the arss is other than temporary  we would have to recognize the loss in our statement of operations  which could have a material impact on our operating results in the period it is recognized 
further  as the funds associated with the arss may not be accessible for in excess of twelve months because of continued failed auctions or our inability to find a buyer outside of the auction process  we may classify these securities as long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of march   or thereafter 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and available for sale securities of million 
we do not have a line of credit and do not anticipate the need for one in the foreseeable future 
we plan to continue to introduce new products and services and expect to make the requisite investments in our infrastructure during the next months 
we believe that our current cash balance  available for sale securities  and cash flows from operations will satisfy working capital  financing activities  and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next two years 
as of december   we had future contractual obligations as follows for operating leases contractual future payments by year obligations total thereafter in thousands operating leases the above table does not include future minimum rentals to be received under subleases of  the above table also does not include the remaining  of capital commitments to the private equity funds described above due to the uncertainty and timing of capital calls made by such funds to pay these capital commitments 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  however  on february   the fasb issued fsp fas which delays the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this fsp partially defers the effective date of statement to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
effective for  we will adopt sfas except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in fsp fas the partial adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the fasb s objective in this statement is to provide reporting entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we will be required to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal year we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas no 
and have not yet determined the impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
sfas no 
r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any controlling interest  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no 
r is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after an entity s fiscal year that begins after december  we have not completed our evaluation of the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of sfas no 
r on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
adoption is prospective and early adoption is not permitted 
adoption of sfas no 
r will not impact our accounting for business combinations closed prior to its adoption  but given the nature of the changes noted above  we expect our accounting for business combinations occurring subsequent to adoption will be significantly different than that applied following current accounting literature 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas no 

sfas no 
amends arb to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary by requiring all noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries be reported in the same way in the consolidated financial statements and eliminates the diversity in accounting for transactions between an entity and noncontrolling interests by requiring they be treated as equity transactions 
sfas no 
is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning after december  and may not be applied before that date 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including us government agencies  municipal notes which may have an auction reset feature  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper  and money market funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
all investments mature within approximately one year from the date of purchase 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity without giving effect to any future acquisitions or mergers 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
our available for sale securities portfolio  which totalled million at december   includes auction rate securities ars of million from various issuers collateralized by student loans and municipal debt 
arss are securities with long term contractual maturities but with interest rates that are reset every seven to thirty five days by auctions 
at the end of each reset period  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
during february  certain arss that we hold experienced failed auctions that limited the liquidity of these securities 
based on current market conditions  it is likely that auction failures will continue and could result in either temporary or other than temporary impairments of our ars holdings  which totalled million of which million had failed as of february  the million difference between the million of arss held at december  and the million held as of february   represents successful net sales of these securities at par value 
the company has the ability and intent to hold these securities until a successful auction occurs and the arss are liquidated at par value 
if in the future we determine that any decline in value of the arss is other than temporary  we would have to recognize the loss in our statement of income  which could have a material impact on our operating results in the period it is recognized 
further  as the funds associated with the arss may not be accessible for in excess of twelve months because of continued failed auctions or our inability to find a buyer outside of the auction process  we may classify these securities as long term assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of march   or thereafter

on a global level  we face exposure to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
to date  the effect of changes in currency exchange rates has not had a significant impact on our financial position or our results of operations 
accordingly  we have not entered into any hedging agreements 
however  we are prepared to hedge against fluctuations that the euro  or other foreign currencies  will have on foreign exchange exposure if this exposure becomes material 
as of december   the total assets  excluding goodwill and intangible assets  related to non us dollar denominated currencies were approximately million
