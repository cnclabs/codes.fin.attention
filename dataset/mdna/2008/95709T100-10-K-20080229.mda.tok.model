item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources capital resources for more information 
environmental matters general we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
environmental laws and regulations affecting power plants are overlapping  complex  and subject to changes in interpretation and implementation and have tended to become more stringent over time 
these laws and regulations relate primarily to discharges into the air  air quality  discharges of effluents into water  the use of water  and the handling  disposal and clean up of hazardous substances and wastes 
these laws and regulations require a lengthy and complex process for obtaining licenses  permits and approvals from governmental agencies for our new  existing or modified facilities 
if we fail to comply with such laws  regulations and permits  or fail to obtain and maintain necessary permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
certain of these costs are recoverable through the environmental cost recovery rider ecrr established by the kcc order  which allows for the timely inclusion in rates of capital investments related directly to environmental improvements required by the clean air act as well as many of the costs relating to compliance with other environmental laws and regulations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover all such costs from our customers or that our business  consolidated financial condition or results of operations will not be materially and adversely affected as a result of costs to comply with existing or future environmental laws and regulations 
air emissions the clean air act  state laws and implementing regulations impose  among other things  limitations on pollutants generated during our operations  including sulfur dioxide so  particulate matter and nitrogen oxides nox 

table of contents certain kansas department of health and environment kdhe regulations applicable to our generating facilities prohibit the emission of so in excess of prescribed levels 
in order to meet these standards  we use low sulfur coal  fuel oil and natural gas and have equipped our generating facilities with pollution control equipment 
in addition  we must comply with the provisions of the clean air act amendments of that require a two phase reduction in certain emissions 
we have installed continuous monitoring and reporting equipment in order to meet these requirements 
title iv of the clean air act created an so allowance and trading program as part of the federal acid rain program 
under the allowance and trading program  the environmental protection agency epa allocated annual so allowances for each affected emitting unit 
an so allowance is a limited authorization to emit one ton of so during a calendar year 
at the end of each year  each emitting unit must have enough allowances to cover its emissions for that year 
allowances are tradable so that operators of affected units that are anticipated to emit so in excess of their allowances may purchase allowances in the market in which such allowances are traded 
in  we had so allowances adequate to meet planned generation and we expect to have enough in in the future we may need to purchase additional allowances and as a result our operating costs may increase 
we expect to recover the cost of emission allowances through the reca although there are no guarantees we will be able to do so 
the price of emissions allowances is determined by market forces and changes over time 
on march   the epa issued the clean air mercury rule 
the rule caps permanently  and seeks to reduce  the amount of mercury that may be emitted from coal fired power plants 
the rule requires implementation of reductions in two phases  the first starting in we received an allocation of mercury emission allowances pursuant to the rule 
preliminary testing indicates that the expected allocation of allowances will be insufficient to allow us to operate our coal fired units in compliance with the first phase requirements of the rule 
if the allocated allowances are insufficient  we may need to purchase allowances in the market  install additional equipment or take other actions to reduce our mercury emissions 
however  on february   the us district court of appeals for the district of columbia vacated the clean air mercury rule 
while the ultimate impact of this ruling on our operations is currently unknown  we believe that mercury emissions controls may be required in the future and that the costs to comply with these requirements may be material 
on august  we filed an application with the kdhe to implement a plan to improve efficiency and to install new equipment to reduce regulated emissions from jeffrey energy center 
the projects outlined in a proposed agreement filed with the kdhe on august   are designed to meet requirements of the clean air visibility rule and reduce emissions of our entire generating fleet by eliminating more than of so and reducing nitrous oxides and particulates between and 
environmental requirements have been changing substantially 
accordingly  we may be required to further reduce emissions of presently regulated gases and substances  such as so  nox  particulate matter and mercury and we may be required to reduce or limit emissions of gases and substances not presently regulated eg  carbon dioxide co 
proposals and bills in those respects include the epa s national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter and ozone  additional legislation introduced in the past few years in congress requiring reductions of presently unregulated gases related primarily to concerns about climate change  and state legislation introduced recently that could require mitigation of co emissions 
based on currently available information  we cannot estimate our costs to comply with these proposed laws  but we believe such costs could be material 

table of contents environmental costs we have identified the potential for us to make up to billion of capital expenditures at our power plants for environmental air emissions projects described above during approximately the next eight to ten years 
this estimate could increase depending on the resolution of the epa new source review investigation nsr investigation described below 
in addition to the capital investment  in the event we install new equipment as a result of the nsr investigation  we anticipate that we would incur significant annual expense to operate and maintain the equipment and the operation of the equipment would reduce net production from our plants 
the degree to which we will need to reduce emissions and the timing of when such emissions controls may be required is uncertain 
both the timing and the nature of required investments depend on specific outcomes that result from interpretation of existing regulations  new regulations  legislation and the resolution of the nsr investigation described below 
in addition  the availability of equipment and contractors can affect the timing and ultimate cost of the equipment 
the ecrr allows for the timely inclusion in rates of capital expenditures tied directly to environmental improvements  including those required by the clean air act 
however  increased operating and maintenance costs other than expenses related to production related consumables can be recovered only through a change in base rates following a rate review 
new source review investigation under section a of the clean air act section  the epa is conducting investigations nationwide to determine whether modifications at coal fired power plants are subject to the new source review permitting program or new source performance standards 
these investigations focus on whether projects at coal fired plants were routine maintenance or whether the projects were substantial modifications that could reasonably have been expected to result in a significant net increase in emissions 
the new source review program requires companies to obtain permits and  if necessary  install control equipment to address emissions when making a major modification or a change in operation if either is expected to cause a significant net increase in emissions 
the epa requested information from us under section regarding projects and maintenance activities that have been conducted since at three coal fired plants we operate 
on january   the epa notified us that certain projects completed at jeffrey energy center violated certain requirements of the new source review program 
we have been in discussions with the epa and the department of justice doj concerning this matter in an attempt to reach a settlement 
we expect that any settlement could require us to update or install emissions controls at jeffrey energy center 
additionally  we might be required to update or install emissions controls at our other coal fired plants  pay fines or penalties  or take other remedial action 
if settlement discussions fail  doj may consider whether to pursue an enforcement action against us in federal district court 
our ultimate costs to resolve the nsr investigation could be material 
we believe that costs related to updating or installing emissions controls would qualify for recovery through the ecrr 
if  however  a penalty is assessed against us  the penalty could be material and may not be recovered in rates 
we are not able to estimate the possible loss or range of loss at this time 
manufactured gas sites we have been identified as being responsible for clean ups of a number of former manufactured gas sites located in kansas and missouri 
we and the kdhe entered into a consent agreement in governing all future work at the kansas sites 
under the terms of the consent agreement  we agreed to investigate and  if necessary  remediate these sites 
pursuant to an environmental indemnity agreement with oneok  the current owner of some of the sites  oneok assumed total liability for remediation of seven sites  and we share liability for remediation with oneok for five sites 
our total liability for the five shared sites is capped at million 
we have sole responsibility for remediation with respect to three sites 
our liability for the former manufactured gas sites identified in missouri is limited to million by the terms of an environmental indemnity agreement with the purchaser of our former missouri assets

table of contents item a 
risk factors like other companies in our industry  our consolidated financial results will be impacted by weather  the economy of our service territory and the energy use of our customers 
the value of our common stock and our creditworthiness will be affected by national and international macroeconomic trends  general market conditions and the expectations of the investment community  all of which are largely beyond our control 
in addition  the following statements highlight risk factors that may affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
these are not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all such risks  and the statements below must be read together with factors discussed elsewhere in this document and in our other filings with the sec 
our revenues depend upon rates determined by the kcc the kcc regulates many aspects of our business and operations  including the rates that we charge customers for retail electric service 
retail rates are set by the kcc using a cost of service approach that takes into account historical operating expenses  fixed obligations and recovery of and a return on capital investments 
using this approach  the kcc sets rates at a level calculated to recover such costs and a permitted return on investment 
other parties to a rate review or the kcc staff may contend that our rates are excessive 
effective january  the kcc authorized changes that left our base rates virtually unchanged but approved various changes to our rate structure that allow some adjustment to our prices 
the kcc approved the reca  which allows us to recover cost of fuel for generation and purchased power expense less margins earned on wholesale sales 
it also authorized us to implement the ecrr  which allows us to change our rates to reflect the impact of capital expenditures made to upgrade our equipment to environmental standards required by the clean air act 
our costs may not be fully recovered in retail rates except to the extent the kcc permits us to modify our prices by using specific adjustments and riders such as the reca and the ecrr  once established by the kcc  our rates generally remain fixed until changed in a subsequent rate review 
we may apply to change our rates or intervening parties may request that the kcc review our rates for possible adjustment  subject to any limitations that may have been ordered by the kcc 
equipment failures and other external factors can adversely affect our results the generation and transmission of electricity requires the use of expensive and complicated equipment 
while we have maintenance programs in place  generating plants are subject to unplanned outages because of equipment failure 
in these events  we must either produce replacement power from our other  usually less efficient  units or purchase power from others at unpredictable and potentially higher cost in order to meet our sales obligations 
in addition  equipment failure can limit our ability to make opportunistic sales to wholesale customers 
fuel deliveries can be interrupted or slowed and transmission systems may be constrained coal deliveries from the prb region of wyoming  the primary source for our coal  can be interrupted or can be slowed due to rail traffic congestion  equipment or track failure  or due to loading problems at the mines 
this may require that we implement coal conservation efforts and or take other compensating measures 
we experienced these problems and conserved coal to varying degrees in and these measures may include  but are not limited to  reducing coal consumption by revising normal dispatch of generation units  purchasing power or using more expensive power to serve customers and decreasing or  if necessary  eliminating opportunistic wholesale sales 
in addition  decisions or mistakes by other utilities may adversely affect our ability to use transmission lines to deliver or import power  thus subjecting us to unexpected expenses or to the cost and uncertainty of public policy initiatives 
these factors  along with the prices and price volatility of fuel and wholesale electricity are largely beyond our control 
costs that are not recovered through the reca could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated earnings  cash flows and financial position 
we engage in energy marketing transactions to reduce risk from market fluctuations  enhance system reliability and increase profits 
the events mentioned above could reduce our ability to participate in energy marketing opportunities  which could reduce our profits 

table of contents we may have material financial exposure relating to environmental matters on january   the epa notified us that certain projects completed at jeffrey energy center violated certain new source review permitting requirements under the clean air act 
this notification was delivered as part of an investigation by the epa regarding maintenance activities that have been conducted since at jeffrey energy center 
the costs to resolve this investigation  or any related enforcement action  could be material and could include fines and penalties as well as costs to install new emission control systems at jeffrey energy center and at certain of our other coal fired power plants 
our activities are subject to extensive and changing environmental regulation by federal  state  and local governmental authorities  particularly relating to air emissions 
in addition to laws currently in effect  numerous laws and regulations have been enacted and proposed relating to increasing national and international concern about possible global warming caused by the atmospheric release of co and other gases by industrial and other sources  including the utility industry 
on november   the governors of six midwestern states  including kansas  signed the midwest greenhouse gas reduction accord  under which the member states will  among other things  establish greenhouse gas reduction targets and develop a market based and multi sector cap and trade mechanism to help achieve such targets 
in addition  on october   the kdhe denied an application by an unrelated utility for an air quality permit for two new proposed coal generators in western kansas in part because of concerns about the increase in co and emissions and the potential ill effects those plants might have on the environment and health 
the kdhe noted that the decision constituted a first step in emerging policy to address existing and future co emissions in kansas 
the midwest greenhouse gas reduction accord or other new or changed laws and regulations  as well as third party litigation that may be brought against us or our competitors  could result in requirements to install costly equipment  increase our operating expense  reduce production from our plants or take other actions we are unable to identify at this time 
the degree to which we may need to reduce emissions and the timing of when such emissions control equipment may be required is uncertain 
both the timing and the nature of required investments depend on specific outcomes that result from interpretation of existing regulations  new regulations  legislation  and the resolution of the nsr investigation described above 
although we expect to recover in our rates most of the costs that we incur to comply with environmental regulations  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to fully and timely recover such costs or the costs of any failure to comply with laws and regulations 
failure to recover these associated costs could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting regulations unique to public utilities could change we currently apply the accounting principles of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  to our regulated business 
as of december   we had recorded million of regulatory assets  net of regulatory liabilities 
in the event we determined that we could no longer apply the principles of sfas no 
 either as i a result of the establishment of retail competition in our service territory  ii a change in the regulatory approach for setting rates from cost based ratemaking to another form of ratemaking  or iii other regulatory actions that restrict cost recovery to a level insufficient to recover costs  we would be required to record a charge against income in the amount of the remaining unamortized net regulatory assets 
such an action would materially reduce our shareholders equity 
we periodically review these criteria to ensure the continuing application of sfas no 
is appropriate 
based upon current evaluation of the various factors that are expected to impact future cost recovery  we believe that our regulatory assets are probable of recovery 

table of contents we face financial risks associated with wolf creek risks of substantial liability arise from the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities  including  among others  structural problems at a nuclear facility  the storage  handling and disposal of radioactive materials  limitations on the amounts and types of insurance coverage commercially available  uncertainties with respect to the cost and technological aspects of nuclear decommissioning at the end of their useful lives and costs or measures associated with public safety 
in the event of an extended or unscheduled outage at wolf creek  we would be required to generate power from more costly generating units  purchase power in the open market to replace the power normally produced at wolf creek and we would have less power available for sale into the wholesale markets 
if we were not permitted by the kcc to recover these costs  such events would likely have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition 
our planned capital expenditures are significant to our results of operations during the period from through and for the immediate years beyond  we plan to continue significant capital expenditures toward large projects including the expansion and modernization of our generation fleet and transmission network 
our anticipated capital expenditures for the period from through  including costs of removal  are approximately billion 
estimated costs for these capital projects have increased  in some cases significantly  as a result of rising demand for material  equipment and labor 
in addition  delays in engineering and construction times can occur throughout our industry 
because our capital expenditure program is large in comparison to our revenues and assets  cost increases or delays could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  in order to fund our capital expenditure program  we rely to a large degree on access to our short term credit facility and to long term capital markets for debt and equity as sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from our operations 
the secured debt of westar energy and kge is rated investment grade by all three of the best known rating agencies  and the unsecured debt of westar energy and kge is rated investment grade by two of the three best known rating agencies  but we cannot assure that such debt will continue to be rated investment grade 
if the rating agencies were to downgrade westar energy s or kge s secured or unsecured debt  our borrowing costs and the interest rates we pay on short term and long term debt would likely increase  possibly significantly 
further  market disruptions could increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access financial markets 
additional issuance of equity securities could dilute the value of our shares of our common stock and cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
these factors could hinder our access to capital markets and limit or delay our ability to carry out our capital expenditure program 
further  our recovery of capital expenditures depends in large degree on the outcome of retail and wholesale rate proceedings 
decisions made by the kcc or ferc  or delays in making such decisions  could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are the largest electric utility in kansas 
we produce  transmit and sell electricity at retail in kansas and at wholesale in a multi state region in the central united states under the regulation of the kcc and ferc 
in management s discussion and analysis  we discuss our general financial condition  significant changes that occurred during  and our operating results for the years ended december   and as you read management s discussion and analysis  please refer to our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes  which contain our operating results 
summary of significant items overview several significant items have impacted or may impact us and our operations since january  our gross margin for the year ended december   increased compared to the prior year due largely to increased wholesale sales 
see increased gross margin below for additional information  we estimate that we incurred approximately million in maintenance costs and capital expenditures to restore our electric distribution and transmission systems as a result of a severe ice storm that occurred in december we deferred million of these costs as a regulatory asset  which we will ask for recovery of in our next rate cases that are planned for  we issued million shares of common stock for net proceeds of million through sales agency financing agreements with bnycmi and a forward sale agreement and million in first mortgage bonds as part of our efforts to raise the capital needed to fund our construction projects 
we expect to continue to issue equity and debt as external funds are needed to complete planned capital investments  we started construction on a mw peaking power plant and are expanding our transmission network 
we also announced agreements with developers to build approximately mw of wind generation of which we will either own or enter into supply contracts related thereto 
see increased capacity and future plan below for additional information  changes in federal income tax law allowed us to recognize million in tax benefits from the utilization of a net operating loss that had not previously been applied against income 
increased gross margin our net income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our gross margin for the year ended december   increased compared to the previous year due primarily to significant increases in wholesale sales 
we sold million mwh of electricity to wholesale customers for the year ended december   compared to million mwh last year 
we were able to sell more electricity to our wholesale customers this year due to our not having had to conserve coal and our not having a planned refueling outage at wolf creek as we did last year 

table of contents increased capacity and future plans on january   we announced that we reached agreements with developers who will build three wind farms in kansas totaling approximately mws 
under the terms of the agreements  we plan to own approximately half of the wind generators at an expected cost of approximately million and purchase energy produced by the wind farms under twenty year supply contracts for the other half 
all three wind farms are expected to be producing energy by the end of on april   we completed the purchase of aquila  inc s aquila leasehold interest in jeffrey energy center for million and assumed the related lease obligation 
this lease expires on january   and has a purchase option at the end of the lease term 
based on current economic and other conditions  we expect to exercise the purchase option 
based upon these expectations  we recorded a capital lease of million 
in september  we announced plans to build a kv transmission line from our gordon evans energy center northwest of wichita  kansas  to a new substation near hutchinson  kansas  then on to our summit substation near salina  kansas  a distance totaling approximately miles 
in january  we filed an application with the kcc to request permission to site the line 
the kcc granted our permit on may  we expect to complete construction in late we expect the total investment in the line to be approximately million 
in addition to this line  we plan to construct a new kv line from our rose hill substation near wichita to the kansas oklahoma border  where we will interconnect with new facilities built by an oklahoma based utility 
the preliminary estimate of the total investment in the line is approximately million  which is subject to change pending selection of the final route and engineering design  among other factors 
on december   we filed an application with the kcc to request permission to site this line 
the kcc has until april   to act on our application 
in august  we announced plans to build a new natural gas fired combustion turbine peaking power plant near emporia in lyon county  kansas 
we expect the new plant  which we have named the emporia energy center  to have an initial generating capacity of approximately mw  with additional capacity to be added in a second phase  bringing the total capacity to approximately mw 
we expect the total investment in the plant to be about million 
construction on the new plant began in march the initial phase of the plant is scheduled to begin operation in may of the second phase is scheduled to begin operation in may of critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies  many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions by management 
the policies highlighted below have an impact on our reported results that may be material due to the levels of judgment and subjectivity necessary to account for uncertain matters or their susceptibility to change 
regulatory accounting we currently apply accounting standards for our regulated utility operations that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation in accordance with sfas no 
accordingly  we have recorded regulatory assets and liabilities when required by a regulatory order or based on regulatory precedent 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in utility rates 
regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to customers 
the deferral of costs as regulatory assets is appropriate only when the future recovery of such costs is probable 
in assessing probability  we consider such factors as specific regulatory orders  regulatory precedent and the current regulatory environment 
to the extent recovery of costs is no longer deemed to be probable  we would record a charge against income in the amount of the related regulatory assets 

table of contents pension and post retirement benefit plans actuarial assumptions we and wolf creek calculate our pension benefit and post retirement medical benefit obligations and related costs using actuarial concepts within the guidance provided by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
in accounting for our retirement plans and other post retirement benefits  we make assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the reported costs of our pension plans are impacted by estimates regarding earnings on plan assets  contributions to the plan  discount rates used to determine our projected benefit obligation and pension costs and employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods 
a change in any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on future costs  which may be reflected as an increase or decrease in net income in the current and future periods  or on the amount of related liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets or may also require cash contributions 
the following table shows the annual impact of a change in our pension plan discount rate  salary scale and rate of return on plan assets 
actuarial assumption change in assumption annual change in projected benefit obligation annual change in pension liability asset annual change in projected pension expense in thousands discount rate decrease    increase    salary scale decrease    increase    rate of return on plan assets decrease  increase  we recorded pension expense of approximately million in both and and million in these amounts reflect the pension expense of westar energy and our responsibility for the pension expense of wolf creek 
the increase in pension expense from to current levels is due primarily to the amortization of investment losses from prior years that are recognized on a rolling four year average basis and changes in assumptions including lower returns on assets  increases in salaries and updated mortality tables 
pension expense for is expected to be approximately million

amounts delivered to individual customers are determined through the systematic monthly readings of customer meters 
at the end of each month  the electric usage from the last meter reading is estimated and corresponding unbilled revenue is recorded 
the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors that include fluctuations in energy demands  weather  line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes 
we had estimated unbilled revenue of million as of december   and million as of december  we account for energy marketing derivative contracts under the mark to market method of accounting 
under this method  we recognize changes in the portfolio value as gains or losses in the period of change 
with the exception of a fuel supply contract and a capacity sale contract  which are recorded as regulatory liabilities  we include the net mark to market change in sales on our consolidated statements of income 
we record the resulting unrealized gains and losses as energy marketing long term or short term assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as appropriate 
we use quoted market prices to value our energy marketing derivative contracts when such data is available 
when market prices are not readily available or determinable  we use alternative approaches  such as model pricing 
prices used to value these transactions reflect our best estimate of the fair value of our contracts

income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
we recognize the future tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
we amortize deferred investment tax credits over the lives of the related properties 
we record deferred tax assets for capital losses  operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
however  when we believe we do not  or will not have sufficient future capital gain income or taxable income to realize the benefit of the capital loss  operating loss or tax credit carryforwards  we reduce the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance 
we recognize a valuation allowance if we determine  based on available evidence that it is unlikely that we will realize some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
we report the effect of a change in the valuation allowance in the current period tax expense 
as of january   we account for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make many subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as such  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  income taxes  for additional detail of our uncertainty in income taxes 
asset retirement obligations we calculate our asset retirement obligations and related costs using the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations and fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
we estimate our asset retirement obligations based on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation we incurred at the time the related long lived asset was either acquired  placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation become effective 
in determining our asset retirement obligations  we make assumptions regarding probable disposal costs 
a change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our asset retirement obligations reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 

table of contents contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and have estimated the probable cost for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates are based on an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible that our future results could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions

operating results we evaluate operating results based on earnings per share 
we have various classifications of sales  defined as follows retail sales of energy made to residential  commercial and industrial customers 
other retail sales of energy for lighting public streets and highways  net of revenue subject to refund 
tariff based wholesale sales of energy to electric cooperatives  municipalities and other electric utilities  the rates for which are generally based on cost as prescribed by ferc tariffs 
this category also includes changes in valuations of contracts that have yet to settle  the sales from which will be recorded as tariff based wholesale 
market based wholesale includes i sales of energy to wholesale customers  the rates for which are generally based on prevailing market prices as allowed by ferc approved market based tariff  or where not permitted  pricing is based on incremental cost plus a permitted margin and ii changes in valuations for contracts that have yet to settle  the sales of which will be recorded as market based wholesale 
energy marketing includes i transactions based on market prices with volumes not related to the production of our generating assets or the demand of our retail customers  ii financially settled products and physical transactions sourced outside our control area  iii fees we earn for marketing services that we provide for third parties  and iv changes in valuations for contracts that have yet to settle that are not recorded in tariff or market based wholesale revenues 
transmission reflects transmission revenues  including those based on a tariff with the spp 
other miscellaneous electric revenues including ancillary service revenues and rent from electric property leased to others 
regulated electric utility sales are significantly impacted by such things as rate regulation  customer conservation efforts  wholesale demand  the economy of our service area and competitive forces 
our wholesale sales are impacted by  among other factors  demand  cost and availability of fuel and purchased power  price volatility  available generation capacity and transmission availability 
changing weather affects the amount of electricity our customers use 
hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand  especially among our residential customers 
mild weather serves to reduce customer demand

year ended december  change change thousands of mwh residential commercial industrial other retail total retail tariff based wholesale market based wholesale total 
table of contents retail sales were million higher for the year ended december   due principally to increases in other retail  commercial and residential sales 
other retail sales increased million due primarily to decreases in refund obligations 
commercial and residential sales increased a combined million due primarily to cooler weather during the winter months  and customer growth in our service territory 
when measured by heating degree days  the weather during was cooler than during tariff based wholesale sales were million higher than last year  due principally to increased sales volumes that were primarily the result of additional sales from the long term sale agreement entered into in with mid kansas electric company  llc 
the average price per mwh for these sales  however  was about lower than the same period last year 
market based wholesale sales were million higher than last year  due principally to increased sales volumes that were primarily the result of coal conservation efforts and a scheduled refueling outage at wolf creek  both of which occurred last year and did not recur this year 
the average price per mwh for these sales  however  was about lower than the same period last year 
fuel and purchased power expense increased million compared to last year 
the change in fuel and purchased power expense resulted from a number of factors  including the volumes of power we produced and purchased  prevailing market prices and contract provisions that allow for price changes 
we used more fuel in our generating plants in  due primarily to our not having had to conserve coal this year as we did last year 
this resulted in million higher fuel expense compared with purchased power expense increased million over due primarily to higher prices  but were largely offset by a reduction in purchased volumes 
in through the reca  we deferred for future recovery million of fuel and purchased power costs as a regulatory asset compared with million in operating and maintenance expense increased million compared to last year 
this was due primarily to higher maintenance costs of million for our power plants  electrical distribution system and transmission system and a million increase in spp network transmission costs that are in large part recovered through higher transmission revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million compared to last year 
this was due principally to depreciation expense associated with a higher plant balance including the capital lease associated with the purchase of aquila s leasehold interest in jeffrey energy center 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative expense was due primarily to a million increase in employee benefit costs and a million increase in labor costs 
this increase was partially offset by reduced legal fees associated with matters having to deal with former management 
other income decreased million compared to last year due primarily to our having million from coli proceeds this year compared to million in proceeds from coli last year 
partially offsetting this decrease was million of equity allowance for funds used during construction afudc for the year ended december  we recorded no equity afudc for the same period last year 
income tax expense increased million compared to last year due primarily to decreases in the utilization of previously unrecognized capital loss carryforwards to offset realized capital gains and decreases in non taxable income from coli 
the increase was partially offset by increased tax benefits from the utilization of a net operating loss that had not previously been applied against income for other carryback or carryover years

table of contents the increase in retail sales reflects the change in rates  including the effect of implementing the reca  and warmer weather 
when measured by cooling degree days  the weather during was warmer than during and approximately warmer than the year average 
the increase in industrial sales was due primarily to additional oil refinery load 
the change in other retail sales reflects the recognition in of revenue subject to refund  of which i million is due to the difference between estimated fuel and purchased power costs billed to our customers and actual fuel and purchased power costs incurred for our westar energy customers  ii million is due to amounts associated with a transmission delivery charge approved by the kcc in its order  iii million collected for property taxes in excess of our actual property taxes obligations  and iv million related to amounts we collected in rates related to terminal net salvage that the february kcc order requires us to refund 
the revenue subject to refund was partially offset by our having stopped accruing for rebates to customers in december we made tariff based sales in at an average price that was about higher than the price of these sales in we attribute about million  or  of the increase in tariff based wholesale sales to higher prices reflecting an adjustment for our fuel costs as permitted in ferc tariffs 
our market based wholesale sales and sales volumes decreased in due primarily to our having conserved coal inventories  but the average price per mwh that we received for these sales in was about higher than in the change in fuel and purchased power expense is the result of changing volumes produced and purchased  prevailing market prices and contract provisions that allow for price changes 
we burned about less fuel in our generating plants in  due primarily to our having conserved coal inventories 
we also used less expensive generation 
in addition  during we deferred as a regulatory asset million for the difference between the estimated fuel and purchased power costs that we billed our kge customers and our higher actual fuel and purchased power costs that we are allowed to collect under the terms of the reca 
as a result  our fuel expense was million lower in than in we also experienced a million increase in our purchased power expense due primarily to our having purchased greater volumes than in we experienced an increase in our operating and maintenance expense due primarily to four factors i the amortization of million of previously deferred storm restoration expenses as authorized by the kcc order  ii a million increase in spp network transmission costs  iii a million increase in taxes other than income taxes due primarily to higher property taxes  and iv an increase in maintenance expenses for outages at la cygne and the gordon evans energy center 
these higher expenses were partially offset by a million reduction in the lease expense related to la cygne unit operating and maintenance expense in included a million loss as a result of the decrease in the present value of previously disallowed plant costs associated with the original construction of wolf creek due to the extension of the recovery period 
we experienced an increase in our depreciation and amortization expense of million 
this increase was due primarily to the reduction of depreciation expense of million in due to the establishment of a regulatory asset for the differences between the depreciation rates we used for financial reporting purposes and the depreciation rates authorized by the kcc for the period of august to march provisions of the kcc order allowed us to record this regulatory asset 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased due primarily to increased employee pension and benefit costs 
partially offsetting these increases were lower legal fees associated with matters having to deal with former management and a decline in insurance costs 
other income increased due primarily to coli 
we received million in income from coli in compared to million in associated with our having terminated an accounts receivable sales facility  we experienced a million decrease in other expense 

table of contents interest expense decreased due primarily to a million reduction in interest expense on long term debt due primarily to a lower long term debt balance and lower interest rates resulting from the refinancing activities discussed in detail in liquidity and capital resources debt financings 
this decline was partially offset by an increase of million in interest expense on short term debt due to increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the decrease in income tax expense is due primarily to the utilization of previously unrecognized capital loss carryforwards to offset realized capital gains and increases in non taxable income from coli 
financial condition a number of factors affected amounts recorded on our balance sheet as of december   compared to december  inventories and supplies increased million due primarily to a million increase in coal inventory that resulted largely from our having placed into service additional railcars that allowed for more frequent deliveries 
the fair market value of energy marketing contracts increased million to million at december  this was due primarily to favorable changes in market values of contracts entered into in  in addition to contracts outstanding the entire period 
regulatory assets  net of regulatory liabilities  increased to million at december   from million at december  total regulatory assets increased million due primarily to the accumulation and deferral for future recovery of million in costs related to restoring our electric distribution and transmission systems from damage sustained as a result of the december ice storm 
also significantly contributing to the increase in regulatory assets was a million increase in fuel costs deferred for future recovery 
total regulatory liabilities increased million to million due primarily to a million increase to mark to market gains recognized on our coal supply contract for lawrence and tecumseh energy centers 
removal costs increased regulatory liabilities an additional million as a result of amounts collected and not yet spent to retire assets which we are not legally obligated to retire 
the increases were offset due to our refunding to customers million  of which million was recorded as a regulatory liability as of december   as required in the february kcc order 
we increased our borrowings under the westar energy revolving credit facility 
as a result our short term debt increased million 
long term debt  net of current maturities increased million due principally to the issuance of million of first mortgage bonds as discussed in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term debt 
obligations under capital leases increased million due primarily to our assuming aquila s leasehold interest in jeffrey energy center as discussed in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  leases 
other long term liabilities increased million due primarily to the recognition of uncertain tax liabilities  including interest  pursuant to the adoption of fin common stock and paid in capital increased million due principally to the issuance of million shares of common stock for net proceeds of million through sales agency financing agreements with bnycmi and a forward sale agreement 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview we believe we will have sufficient cash to fund future operations  pay debt maturities and dividends from a combination of cash on hand  cash flows from operations and access to debt and equity capital markets 
our available sources of funds include cash  westar energy s revolving credit facility and access to capital markets 
uncertainties affecting our ability to meet these cash requirements include  among others factors affecting sales described in operating results above  economic conditions  regulatory actions  conditions in the capital markets and compliance with environmental regulations 
capital resources as of december   we had million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  westar energy has a million revolving credit facility against which million had been borrowed and million of letters of credit had been issued 
this left million available under this facility 
on january   we filed a request with ferc for authority to issue short term securities and to pledge mortgage bonds in order to increase the size of our revolving credit facility to million 
on february   ferc granted our request and on february   a syndicate of banks in our credit facility increased their commitments  which in the aggregate total million 
as of february   million had been borrowed and million of letters of credit had been issued  leaving million available under this facility 
the westar energy and kge mortgages each contain provisions restricting the amount of first mortgage bonds that can be issued by each entity 
we must comply with such restrictions prior to the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness 
the westar energy mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless westar energy s unconsolidated net earnings available for interest  depreciation and property retirement which as defined  does not include earnings or losses attributable to the ownership of securities of subsidiaries  for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance  are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest charges on  and of the principal amount of  all first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
in addition  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
as of december   based on an assumed interest rate of  million principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage  except in connection with certain refundings 
the kge mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless kge s net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and depreciation of property for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance are not less than either two and one half times the annual interest charges on  or of the principal amount of  all kge first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
in addition  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
as of december   based on an assumed interest rate of  approximately million principal amount of additional kge first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage 

table of contents on april   we entered into a sales agency financing agreement with bny capital markets  inc bnycmi 
as of july   we had sold million of common stock  shares through bnycmi  as agent  pursuant to the agreement 
we received million in proceeds net of a commission paid to bnycmi equal to of the sales price of all shares it sold under the agreement 
we used the proceeds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which is the primary liquidity facility for acquiring capital equipment  and any remainder was used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
on august   we entered into a subsequent sales agency financing agreement with bnycmi 
under the terms of the agreement  we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through bnycmi  as agent  up to an aggregate of million for a period of no more than three years 
we will pay bnycmi a commission equal to of the sales price of all shares sold under the agreement 
as of december   we had sold million of common stock  shares through bnycmi 
we received million in proceeds net of commission paid to bnycmi 
we used the proceeds to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which is the primary liquidity facility for acquiring capital equipment  and any remainder was used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
pursuant to the same program  in the period january   through february   we sold an additional  shares for million  net of commission 
on november   we entered into a forward equity sale agreement forward sale agreement with ubs ag  london branch ubs  as forward purchaser  relating to million shares of our common stock 
the forward sale agreement provides for the sale of our common stock within approximately twelve months at a stated settlement price 
in connection with the forward sale agreement  ubs borrowed an equal number of shares of our common stock from stock lenders and sold the borrowed shares to jp morgan securities  inc jpm under an underwriting agreement among westar energy  jpm and ubs securities  llc  as co managers for the underwriters 
the underwriters subsequently offered the borrowed shares to the public at a price per share of 
the use of a forward sale agreement allows us to avoid equity market uncertainty by pricing a stock offering under then existing market conditions  while mitigating share dilution by postponing the issuance of stock until funds are needed 
except in specified circumstances or events that would require physical share settlement  we are able to elect to settle the forward sale agreement by means of a physical share  cash or net share settlement and are also able to elect to settle the agreement in whole  or in part  earlier than the stated maturity date at fixed settlement prices 
under a physical share or net share settlement  the maximum number of shares that are deliverable under the terms of the forward sale agreement is limited to million shares 
on december   we delivered million newly issued shares of our common stock to ubs  and received proceeds of million as partial settlement of the forward sale agreement 
additionally  on february   we delivered million shares and received proceeds of million as partial settlement of the forward sale agreement 
assuming gross share settlement of all remaining shares under the forward sale agreement  we could receive additional aggregate proceeds of approximately million  based on a forward price of per share for million shares 
proceeds from these offerings were used to repay borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which is the primary liquidity facility for acquiring capital equipment  and any remainder was used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities decreased million to million in  from million in during  as compared to  we paid approximately million more for natural gas used in our power plants  million more for coal inventory and million more in customer refunds 
offsetting these amounts were a million reduction in la cygne unit lease payments  million less in voluntary contributions to our pension trust and cash realized from higher gross margins 
during  we also used million related to the termination of our accounts receivable sales program 
cash flows from operating activities decreased million to million in  from million in during  we used million to pay federal and state income taxes and made a million contribution to our defined benefit pension trust 
during  we used approximately million for system restoration costs related to the ice storm that affected our service territory in january we received million in tax refunds during 
table of contents cash flows used in investing activities in general  cash used for investing purposes relates to the growth and improvement of our electric utility business 
the utility business is capital intensive and requires significant investment in plant on an annual basis 
we spent million in  million in and million in on net additions to utility property  plant and equipment 
this increase is due primarily to our having begun construction on several generation and transmission projects and our having purchased other generating facilities during cash flows used in financing activities we received net cash flows from financing activities of million in in  proceeds from the issuance of long term debt provided million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock provided million 
we used cash to pay million in dividends 
in  we received net cash flows from financing activities of million 
in  an increase in short term debt was the principal source of cash flows from financing activities 
cash from financing activities was used to retire long term debt and to pay dividends 
in  we received cash primarily from the issuance of long term debt and we used cash primarily to retire long term debt and pay dividends 
future cash requirements our business requires significant capital investments 
through  we expect we will need cash primarily for utility construction programs designed to improve facilities providing electric service  which include but are not limited to expenditures for future peaking capacity needs  construction of new transmission lines and for compliance with environmental regulations 
we expect to meet these cash needs with internally generated cash flow  borrowings under westar energy s revolving credit facility and through the issuance of securities in the capital markets 
we have incurred and expect to continue to incur material costs to comply with existing and future environmental laws and regulations  all of which are subject to changing interpretations and amendments 
in addition  the current focus on the effect of air emissions on the global environment could result in significantly more stringent laws and regulations or interpretations thereof that could affect our company and industry in particular 
these laws  regulations and interpretations could result in more stringent terms in our existing operating permits or a failure to obtain new permits  could cause there to be a material increase in our capital or operational costs and could otherwise have a material effect on our operations 
while we believe we can generally recover environmental costs through rate increases  there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so 
in addition  we may be subject to significant fines and penalties in connection with the nsr investigation or other matters  and such fines and penalties cannot be recovered through rate increases

actual in thousands generation replacements and other additional capacity wind generation environmental nuclear fuel transmission distribution replacements and other new customers other total capital expenditures we prepare these estimates for planning purposes and revise our estimates from time to time 
actual expenditures will differ  perhaps materially  from our estimates due to changing environmental requirements  changing costs  delays in engineering  construction or permitting  and other factors discussed above in item a 
risk factors 
we and our generating plant co owners periodically evaluate these estimates  and this may result in frequent and possibly material changes in actual costs 
in addition  these amounts do not include any estimates for expenditures that may be incurred as a result of the nsr investigation or for potentially new environmental requirements relating to mercury and co emissions

a default by westar energy or kge under other indebtedness totaling more than million is a default under this facility 
westar energy is required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio not greater than at all times 
available liquidity under the facility is not impacted by a decline in westar energy s credit ratings 
also  the facility does not contain a material adverse effect clause requiring westar energy to represent  prior to each borrowing  that no event resulting in a material adverse effect has occurred 
on june   we refinanced million of pollution control bonds  which were to mature in we replaced this issue with two new pollution control bond series of million each

table of contents allowance for funds used during construction afudc represents the cost of capital used to finance utility construction activity 
afudc is computed by applying a composite rate to qualified construction work in progress 
the amount of afudc capitalized as a construction cost is credited to other income for equity funds and interest expense for borrowed funds on the accompanying consolidated statements of income  as follows year ended december  in thousands borrowed funds equity funds total average afudc rates we expect both afudc for borrowed funds and equity funds to fluctuate over the next several years as we add capacity  expand our transmission system  make environmental improvements and begin to recover the related costs in rates 
interest expense we expect interest expense to increase significantly over the next several years as we issue new debt securities to fund our capital expenditures program 
we believe the increase in interest expense will be recovered from our customers in future rate proceedings 
wholesale sales margins the terms of the reca require that we include  as a credit to recoverable fuel costs beginning in april of each year  an amount based on the average of the margins realized from market based wholesale sales during the immediately prior three year period ending june effective april   we began crediting our retail customers an annual amount of million 
beginning on april   we will begin crediting our retail customers an annual amount of million 
it is possible that we will not realize market based wholesale sales margins at least equal to the amount of the credit 
this would adversely affect our financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our fuel procurement and energy marketing activities involve primary market risk exposures  including commodity price risk  interest rate risk and credit risk 
commodity price risk is the potential adverse price impact related to purchase or sell of electricity and fuel procurement for our generating units 
interest rate risk is the potential adverse financial impact related to changes in interest rates 
credit risk is the potential adverse financial impact resulting from non performance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations 
market price risks we engage in physical and financial trading activities with the goals of reducing risk from market fluctuations  enhancing system reliability and increasing profits 
we procure and trade electricity  coal  natural gas and other energy related products by utilizing energy commodity contracts and a variety of financial instruments  including forward and futures contracts  options and swaps 

table of contents prices in the wholesale power markets often are extremely volatile 
this volatility impacts our cost of power purchased and our participation in energy trades 
if we were unable to generate an adequate supply of electricity for our customers  we would attempt to purchase power from others 
such supplies are not always available 
in addition  congestion on the transmission system can limit our ability to make purchases from or sell into the wholesale markets 
the inability to make wholesale purchases may require that we interrupt or curtail services to our customers 
net open positions exist  or are established  due to the origination of new transactions and our assessment of  and response to  changing market conditions 
to the extent we have open positions  we are exposed to changes in market prices 
additional factors that affect our commodity price exposure are the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume 
the availability and deliverability of generating fuel  including fossil and nuclear fuels  can vary significantly from one period to the next 
our customers electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors 
the loss of revenues or higher costs associated with such conditions could be material and adverse to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
our risk of loss is mitigated through the use of the reca and similar adjustment mechanisms that we maintain for many of our wholesale sales contracts and tariffs 
hedging activity in an effort to mitigate market risk associated with fuel procurement and energy marketing  we may use economic hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to price changes 
we may use physical contracts and financial derivative instruments to hedge the price of a portion of our anticipated fossil fuel needs or excess generation sales 
at the time we enter into these transactions  we are unable to determine the hedge value until the agreements are actually settled 
our future exposure to changes in prices will be dependent on the market prices and the extent and effectiveness of any economic hedging arrangements into which we enter 
commodity price exposure we manage and measure the market price risk exposure of our trading portfolio using a variance covariance value at risk var model 
in addition to var  we employ additional risk control processes such as stress testing  daily loss limits  credit limits and position limits 
we expect to use similar control processes in the use of var requires assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level for potential losses and the estimated holding period 
we express var as a potential dollar loss based on a confidence level using a one day holding period 
it is possible that actual results may differ markedly from assumptions 
accordingly  var may not accurately reflect our levels of exposures 
the energy trading and market based wholesale portfolio var amounts for and were as follows in thousands high low average we have considered a variety of risks and costs associated with the future contractual commitments included in our trading portfolios 
these risks include valuation and marking of illiquid pricing locations and products  interest rate movement and the financial condition of our counterparties 
we may use swaps or other financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
we have exposure to counterparty default risk with our retail  wholesale and energy marketing activities  including participation in regional transmission organizations 
we maintain credit policies intended to reduce overall credit risk 
we employ additional credit risk control mechanisms that we believe are appropriate  such as requiring counterparties to issue letters of credit or parental guarantees in our favor and entering into master netting agreements with counterparties that allow for offsetting exposures 
there can be no assurance that the employment of var  credit practices or other risk management tools we employ will eliminate possible losses 

table of contents interest rate exposure we have entered into various fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
for details  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term debt 
we compute and present information about the sensitivity to changes in interest rates for variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt by assuming a basis point change in the current interest rate applicable to such debt over the remaining time the debt is outstanding 
we had approximately million of variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt as of december  a basis point change in interest rates applicable to this debt would impact income before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately million 
as of december   we had million of variable rate bonds insured by bond insurers 
interest rates payable under these bonds are set at periodic auctions 
recent conditions in the credit markets have decreased the demand of auction bonds generally and have caused our borrowing costs to increase 
additionally  should those bond insurers experience a decrease in credit rating  such event would most likely increase our borrowing costs as well 
in addition  a decline in interest rates generally can serve to increase our pension and post retirement obligations and affect investment returns 
security price risk we maintain trust funds  as required by the nrc and kansas state laws  to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning 
as of december   these funds were comprised of equity securities  debt securities and cash and cash equivalents 
the fair value of these funds was million as of december   and million as of december  by maintaining a diversified portfolio of securities  we seek to maximize the returns to fund the decommissioning obligation within acceptable risk tolerances 
however  debt and equity securities in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in the capital markets 
if the value of the securities diminishes  the cost of funding the obligation rises 
we actively monitor the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of the investments against relevant indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing the asset allocation in relation to established policy targets 
our exposure to equity price market risk is  in part  mitigated because we are currently allowed to recover decommissioning costs in the rates we charge our customers
