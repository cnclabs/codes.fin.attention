item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview genaera corporation is a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing the science and treatment of metabolic diseases 
our research and development efforts are focused on obesity and type diabetes 
in addition  we have a fully out licensed partnership with medimmune for the development and commercialization of respiratory therapies related to our il program 
since commencing operations in  we have not generated any revenue from product sales 
we have funded operations primarily from the proceeds of public and private placements of securities  research and development collaboration payments and related equity investments 
we have incurred a loss in each year since our inception and we expect to incur substantial additional losses for at least the next several years 
we expect that losses may fluctuate and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
at december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we believe our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  are sufficient to fund operations and meet our research and development goals into the fourth quarter of however  we will also need to raise additional funds and are currently exploring alternatives  such as equity or debt financing and or the licensing of the rights to one or more of our product candidates 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing shareholders may result 
if we engage in collaborations  we may receive lower consideration upon commercialization of such products than if we had not entered into such arrangements  or if we entered into such arrangements at later stages in the product development process 
if we fail to obtain capital when required  we may be required to delay  scale back  or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
the following discussion is included to describe our financial position and results of operations for each of the years ended december  and the financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the following are critical accounting policies that are important to our financial condition and results of operations and require management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition contract revenue for research and development is recorded as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and for which there is no continuing involvement by us  are recognized at the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and certain guaranteed payments where we have continuing involvement through development collaboration is recognized on a straight line basis over the development period 
revenue associated with performance milestones is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones as defined in the respective agreements 
revenue under research and development cost reimbursement contracts is recognized as the related costs are incurred 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as liabilities until earned 
payments received that are refundable also are classified as liabilities until the refund provision expires 
we make an estimate as to the appropriate deferral period for recognition of revenue on any collaborative development programs 
changes in these estimates due to the evolution of the development program can have a significant effect on the timing of when revenue is recorded 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include related salaries  contractor fees and facility costs 
research and development expenses consist of independent research and development contract costs  contract manufacturing 
table of contents costs and costs associated with collaborative research and development arrangements 
in addition  we fund research and development at other research institutions under agreements that are generally cancelable 
research and development expenses also include external activities  such as investigator sponsored trials 
all such costs are charged to research and development expense systematically as incurred  which may be measured by patient enrollment or the passage of time 
at the initiation of certain contracts  we must make an estimate as to the duration and expected completion date of the contract  which may require a change due to accelerations  delays or other adjustments to the contract period or work performed 
changes in these estimates could have a significant effect on the amount of research and development costs in a specific period 
while we have historically made changes to the estimates underlying our research and developments costs  none of those changes were material for any historical period 
future changes in these estimates could have a significant effect on the amount of research and development costs in a specific period 
stock based compensation we account for stock based employee compensation using the modified prospective method set forth by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that compensation cost for all stock based awards be measured at fair value on the date of grant and recognized over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of stock option grants is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
such amounts  net of estimated forfeitures  are recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period using the accelerated method under sfas r 
results of operations vs 
revenues we recognized revenue of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have received no revenues to date from product sales 
revenues recorded to date have consisted principally of revenues recognized under collaborations with third parties 
in april  we entered into a research collaboration and licensing agreement with medimmune to develop and commercialize therapies related to our il program 
medimmune provided funding of million  payable in eight equal quarterly installments through april in addition  medimmune reimburses external costs for certain research and development activities and for patent prosecution expenses 
we could also receive up to million of additional funding based on successful completion of future milestones 
in december  we received a milestone payment of million as a result of the initiation of phase clinical trials 
for the year ended december   we recognized million as revenue related to external cost reimbursements  of which million related to reimbursement for expenses incurred in prior periods 
the revenue and expense amounts related to a prior period were determined to be immaterial to the current and prior periods 
for the year ended december   we recognized million as revenue related to external cost reimbursements million and milestone payments million 
in september  we received a contingent award of up to million from cystic fibrosis foundation therapeutics cfft  an affiliate of the cystic fibrosis foundation  to support early clinical evaluation of lomucin involving subjects with cystic fibrosis 
in april  the award was increased to million  consisting of million previously received in connection with our initial phase trial of lomucin and up to million in milestone driven matching funds from cfft to support a multi center  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled phase clinical trial of lomucin 
after consultation with cfft  the protocol for this trial was amended in june to decrease the number of evaluable subjects to be enrolled in the trial from to as a result of the decrease in the number of evaluable subjects  the total contract funding for our phase clinical evaluation of lomucin was reduced from million to million or million  depending upon the final milestone achieved 
in june  we and cfft agreed  for reasons of futility  to discontinue the phase trial of lomucin and terminated the award agreement 
as a result of the termination  we recognized revenue of million in the year ended december   of which million was recorded as a long term liability at december  
table of contents in april  we received a phase small business innovative research sbir program grant from the national institute of diabetes and digestive and kidney diseases of the national institutes of health nih in the amount of million to support our trodusquemine program 
the grant extended over a one year period which ended in march in march  we notified the nih of a no cost extension to the original budget period by twelve months 
as a result of the notification  the grant was extended to march we recognized million of revenue related to this grant in the year ended december  in september  we received a phase sbir program grant from the national eye institute of the nih in the amount of million to support our aminosterols for amd program 
the grant extended over a one year period  which ended in august in august  we notified the nih of a no cost extension to the original budget period by twelve months 
as a result of the notification  the grant was extended to august we recognized million of revenue related to this grant in the year ended december  in february  we entered into an agreement to provide pexiganan cream to a research facility for its conduct of a research study 
as a result of this agreement  we recognized  as revenue in the year ended december  in may  we received a one time payment as a result of the licensing by licr of certain patents jointly owned by licr and genaera pursuant to the second research agreement between licr and genaera dated december  we recognized the payment of million  which related to a prior period  as revenue in the year ended december  the revenue amount related to a prior period was determined to be immaterial to the current and prior periods 
research and development expenses our research and development programs include trodusquemine msi for the treatment of obesity and type diabetes  anti il antibody  lomucin talniflumate and other programs consisting of other aminosterols for the treatment of inflammatory disorders  squalamine lactate for oncology and wet amd  and locilex pexiganan cream for the treatment of infectious disease 
the following table illustrates our research and development projects and the stage to which each has been developed development stage status trodusquemine phase active il phase inactive lomucin phase inactive squalamine squalamine phase inactive evizon squalamine phase inactive other programs locilex cream phase inactive other aminosterols research active in april  we entered into a collaborative agreement with medimmune to develop and commercialize therapies related to our il program 
the licensed technology has been transferred to medimmune and medimmune has assumed responsibility for development and commercialization efforts on the il program 
in june  we closed enrollment in our lomucin clinical development program for the treatment of cystic fibrosis 
final data collection and evaluation will continue throughout the first half of in july  we announced the termination of our squalamine clinical development program for the treatment of prostate cancer 
in january  we announced the termination of our evizon clinical development program for the treatment of wet amd 
in october  we entered into an agreement to license the exclusive worldwide rights for use of pexiganan as a drug to macrochem 

table of contents research and development expenses for each of our projects consist of both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include salaries and other costs of personnel  raw materials and supplies for each project 
we also may incur third party costs related to these projects  such as contract research  clinical development and manufacturing costs and consulting costs 
indirect expenses include depreciation expense and the costs of operating and maintaining our facilities  property and equipment  to the extent used for our research and development projects  as well as the costs of general management of our research and development projects 
we recognized research and development expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
the following table illustrates research and development expenses in thousands incurred during the years ended december  and for our significant groups of research and development projects years ended december  trodusquemine program expenses il program expenses lomucin program expenses squalamine program expenses other program expenses indirect expenses research and development expenses decreased in the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due to decreases in clinical trial costs million  personnel costs million  third party contract research costs million  manufacturing expenses million  and costs for consulting and supplies million related to our squalamine program for the treatment of wet amd and decreases in personnel costs million and manufacturing expenses million related to our lomucin program 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in clinical trial costs million  personnel costs million  manufacturing expenses million  third party contract research million and costs for consulting and supplies million related to our trodusquemine obesity therapeutic program  as well as increases in clinical trial costs million related to our lomucin program and increases in personnel costs million and third party contract research costs million related to our il program 
in addition  indirect expenses decreased primarily due to decreased consulting expense million  temporary labor million and other indirect costs million  partially offset by increases in indirect personnel costs million and realignment costs associated with the reductions in force million 
the costs incurred to date on each of our development projects are not reasonably estimable because work on one program often supports or enhances another program 
for example  it is not possible to separate the time and resources spent in development of squalamine lactate as a product candidate to treat wet amd and as a product candidate to treat cancer because i early research and development efforts devoted to cancer research led to the development of our product candidate squalamine lactate trade name evizon for amd  ii clinical trial work pursuant to our ind application for cancer forms part of the safety data base for the ind application we filed with the fda for wet amd  iii our manufacturing development for squalamine lactate supports both the amd and cancer programs  iv trodusquemine and squalamine are synthesized from the same starting material and a significant number of steps in the synthesis are identical  and v nonclinical testing conducted supports all regulatory filings and proposed indications for squalamine 
the level of research and development expenses in future periods will depend principally upon the progress of our research and development programs and our capital resources 
due to the significant risks and uncertainties inherent in the preclinical and clinical studies associated with each of our research and development programs  the cost to complete such programs  as well as the period in which net cash inflows from significant programs are expected to commence  are not reasonably estimable 
preclinical and clinical studies may yield 
table of contents varying results that could delay  limit or prevent a program s advancement through the various stages of product development and significantly impact the costs to be incurred and the time involved in bringing a program to completion 
such delays  limitations or prevention of a program s advancement could harm our financial condition and operating results and inhibit our ability to raise additional funds to support ongoing operations 
the nature of costs incurred in the future will also vary depending upon the stage of the product candidate s development 
product candidates in the research stage often require significant laboratory work to develop and prepare the product candidate for preclinical testing and for testing in humans 
costs for such work typically include our staff  our facilities  lab supplies and equipment and fees to contract research facilities supervised by our personnel 
all products to be tested in humans require preclinical testing and often require additional nonclinical testing while clinical trials are in process to fulfill regulatory requirements 
preclinical and nonclinical work requires expenditures for staffing and facilities 
costs will also be incurred for work done by contract research facilities under our supervision 
early stage products require development of manufacturing methods  supporting analytical and research work and qualifying vendors  including contract manufacturers 
products in human testing  particularly later stage trials  require manufacturing more significant quantities of product 
the costs of conducting clinical trials include fees to contract research organizations to conduct the trials  payments to physicians and research centers  and payments for a wide range of services to prepare for clinical trials  support the trials and manage data gathered in the trials 
internal costs for clinical trials include staffing and infrastructure to design  adapt and manage the trials  as well as managing vendors providing supporting services 
smaller but continuing costs throughout the clinical trials process also include quality control and regulatory compliance activities conducted by our staff and through contractors under our supervision 
general and administrative expenses we recognized general and administrative expenses of million and million in and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of personnel costs  professional fees and public company expenses 
general and administrative costs increased in the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due principally to increases in stock based compensation expense million  bonus expense million and realignment costs associated with the reductions in force million 
there were also increases in legal fees million associated with our strategic review in these increases were partially offset by a decrease in consultant expenses million 
interest income and other we recognized interest income of million and million in and  respectively 
interest income is primarily comprised of income generated from cash and investments 
interest income decreased during the year ended december   as compared to the same period a year ago  due to lower average investment balances 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  as compared to million at december  the primary use of cash was to fund our research and development operations 
current liabilities increased by million from million at december  to million at december   due to an increase in current deferred revenue associated with the licensing of pexiganan to macrochem 
our capital expenditure requirements depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  the time and cost required to obtain regulatory approvals  our ability to enter into 
table of contents additional collaborative arrangements  the demand for products based on our technology  if and when such products are approved  and possible acquisitions of products  technologies and companies 
we had no significant capital commitments as of december  our goal is to conduct significant research  pre clinical development  clinical testing and manufacturing activities over the next several years 
we expect that these activities  together with projected general and administrative expenses  will result in continued and significant losses 
since inception  we have funded our operations primarily from the proceeds of public and private placements of our securities totaling approximately million since our initial public offering in december  including the proceeds from a private placement of our securities  net of costs  of million in june in addition to the above  we have funded our operations from contract and grant revenues  research and development expense reimbursements and interest income 
we regularly explore alternative means of financing our operations and seek funding through various sources  including public and private securities offerings  collaborative arrangements with third parties and other strategic alliances and business transactions 
we currently do not have any commitments to obtain additional funds  and may be unable to obtain sufficient funding in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we cannot obtain funding  we will need to delay  scale back or eliminate research and development programs or enter into collaborations with third parties to commercialize potential products or technologies that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves  or seek other arrangements 
if we engage in collaborations  we may receive lower consideration upon commercialization of such products than if we had not entered into such arrangements  or if we entered into such arrangements at later stages in the product development process 
we have prepared our financial statements assuming that we will continue as a going concern  which contemplates realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
we have incurred net losses since inception and we expect to generate losses from operations for the foreseeable future primarily due to research and development costs for msi we believe our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  are sufficient to fund operations and meet our research and development goals into the fourth quarter of we have commenced a cost savings initiative and plan to reduce our projected operating expenses in however  we will also need to raise additional funds and are currently exploring alternatives  such as equity or debt financing and or the licensing of the rights to one or more of our product candidates 
if additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing shareholders may result 
if we engage in collaborations  we may receive lower consideration upon commercialization of such products than if we had not entered into such arrangements  or if we entered into such arrangements at later stages in the product development process 
if we fail to obtain capital when required  we may be required to delay  scale back  or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for the measurement of fair value  and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measures 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
both sfas and sfas are effective for our quarterly reporting period ending march   however in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
to partially delay the effective date of sfas for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  until fiscal years beginning after november  we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas and sfas will have an impact on our results of operations and financial position 

table of contents in december  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements eitf  which provides guidance concerning determining whether an arrangement constitutes a collaborative arrangement within the scope of the issue  how costs incurred and revenue generated on sales to third parties and payments between participants pursuant to a collaboration agreement should be presented in the results of operations and what participants should disclose in the notes to the financial statements about a collaborative arrangement 
eitf will be adopted in we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of eitf will have  if any  on our financial statements 
in june  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf provides guidance concerning the accounting for nonrefundable advance payments made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities 
the eitf concluded that an entity must defer and capitalize nonrefundable advance payments made for research and development activities and expense these amounts as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
eitf will be adopted in we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of eitf will have  if any  on our financial statements
