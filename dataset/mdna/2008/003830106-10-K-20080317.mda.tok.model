item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations prior to february  grey wolf exploration inc was a wholly owned canadian subsidiary of abraxas 
in february  grey wolf closed on an initial public offering resulting in the substantial divestiture of our capital stock in grey wolf 
as a result of the grey wolf ipo  and the significant divestiture of our interest in grey wolf  the results of operations of grey wolf are reflected in our financial statements and in this document as discontinued operations and our remaining operations are referred to in our financial statements and in this document as continuing operations or continued operations 
unless otherwise noted  all disclosures are for continuing operations 
the following is a discussion of our consolidated financial condition  results of continuing operations  liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
see financial statements in item general we are an independent energy company primarily engaged in the development  and production of natural gas and crude oil 
historically  we have grown through the acquisition and subsequent development and exploration of producing properties  principally through the redevelopment of old fields utilizing new technologies such as modern log analysis and reservoir modeling techniques as well as d seismic surveys and horizontal drilling 
as a result of these activities  we believe that we have a number of development opportunities on our properties 
in addition  we intend to expand upon our development activities with complementary exploration projects in our core areas of operation 
success in our development and exploration activities is critical in the maintenance and growth on our current production levels and associated reserves 
while we have attained positive net income from continuing operations in four of the last five years  there can be no assurance that operating income and net earnings will be achieved in future periods 
our financial results depend upon many factors which significantly affect our results of operations including the following the sales prices of natural gas and crude oil  the level of total sales volumes of natural gas and crude oil  the availability of  and our ability to raise additional capital resources and provide liquidity to meet  cash flow needs  the level of and interest rates on borrowings  and the level and success of exploration and development activity 
commodity prices and hedging activities 
the results of our operations are highly dependent upon the prices received for our natural gas and crude oil production 
the prices we receive for our production are dependent upon spot market prices  price differentials and the effectiveness of our hedging arrangements 
substantially all of our sales of natural gas and crude oil are made in the spot market  or pursuant to contracts based on spot market prices  and not pursuant to long term  fixed price contracts 
accordingly  the prices received for our natural gas and crude oil production are dependent upon numerous factors beyond our control 
significant declines in prices for natural gas and crude oil could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
recently  the prices of natural gas and crude oil have been volatile 
during the first half of  prices for natural gas and crude oil were sustained at record or near record levels 
supply and geopolitical uncertainties resulted in significant price volatility during the remainder of with both natural gas and crude oil prices weakening 
during  crude oil prices remained strong while natural gas prices remained strong but weakened during the course of the year 
new york mercantile exchange nymex spot prices for west texas intermediate wti crude oil averaged per barrel during wti crude oil ended the year at per barrel 
nymex henry hub spot prices for natural gas averaged per million british thermal units mmbtu during and ended the year at 
the realized prices that we receive for our production differ from nymex futures and spot market prices  principally due to basis differentials which are dependent on actual delivery location  adjustments for btu content  and gathering  processing and transportation costs 
during  differentials averaged per boe of crude oil and per mcf of natural gas 
we expect to realize greater differentials during because of the increased percentage of our production from the rocky mountain region 
under the terms of the partnership credit facility  abraxas energy partners was required to enter into hedging arrangements for specified volumes  which equated to approximately of the estimated oil and gas production through december  from its net proved developed producing reserves 
the partnership intends to enter into hedging arrangements in the future to reduce the impact of price volatility on its cash flow 
by removing a significant portion of price volatility on its future oil and gas production  the partnership believes it will mitigate  but not eliminate  the potential effects of changing commodity gas prices on its cash flow from operations for those periods 
the following table sets forth our hedge position at march  period covered hedged product hedged volume production per day weighted average fixed price year natural gas  mmbtu year crude oil  bbl year natural gas  mmbtu year crude oil  bbl year natural gas  mmbtu year crude oil bbl year natural gas  mmbtu year crude oil bbl at december   the aggregate fair market value of our hedges was approximately million 
production volumes 
because our proved reserves will decline as natural gas and crude oil are produced  unless we find  acquire or develop additional properties containing proved reserves or conduct successful exploration and development activities  our reserves and production will decrease 
approximately of the estimated ultimate recovery of abraxas and of the partnership s  or of our consolidated proved developed producing reserves as of december  had been produced 
based on the reserve information set forth in our reserve report of december   abraxas average annual estimated decline rate for its net proved developed producing reserves is during the first five years  in the next five years  and approximately thereafter 
based on the reserve information set forth in our reserve report of december   the partnership s average annual estimated decline rate for its net proved developed producing reserves is during the first five years  in the next five years and approximately thereafter 
these rates of decline are estimates and actual production declines could be materially higher 
while abraxas has had some success in finding  acquiring and developing additional revenues  abraxas has not been able to fully replace the production volumes lost from natural field declines and prior property sales 
for example  in  abraxas replaced only of the reserves it produced 
in  however  we replaced of the reserves we produced 
our ability to acquire or find additional reserves in the near future will be dependent  in part  upon the amount of available funds for acquisition  exploration and development projects 
please see results of operations selected operation data for a presentation of our production levels for the three years 
we had capital expenditures during of million including a million deposit on the st 
mary property acquisition that closed in january   and have a capital budget for of approximately million  of which million is applicable to abraxas and million applicable to the partnership 
the final amount of our capital expenditures for will depend on our success rate  production levels  the availability of capital and commodity prices 
availability of capital 
as described more fully under liquidity and capital resources below  abraxas sources of capital going forward will primarily be cash from operating activities  funding under the credit facility  cash on hand  distributions from the partnership and if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  proceeds from the sale of properties 
abraxas energy partners principal sources of capital will be cash from operating activities  borrowings under the partnership credit facility  and sales of debt or equity securities if available to it 
at december   abraxas had approximately million of availability under the credit facility and the partnership had approximately million of availability under the partnership credit facility 
upon the closing of the acquisition of properties described in general business recent events  the partnership borrowed million under its amended partnership credit facility and million under its subordinate credit agreement 
upon the completion of this transaction  the partnership had million available under its amended credit facility 
exploration and development activity 
we believe that our high quality asset base  high degree of operational control and inventory of drilling projects position us for future growth 
our properties are concentrated in locations that facilitate substantial economies of scale in drilling and production operations and more efficient reservoir management practices 
at december   we operated of the properties accounting for approximately of our pv  giving us substantial control over the timing and incurrence of operating and capital expenditures 
over the five years ended december   we drilled gross net wells of which resulted in commercially productive wells 
our future natural gas and crude oil production  and therefore our success  is highly dependent upon our ability to find  acquire and develop additional reserves that are profitable to produce 
the rate of production from our natural gas and crude oil properties and our proved reserves will decline as our reserves are produced unless we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves  conduct successful development and exploration activities or  through engineering studies  identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
we cannot assure you that our exploration and development activities will result in increases in our proved reserves 
in  for example  abraxas replaced only of the reserves it produced 
in  however  we replaced of our reserves 
if our proved reserves decline in the future  our production will also decline and  consequently  our cash flow from operations  distributions of available cash from the partnership to abraxas and the amount that abraxas is able to borrow under its credit facility and that the partnership will be able to borrow under its credit facility will also decline 
in addition  approximately of abraxas and of the partnership s estimated proved reserves at december  were undeveloped 
by their nature  estimates of undeveloped reserves are less certain 
recovery of such reserves will require significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
we may be unable to acquire or develop additional reserves  in which case our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
borrowings and interest 
abraxas energy partners currently has indebtedness of approximately under the amended partnership credit facility and million under its subordinated credit agreement 
the partnership has million available under its amended partnership credit facility 
abraxas has availability of million under its million credit facility 
there is currently no outstanding balance under this facility 
if interest expense increases as a result of higher interest rates or increased borrowings  more cash flow from operations would be used to meet debt service requirements 
as a result  we would need to increase our cash flow from operations in order to fund the development of our numerous drilling opportunities which  in turn  will be dependent upon the level of our production volumes and commodity prices 
results of operations selected operating data 
the following table sets forth certain of our operating data for the periods presented 
all data has been restated to reflect continuing operations 
average prices reflect realized prices including the impact of hedging activities 
years ended december  dollars in thousands  except per unit data 
operating revenue crude oil sales natural gas sales realized hedge gain loss unrealized hedge gain loss rig and other total operating revenues operating income crude oil production mbbls natural gas production mmcf average crude oil sales price per bbl average natural gas sales price per mcf revenue is before the impact of hedging activities 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue 
during the year ended december   operating revenue from natural gas and crude oil sales decreased by million from million in to million in the decrease in revenue was primarily due to decreased production volumes in as compared to offset by higher natural gas and crude oil prices realized in as compared to lower production volumes had a negative impact of million which was partially offset by higher realized prices  excluding hedge activities  which contributed million to natural gas and crude oil revenue for the year ended december  crude oil sales volumes decreased from mbbls in to mbbls during the decrease in crude oil production was primarily due to natural field declines 
natural gas sales volumes decreased from bcf in to bcf in this decrease was primarily due to the sale of properties in live oak county  texas effective august   as well as natural field declines 
properties sold in contributed mmcfe during prior to their sale 
production from a west texas well drilled and brought onto production in august produced bcf in as compared to bcf in the west texas well  the la escalera ah well  provided approximately of our mcfe production for the year ended december  average sales prices in net of hedging were per bbl of crude oil  and per mcf of natural gas 
average sales prices in net of hedging were per bbl of crude oil  and per mcf of natural gas 
we account for hedging gains and losses based on realized and unrealized amounts 
the realized hedge gains or losses are determined by actual hedge settlements during the period 
unrealized gains and losses are based on the periodic mark to market valuation of hedges in place 
our hedge transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting as prescribed by sfas  therefore  fluctuations in the market value of the hedge is recognized in earnings during the current period 
abraxas energy partners has entered into a series of nymex based fixed price commodity swaps  the estimated unearned value of these hedges is approximately million as of december  for the year ended december   we realized a gain on these hedges of million 
as of december  we incurred unrealized losses on hedges in place of million 
lease operating expense and production taxes 
lease operating expense  or loe  decreased from million in to million in the decrease in loe was primarily due to a decrease in ad valorem and severance taxes 
severance and ad valorem taxes decreased from million in to million in the decrease was due to revisions of values of some properties resulting in a lower ad valorem tax assessment 
excluding taxes  loe increased from million in to million in this increase was due to a general increase in the cost of field services 
our loe on a per mcfe basis for the year ended december  was per mcfe compared to per mcfe in the increase on a per mcfe basis was primarily due to a decrease in production volumes in as compared to g a expense 
general and administrative  or g a expense  excluding stock based compensation increased from million in to million in the increase in g a expense in was primarily due to new  incremental g a costs incurred by abraxas energy partners and to higher performance bonuses in as compared to performance bonuses amounted to  in  as compared to million in our g a expense on a per mcfe basis increased from in to in the increase in the per mcfe cost was due to increased g a expense in as compared to as well as decreased production volumes in as compared to stock based compensation 
we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors 
options granted to employees and directors are valued at the date of grant and expense is recognized over the options vesting period 
for the year ended december  and  stock based compensation was approximately  and  respectively 
dd a expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization  or dd a  expense decreased from million in to million in the decrease in dd a was primarily due to increased reserves as of december  as compared to december   as well as a decrease in production volumes in as compared to our dd a expense on a per mcfe basis for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in the increase in the per mcfe basis was due to the decreased production volumes in as compared to interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in compared to million for in the decrease in interest expense was due to the redemption of our outstanding senior secured notes and refinancing and repayment of our credit facility with wells fargo foothill in may loss on debt extinguishments 
the loss on debt extinguishment consists primarily of the call premium and interest that was paid in connection with the refinancing and redemption of our senior secured notes in may income taxes 
federal income tax and state of texas margin tax have been recognized for the year ended december  as a result of the gain on the sale of assets during the period 
no deferred income tax expense or benefit has been recognized due to losses or loss carryforwards and valuation allowance  which has been recorded against such benefits 
gain on sale of assets 
as a result of the transactions related to the formation of abraxas energy partners  abraxas petroleum recognized a gain of million 
this gain was calculated based on the requirements of staff accounting bulletin  topic h based on the fact that the company elected gain treatment as a policy and the transaction met the following criteria there were no additional broad corporate reorganizations contemplated  there was not a reason to believe that the gain would not be realized  since there is no additional capital raising transaction anticipated nor was there a significant concern about the new entity s ability to continue in existence  the share price of capital raised in the private placement was objectively determined  no repurchases of the new subsidiary s units are planned  and the company acknowledges that it will consistently apply the policy  and any future transactions that might result in a loss must be recorded as a loss in the income statement 
minority interest 
minority interest represents the share of the net income loss of abraxas energy partners for the period owned by the partners other than abraxas petroleum 
for the year ended december   the minority interest in the net loss of the partnership was approximately million 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  operating revenue 
during the year ended december   operating revenue from natural gas and crude oil sales increased by million from million in to million in the increase in revenue was primarily due to increased production volumes in as compared to offset by lower natural gas prices realized in as compared to higher production volumes contributed million to natural gas and crude oil revenue  and increased crude oil realized prices contributed million 
lower natural gas prices had a negative impact of million on natural gas and crude oil revenue during crude oil sales volumes increased from mbbls in to mbbls during the increase in crude oil production was primarily due to production from wells in wyoming and south texas that were brought onto production during natural gas sales volumes increased from bcf in to bcf in this increase was primarily due to production from a west texas well drilled and brought onto production in august this well  the la escalera iah well  produced bcf in as compared to bcf in the increase in production was partially offset by natural field declines and the sale of properties in live oak county  texas effective august  these properties produced mmcf in compared to mmcf in through the date of sale 
average sales prices in net of hedging were per bbl of crude oil  and per mcf of natural gas 
average sales prices in net of hedging were per bbl of crude oil  and per mcf of natural gas 
we account for hedging gains and losses based on realized and unrealized amounts 
the realized hedge gains or losses are determined by actual hedge settlements during the period 
unrealized gains and losses are based on the periodic mark to market valuation of hedges in place 
our hedge transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting as prescribed by sfas  therefore  fluctuations in the market value of the hedge is recognized in earnings during the current period 
in and all of our hedges were in the form of price floors  we had realized and unrealized losses of approximately  and  in  compared to realized  and unrealized income of  and  for the year ended december  lease operating expense and production taxes 
lease operating expense  or loe  increased from million in to million in the increase in loe was primarily due to a general increase in the cost of field services 
lower production taxes  due to the lower realized price for natural gas  were offset by increased advalorem taxes related to new wells 
our loe on a per mcfe basis for the year ended december  was per mcfe compared to per mcfe in the decrease on a per mcfe basis was primarily due to increased production volumes in as compared to g a expense 
general and administrative  or g a expense  excluding stock based compensation decreased from million in to million in the decrease in g a expense in was primarily due to higher performance bonuses in as compared to performance bonuses amounted to  in  as compared to  in our g a expense on a per mcfe basis decreased from in to in the decrease in the per mcfe cost was due to decreased g a expense in as compared to as well as increased production volumes in as compared to stock based compensation 
we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors 
options granted to employees and directors are valued at the date of grant and expense is recognized over the options vesting period 
for the year ended december  and  stock based compensation was approximately  and  respectively 
dd a expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization  or dd a  expense increased from million in to million in the increase in dd a was primarily due to increased production volumes in as well as a general increase in drilling and development cost in as compared to the increase in development cost was a result of an increase in estimated future development cost which causes an increase in the depletion base on which depletion is calculated 
our dd a expense on a per mcfe basis for was per mcfe as compared to per mcfe in the increase in the per mcfe basis was due to the increased depletion base as a result of higher estimated future development cost in as compared to  which was partially offset by higher production volumes in interest expense 
interest expense increased from million to million for compared to the increase in interest expense was primarily due to increased interest rates during income from discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations was million in there was no income from discontinued operations in or on february   grey wolf exploration inc completed an ipo resulting in abraxas substantially divesting itself of its investment in grey wolf 
the operations of grey wolf  previously reported as a business segment  are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the accompanying financial statements and the operating results are reflected separately from the results of continuing operations 
income from discontinued operations for the period ended december  included a gain on the disposal of grey wolf of million  net of non cash income tax of million  and a loss from operations  including debt retirement costs  of million 
liquidity and capital resources general 
the natural gas and crude oil industry is a highly capital intensive and cyclical business 
our capital requirements are driven principally by our obligations to service debt and to fund the following costs the development of existing properties  including drilling and completion costs of wells  acquisition of interests in additional natural gas and crude oil properties  and production and transportation facilities 
the amount of capital expenditures we are able to make has a direct impact on our ability to increase cash flow from operations and  thereby  will directly affect our ability to service our debt obligations and to continue to grow the business through the development of existing properties and the acquisition of new properties 
abraxas sources of capital going forward will primarily be cash from operating activities  funding under its credit facility  distributions from the partnership and if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  proceeds from the sale of properties 
we may also seek equity capital although we may not be able to complete any equity financings on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
the partnership s principal sources of capital will be cash from operating activities  borrowings under the partnership credit facility  and sales of debt or equity securities if available to it 
working capital deficit 
at december  our current assets of approximately million exceeded our current liabilities of million resulting in working capital of million 
this compares to a working capital deficit of million as of december  significant components of current liabilities as of december  consisted of trade payables of million  revenues due third parties of million  other accrued liabilities of million and current hedge liabilities of million 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures related to our continuing operations in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the table below sets forth the components of these capital expenditures for the three years ended december  year ended december  dollars in thousands expenditure category exploration development acquisition facilities and other total during  and  capital expenditures were primarily for the development of existing properties and a deposit for the st 
mary property acquisition that closed in january we anticipate making capital expenditures for of million  excluding the cost of the st 
mary property acquisition completed in january these anticipated expenditures are subject to adequate cash flow from operations and availability under our revolving credit facility 
the partnership anticipates making capital expenditures for of million which will be used primarily for the development of its current properties 
these anticipated expenditures are subject to adequate cash flow from operations  availability under abraxas and the partnership s credit facilities and  in abraxas case  distributions of available cash from the partnership 
if these sources of funding do not prove to be sufficient  we may also issue additional shares of equity securities although we may not be able to complete equity financings on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our ability to make all of our budgeted capital expenditures will also be subject to availability of drilling rigs and other field equipment and services 
our capital expenditures could also include expenditures for the acquisition of producing properties if such opportunities arise 
as discussed in business recent events  abraxas energy partners and abraxas petroleum completed the acquisition of certain oil and gas properties on january  additionally  the level of capital expenditures will vary during future periods depending on market conditions and other related economic factors 
should the prices of natural gas and crude oil continue to decline and if our costs of operations continue to increase as a result of the scarcity of drilling rigs or if our production volumes decrease  our cash flows will decrease which may result in a reduction of the capital expenditures budget 
if we decrease our capital expenditures budget  we may not be able to offset natural gas and crude oil production volumes decreases caused by natural field declines and sales of producing properties  if any 
sources of capital 
the net funds provided by and or used in each of the operating  investing and financing activities  related to continuing operations  are summarized in the following table and discussed in further detail below year ended december  dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities total operating activities for the year ended december  provided million in cash compared to providing million in the same period in net income plus non cash expense items and net changes in operating assets and liabilities accounted for most of these funds 
financing activities provided million for the year ended december  compared to using million for the same period of most of the funds provided in were proceeds from the issuance of common stock  proceeds from the sale of common units of the partnership and proceeds from the partnership s and abraxas credit facilities 
in  most of the funds used were for net reductions in long term borrowings from our revolving line of credit 
investing activities used million during the year ended december  compared to using million for the same period of investing activities in included million for the development of our existing properties and million for the st 
mary property acquisition that was completed in january operating activities for the year ended december  provided us with million of cash 
expenditures in of approximately primarily for the development of natural gas and crude oil properties offset by proceeds from the sale of oil and gas properties of million 
financing activities used million during  of which million was provided from long term borrowing offset by million of payments on long term debt 
operating activities for the year ended december  provided us with million of cash 
expenditures in of approximately were primarily for the development of natural gas and crude oil properties 
financing activities provided million during  of which million was provided by a private placement of common stock  million was provided from long term borrowing offset by million of payments on long term debt 
future capital resources 
abraxas sources of capital going forward will primarily be cash from operating activities  funding under the credit facility  cash on hand  distributions from the partnership and if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  proceeds from the sale of properties 
abraxas energy partners principal sources of capital will be cash from operating activities  borrowings under the partnership credit facility  and sales of debt or equity securities if available to it 
our cash flow from operations depends heavily on the prevailing prices of natural gas and crude oil and our production volumes of natural gas and crude oil 
although a significant portion of our consolidated natural gas and crude oil production is hedged  future natural gas and crude oil price declines would have a material adverse effect on our overall results  and therefore  our liquidity 
falling natural gas and crude oil prices could also negatively affect our ability to raise capital on terms favorable to us or at all 
our cash flow from operations will also depend upon the volume of natural gas and crude oil that we produce 
unless we otherwise expand reserves  our production volumes may decline as reserves are produced 
for example  in  abraxas replaced only of the reserves it produced 
in we replaced of the reserves we produced 
in the future  if an appropriate opportunity presents itself  we may sell producing properties  which could further reduce our production volumes 
to offset the loss in production volumes resulting from natural field declines and sales of producing properties  we must conduct successful  exploration and development activities  acquire additional producing properties or identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves 
we believe our numerous drilling opportunities will allow us to increase our production volumes  however  our drilling activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or crude oil reservoirs will be found 
if our proved reserves decline in the future  our production will also decline and  consequently  our cash flow from operations  distributions from the partnership and the amount that we are able to borrow under our credit facilities will also decline 
the risk of not finding commercially productive reservoirs will be compounded by the fact that of abraxas petroleum s and of the partnership s total estimated proved reserves at december  were undeveloped 
during  we expended approximately million for wells in south texas and west texas 
we continue to perform general well maintenance and work overs utilizing our own work over rigs 
in addition  approximately of our mcfe production for the year ended december  was from a single well in west texas 
if production from this well decreases  the volume of our production would also decrease which  in turn  would likely cause our cash flow from operations to decrease 
contractual obligations 
we are committed to making cash payments in the future on the following types of agreements long term debt  and operating leases for office facilities we have no off balance sheet debt or unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
below is a schedule of the future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  payments due in contractual obligations dollars in thousands total thereafter long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases total these amounts represent the balances outstanding under the partnership revolving credit facility 
these repayments assume that we will not draw down additional funds 
interest expense assumes the balances of long term debt at the end of the period and current effective interest rates 
office lease obligations 
the lease for office space expires in january we maintain a reserve for cost associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
at december  our reserve for these obligations totaled million for which no contractual commitment exist 
for additional information relating to this obligation  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements 
at december   we had no existing off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec regulations  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
contingencies 
from time to time  we are involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business 
at december  we were not engaged in any legal proceedings that are expected  individually or in the aggregate  to have a material adverse effect on the company 
other obligations 
we make and will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  exploration  development and production of crude oil and natural gas 
in the past  we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations  sales of properties  sales of production payments and borrowings under our bank credit facilities and other sources 
given our high degree of operating control  the timing and incurrence of operating and capital expenditures is largely within our discretion 
long term indebtedness long term indebtedness consisted of the following december  december  floating rate senior secured notes due senior secured revolving credit facility partnership credit facility credit facility less current maturities floating rate senior secured notes due in october  abraxas issued million in principal aggregate amount of floating rate senior secured notes due thenotes were refinanced and redeemed with the proceeds from the refinancing transactions consummated in may senior secured revolving credit facility 
in october  abraxas entered into an agreement for a revolving credit facility having a maximum commitment of million  which included a million sub facility for letters of credit 
this facility was refinanced and terminated in may new abraxas senior secured credit facility 
on june   abraxas entered into a new senior secured revolving credit facility  which we refer to as the credit facility 
the credit facility has a maximum commitment of million 
availability under the credit facility is subject to a borrowing base 
the borrowing base under the credit facility  which is currently million  is determined semi annually by the lenders based upon our reserve reports  one of which must be prepared by our independent petroleum engineers and one of which may be prepared internally 
the amount of the borrowing base is calculated by the lenders based upon their valuation of our proved reserves utilizing these reserve reports and their own internal decisions 
in addition  the lenders  in their sole discretion  may make one additional borrowing base redetermination during any six month period between scheduled redeterminations and we may also request one redetermination during any six month period between scheduled redeterminations 
the lenders may also make a redetermination in connection with any sales of producing properties with a market value of or more of our current borrowing base 
our borrowing base at december  of million was determined based upon our reserves at december  after giving effect to the contribution of properties to the partnership in may our borrowing base can never exceed the million maximum commitment amount

abraxas is permitted to terminate the credit facility  and may  from time to time  permanently reduce the lenders aggregate commitment under the credit facility in compliance with certain notice and dollar increment requirements 
each of abraxas subsidiaries other than the partnership  abraxas general partner  llc and abraxas energy investments  llc has guaranteed abraxas obligations under the credit facility on a senior secured basis 
obligations under the credit facility are secured by a first priority perfected security interest  subject to certain permitted encumbrances  in all of abraxas and the subsidiary guarantors material property and assets 
under the credit facility  abraxas is subject to customary covenants  including certain financial covenants and reporting requirements 
the credit facility requires abraxas to maintain a minimum current ratio as of the last day of each quarter of not less than to and an interest coverage ratio generally defined as the ratio of consolidated ebitda to consolidated interest expense as of the last day of such quarter of not less than to 
in addition to the foregoing and other customary covenants  the credit facility contains a number of covenants that  among other things  will restrict abraxas ability to incur or guarantee additional indebtedness  transfer or sell assets  create liens on assets  engage in transactions with affiliates other than on an arms length basis  make any change in the principal nature of its business  and permit a change of control 
the credit facility also contains customary events of default  including nonpayment of principal or interest  violations of covenants  cross default and cross acceleration to certain other indebtedness  bankruptcy and material judgments and liabilities 
amended and restated partnership credit facility 
on may   the partnership entered into a senior secured revolving credit facility which was amended and restated on january   which we refer to as the partnership credit facility 
the partnership credit facility has a maximum commitment of million 
availability under the partnership credit facility is subject to a borrowing base 
the borrowing base under the partnership credit facility  which is currently million  is determined semi annually by the lenders based upon the partnership s reserve reports  one of which must be prepared by the partnership s independent petroleum engineers and one of which may be prepared internally 
the amount of the borrowing base is calculated by the lenders based upon their valuation of the partnership s proved reserves utilizing these reserve reports and their own internal decisions 
in addition  the lenders  in their sole discretion  may make one additional borrowing base redetermination during any six month period between scheduled redeterminations 
the lenders may also make a redetermination in connection with any sales of producing properties with a market value of or more of the partnership s current borrowing base 
the partnership s current borrowing base of million was determined based upon its reserves at june  and the reserves attributable to the oil and gas properties acquired from st 
mary land exploration company on january  the borrowing base can never exceed the million maximum commitment amount 
outstanding amounts under the partnership credit facility bear interest at the reference rate announced from time to time by soci t g n rale plus

hedging activities our results of operations are significantly affected by fluctuations in commodity prices and we seek to reduce our exposure to price volatility by hedging our production through swaps  options and other commodity derivative instruments 
under our revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain hedge positions on not less than or more than of our projected oil and gas production for a six month rolling period 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk hedging sensitivity for further information 
net operating loss carryforwards at december   we had  subject to the limitation discussed below  million of net operating loss carryforwards for us tax purposes 
these loss carryforwards will expire through if not utilized 
uncertainties exist as to the future utilization of the operating loss carryforwards under the criteria set forth under fasb statement no 
therefore  we have established a valuation allowance of million and million for deferred tax assets at december  and  respectively

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the following represents those policies that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain 
full cost method of accounting for natural gas and crude oil activities 
sec regulation s x defines the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in natural gas and crude oil activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
we have chosen to follow the full cost method under which all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development are capitalized 
we also capitalize internal costs that can be directly identified with our acquisition  exploration and development activities and do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
under the successful efforts method  geological and geophysical costs and costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties are charged to expense as incurred 
costs of drilling exploratory wells that do not result in proved reserves are charged to expense 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment of natural gas and crude oil properties are generally calculated on a well by well or lease or field basis versus the full cost pool basis 
additionally  gain or loss is generally recognized on all sales of natural gas and crude oil properties under the successful efforts method 
as a result our financial statements will differ from companies that apply the successful efforts method since we will generally reflect a higher level of capitalized costs as well as a higher depreciation  depletion and amortization rate on our natural gas and crude oil properties 
at the time it was adopted  management believed that the full cost method would be preferable  as earnings tend to be less volatile than under the successful efforts method 
however  the full cost method makes us susceptible to significant non cash charges during times of volatile commodity prices because the full cost pool may be impaired when prices are low 
these charges are not recoverable when prices return to higher levels 
we have experienced this situation several times over the years  most recently in our natural gas and crude oil reserves have a relatively long life 
however  temporary drops in commodity prices can have a material impact on our business including impact from the full cost method of accounting 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized cost of natural gas and crude oil properties may not exceed a ceiling limit which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves on a pool by pool basis  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties and the cost of properties not being amortized  less income taxes 
if net capitalized costs of natural gas and crude oil properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings 
this is called a ceiling limitation write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce our stockholders equity and reported earnings 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of natural gas and crude oil properties increases when natural gas and crude oil prices are depressed or volatile 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves or if purchasers cancel long term contracts for our natural gas production 
an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher natural gas and crude oil prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 
we apply the full cost ceiling test on a quarterly basis on the date of the latest balance sheet presented 
estimates of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves 
estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
our proved reserve information included in this report was based on evaluations prepared by independent petroleum engineers 
estimates prepared by other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
you should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of our estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
the estimates of proved reserves materially impact dd a expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
asset retirement obligations 
the estimated costs of restoration and removal of facilities are accrued 
the fair value of a liability for an asset s retirement obligation is recorded in the period in which it is incurred and the corresponding cost capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its then present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
for all periods presented  we have included estimated future costs of abandonment and dismantlement in our full cost amortization base and amortize these costs as a component of our depletion expense 
hedge accounting 
from time to time  we use commodity price hedges to limit our exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices 
results of those hedging transactions are reflected in natural gas and crude oil sales 
statement of financial accounting standards  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  was effective for us on january  sfas  as amended and interpreted  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
in we elected out of hedge accounting as prescribed by sfas accordingly all derivatives  whether designated in hedging relationships or not  are required to be recorded at fair value on our balance sheet 
changes in fair value of contracts are recognized in earnings in the current period 
due to the volatility of natural gas and crude oil prices and  to a lesser extent  interest rates  our financial condition and results of operations can be significantly impacted by changes in the market value of our derivative instruments 
as of december  and the net market value of our derivatives was an asset of  and a liability of million  respectively 
share based payments 
we currently utilize a standard option pricing model ie  black scholes to measure the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors 
options granted to employees and directors are valued at the date of grant and expense is recognized over the options vesting period 
for the years ended december   and  stock based compensation was approximately   and  respectively 
new accounting pronouncements fair value measurements sfas no 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which provides a single definition of fair value  together with a framework for measuring it  and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets 
fair value measurements are disclosed by level within that hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the fasb agreed to defer the effective date of statement for one year for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
there is no deferral for financial assets and financial liabilities 
we are evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on the consolidated financial statements and do not expect the impact of implementation to be material 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which provides companies with an option to measure  at specified election dates  many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value 
a company that adopts sfas no 
will report unrealized gains and losses on items  for which the fair value option has been elected  in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
this statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the implementation of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
business combinations sfas no 
revised in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  which establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest  recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no 
r is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins on or after december  we are evaluating the impact of sfas no 
r on our consolidated financial statements for any potential business combinations subsequent to january  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which establishes accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership interest in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified and presented in the consolidated balance sheets within equity  but separate from the parent s equity  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of earnings  and changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we are evaluating the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk as an independent natural gas and crude oil producer  our revenue  cash flow from operations  other income and equity earnings and profitability  reserve values  access to capital and future rate of growth are substantially dependent upon the prevailing prices of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids 
declines in commodity prices will adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas and crude oil that we can produce economically 
prevailing prices for such commodities are subject to wide fluctuation in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors beyond our control  such as global political and economic conditions 
historically  prices received for natural gas and crude oil production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such volatility is expected to continue 
most of our production is sold at market prices 
generally  if the commodity indexes fall  the price that we receive for our production will also decline 
therefore  the amount of revenue that we realize is partially determined by factors beyond our control 
assuming the production levels we attained during the year ended december   a decline in natural gas and crude oil  prices would have reduced our operating revenue and cash flow by approximately million for the year 
hedging sensitivity on january   we adopted sfas as amended by sfas and sfas under sfas  all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative is recognized currently in earnings 
to qualify for hedge accounting  the derivative must qualify either as a fair value hedge  cash flow hedge or foreign currency hedge 
none of the derivatives in place as of december  are designated as qualifying hedges under sfas accordingly  the change in the market value of the instrument is reflected in current oil and gas revenue 
see general commodity prices and hedging activities for a summary of current hedge positions of the partnership 
interest rate risk at december   we had million in outstanding indebtedness under the partnership credit facility 
outstanding amounts under the partnership credit facility bear interest at a the greater of the reference rate announced from time to time by soci t g n rale  and the federal funds rate plus  plus in each case  b to depending on utilization of the borrowing base  or  if the partnership elects  at the london interbank offered rate plus to  depending on the utilization of the borrowing base 
at december   the interest rate on the facility was 
for every percentage point that the libor rate rises  our interest expense would increase by approximately  on an annual basis
