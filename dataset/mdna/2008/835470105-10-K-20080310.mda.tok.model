references to we  our  and us refer to sonicwall  inc and its subsidiaries 
overview sonicwall provides network security  content security  and business continuity solutions for businesses of all sizes 
our solutions are typically deployed at the edges of networks 
these networks are often aggregated into broader distributed deployments to support companies that do business in multiple physical locations  interconnect their networks with trading partners  or support a mobile or remote workforce 
our solutions are sold in over countries worldwide 
we generate revenue primarily from the sale of products  software licenses  subscriptions for services such as content filtering  anti virus protection and intrusion prevention  offsite data backup  email protection  and other services such as extended warranty and service contracts  training  consulting and engineering services 
we currently outsource our hardware manufacturing and assembly to contract manufacturers 
our primary contract manufacturer flash electronics manufactures and assembles many of our products 
we also have certain contract manufacturers in taiwan who manufacture and assemble certain of our products at their taiwan facilities 
outsourcing our manufacturing and assembly enables us to reduce fixed overhead and personnel costs and to provide flexibility in meeting market demand 

table of contents we design and develop the key components for the majority of our products 
in addition  we generally determine the components that are incorporated in our products and select the appropriate suppliers of these components 
product testing and burn in are performed by our contract manufacturer using tests that we typically specify 
we sell our solutions primarily through distributors and value added resellers  who in turn sell our products to end users 
some of our resellers are carriers or service providers who provide solutions to the end user customers as managed services 
we seek to provide our channel partners and customers with differentiated solutions that are innovative  easy to use  reliable  and provide good value 
to support this commitment  we dedicate significant resources to developing new products and marketing our products to our channel partners and customers 
key success factors of our business we believe that there are several key success factors of our business  and that we create value in our business by focusing on our execution in these areas 
channel our distributors and authorized resellers provide a valuable service in assisting end users in the design  implementation  and service of our network security  content security  and business continuity solutions 
we support our distribution and channel partners with sales  marketing  and technical support to help them create and fulfill demand for our offerings 
we also focus on helping our channel partners succeed with our solutions by concentrating on comprehensive reseller training and certification  and support for our channel s sales activities 
product and service platform our products serve as a platform for revenue generation for both us and our channel partners 
most product sales can result in additional revenue through the simultaneous or subsequent acquisition of software licenses  such as our global management system  or through the sale of additional value added subscription services  such as content filtering  client anti virus and integrated gateway anti virus  anti spyware and intrusion prevention services  email protection and off site data backup 
distributed architecture our security solutions are based on a distributed architecture  which we believe allows our offerings to be deployed and managed at the most efficient location in the network 
we are providing our customers and their service providers with mechanisms to enforce the networking and security policies they have defined for their business 
we also use the flexibility of a distributed architecture to allow us to enable new functionality in already deployed platforms through the provisioning of an electronic key  which may be distributed through the internet 
market acceptance we began offering integrated security appliances in  and since that time we have shipped over million revenue units 
when measured by units shipped  we are typically among the top three suppliers in the markets in which we compete 
our experience in serving a broad market and our installed base of customers provides us with opportunities to sell our new network security  content security  and business continuity solutions as they become available 
the market acceptance of our current solutions provides our current and prospective channel partners with an increased level of comfort when deciding to offer our new solutions to their customers 
integrated design our platforms utilize a highly integrated design in order to improve ease of use  lower acquisition and operational costs for our customers  and enhance performance 
various models also integrate functionality to support different internet connection alternatives 
every appliance also ships with pre loaded firmware to provide for rapid set up and easy installation 
each of these tasks can be managed through a simple web browser session 

table of contents our opportunities  challenges  and risks we serve substantial and growing markets for network security  content security  and business continuity 
our goal is to deliver comprehensive and profitable solutions to our channel partners which address their customers needs 
we pursue the creation of these solutions through a blend of organic and inorganic growth strategies including internal development efforts  licensing and oem opportunities  and acquisition of other companies 
to the extent that these efforts result in solutions which fit well with our channel and end users  we would expect to generate increasing sales 
to the extent that these efforts are not successful  we would expect to see loss of sales and or increased expenses without commensurate return 
international growth we expect that international revenue will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue in the foreseeable future 
our percentage of sales from international territories does not represent the same degree of penetration of those markets as we have achieved domestically 
we believe that a significant opportunity exists to grow our revenue by increasing our international penetration rate to match our penetration rate in the domestic market 
if we fail to structure our distribution relationships in a manner consistent with marketplace requirements and on favorable terms  the percentage of sales from international territories will decline and the revenue from our international operations may decrease 
growth in enterprises we believe that sales through our indirect channel to larger end customers represents a growth opportunity for the company 
our percentage of revenues from such customers does not represent the same degree of penetration of that segment as we have achieved with small to medium sized businesses 
we believe that a significant opportunity exists to grow our revenue by increasing our penetration rate with this segment by leveraging the company s technological and channel strengths 
if we fail to establish competitive products and services for this segment  or fail to develop the correct channel partners and resources  the percentage of our revenue derived from larger end customers will not increase  and may  in fact  decrease 
license and services revenue we believe that the software license and services component of our revenue has several characteristics that are positive for our business as a whole our license and services revenue is associated with a higher gross profit than our product revenue  the subscription services component of license and services revenue is recognized ratably over the services period  and thus provides  in the aggregate  a more predictable revenue stream than product or license revenue  which are generally recognized at the time of the sale  and to the extent that we are able to achieve good renewal rates  we have the opportunity to lower our selling and marketing expenses attributable to that segment 
we have increased the rate at which we have been able to sell our services to both our installed base and in conjunction with our new solution sales 
as a result  we have been able to generate incremental revenue out of each product transaction 
we expect the percentage of our total revenue from software licenses and services to continue to grow 
however  should we not achieve reasonable rates of selling services to our installed base or as part of new solution sales  or realize lower subscription service renewal rates  we risk having our revenue concentrated in more unpredictable product and license sales 
macro economic factors affecting it spending we believe that our products and services are subject to the macro economic factors that affect much of the information technology it market 
growing it budgets and an increased funding for projects to provide security  mobility  data protection  and productivity could drive product upgrade cycles and or create demand for new applications of our solutions 
contractions in it spending can affect our revenue by causing projects incorporating our products and services to be delayed and or canceled 
we believe that demand for our solutions correlate with increases or decreases in global it spending and we believe that current economic uncertainties in the united states and elsewhere may have an adverse impact on it spending in the markets in which we do business 
critical accounting policies and critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we believe that the judgments  assumptions  and estimates upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these judgments  
table of contents assumptions  and estimates are made 
however  any differences between these judgments  assumptions  and estimates and actual results could have a material impact on our statement of operations and financial condition 
the accounting policies that reflect our most significant judgments  assumptions  and estimates and which we believe are critical in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include revenue recognition  sales returns and other allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts  and warranty reserve  valuation of inventory  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and share based compensation 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenue primarily from the sale of products  software licenses  subscriptions for services such as content filtering  email security  client anti virus and integrated gateway anti virus  anti spyware  and intrusion prevention services  and other services such as extended warranty and service contracts  training  consulting and engineering services 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
the company may experience material differences in the amount and timing of its revenue for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
the company recognizes product and service revenues in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and all related amendments and interpretations 
the company applies provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition sop no 
 and all related amendments and interpretations  to all transactions involving the sale of hardware products that include software solutions 
the company recognizes revenue for products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
while the company s sales agreements contain standard terms and conditions  there are agreements that contain non standard terms and conditions 
in these cases  interpretation of non standard provisions is required to determine the appropriate accounting for the transaction 
retroactive price protection rights resulting from price reductions on products previously sold to customers are contractually offered to the company s channel partners 
the company evaluates the revenue impact of these rights carefully based on stock on hand in the channels with the exception of ingram micro and tech data 
revenue from these two distributors is not recognized until they sell the product to their customers 
as a consequence  there is no adverse impact on recognized revenue 
in general  retroactive price adjustments are infrequent in nature 
at december    and  the company recorded a provision for price protection on sales to the company s channel partners in the amounts of   and  respectively 
delivery to customers is generally deemed to occur when we deliver the product to a common carrier 
certain distributor agreements provide customers with rights of return for stock rotation 
these stock rotation rights are generally limited to to of the distributor s purchases over the immediately preceding to months period or other measurable restrictions  and we estimate reserves for these return rights as discussed below 
two of our largest distributors  ingram micro and tech data  have rights of return under certain circumstances that are not limited  therefore  we do not deem delivery to have occurred for any sales to ingram micro and tech data until they sell the product to their customers 
evidence of an arrangement is manifested by a master distribution or oem agreement  an individual binding purchase order  or a signed license agreement 
in most cases  sales through our distributors and oem partners are governed by a master agreement against which individual binding purchase orders are placed on a transaction by transaction basis 
at the time of the transaction  the company assesses whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable  and whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
the company assesses whether the fee is fixed or determinable based upon the terms of the binding purchase order  including the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due beyond the company s normal payment terms  which are generally to days from invoice date  the company accounts for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  the company recognizes revenue as the fees become due 
the company assesses probability of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with and the credit worthiness of the customer 
the company does not request collateral from its customers 
if the company determines that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  it defers the fee and recognizes revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 

table of contents for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  the sale of an appliance which includes a year of maintenance or a subscription based product  the company allocates revenue to each component of the arrangement based on the objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements  which is generally the average selling price of each element when sold separately 
this allocation process means that the company defers revenue from the arrangement equal to the fair value of the undelivered elements and recognizes such amounts as revenue when the elements are delivered 
the company s arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  recognition of revenue occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
the company recognizes revenue for subscriptions and services such as content filtering  anti virus protection and intrusion prevention  and extended warranty and service contracts  ratably over the contract term 
the company s training  consulting and engineering services are generally billed and recognized as revenue as these services are performed 
the company collects and remits sales taxes on products and services that it purchases and sells under its contracts with customers  and reports such amounts under the net method in its consolidated statements of operations 
accordingly  there are no sales taxes included in revenue 
sales returns and other allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts  and warranty reserve the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  we must make estimates of potential future product returns and price changes related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
we may experience material differences in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
in addition  we must make estimates based upon a combination of factors to ensure that our accounts receivable balances are not overstated due to uncollectibility 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  the length of time receivables are past due  macroeconomic conditions  deterioration in customer s operating results or financial position  customer concentrations  and customer credit worthiness  when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
our appliance products are generally covered by a warranty period of one to two years 
we accrue a warranty reserve for estimated costs to provide warranty services  including the cost of technical support  product repairs  and product replacement for units that cannot be repaired 
our estimate of costs to fulfill our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty accrual will increase  resulting in decreased gross profit 
valuation of inventory we continually assess the valuation of our inventory and periodically write down the value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
such estimates are difficult to make since they are based  in part  on estimates of current and future economic conditions 
reviews for excess inventory are done on a quarterly basis and required reserve levels are calculated with reference to our projected ultimate usage of that inventory 
in order to determine the ultimate usage  we take into account forecasted demand  rapid technological changes  product life cycles  projected obsolescence  current inventory levels  and purchase commitments 
the excess balance determined by this analysis becomes the basis for our excess inventory charge 
if actual demand is lower than our forecasted demand  and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly  we could be required to record additional inventory write downs  which would have a negative effect on our gross profit and earnings 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of 
table of contents recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties related to these uncertain tax positions 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
in the first quarter of  we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
fin  and related guidance see note income taxes in part ii  item of this form k 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed in the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill purchased intangibles consist of purchased technology  customer installed base relationships  customer backlog and other intangibles 
intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from months to eight years 
we periodically evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period  we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair market value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired by the company 
goodwill is tested for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more often if an event or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss has been incurred 
an impairment charge is recognized if a reporting unit s goodwill carrying amount exceeds its implied fair value 
goodwill impairment is determined using a two step approach in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets using one or more of the following fair value measures including present value techniques of estimated future cash flows  or valuation techniques based on multiples of earnings or revenue  or a similar performance measure 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial statements 
based on the impairment tests performed  there was no impairment of goodwill in   and the goodwill recorded as a result of the business combinations in the years presented is not deductible for tax purposes 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets  including intangible assets  may not be recoverable 
when such events or changes in circumstances occur  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets will be recovered through undiscounted expected future cash flows 
if the total of the future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of those assets  we record an impairment charge based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
share based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation revised sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to the employee stock purchase plan employee stock purchases based on estimated fair values 
sfas 
table of contents r supersedes our previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb for periods beginning in fiscal in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to sfas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of the company s fiscal year the company s consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december  and december  reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
share based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the year ended december  was million which consisted of share based compensation expense related to employee stock options in the amount of million and expense related to employee stock plan purchases in the amount of  share based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the year ended december  was million which consisted of share based compensation expense related to employee stock options in the amount of million and expense related to employee stock plan purchases in the amount of  the total compensation cost gross related to non vested awards not yet recognized at december  was million and the weighted average period over which this amount is expected to be recognized is years 
see note for additional information on share based compensation 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and december   are based on awards ultimately expected to vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
share based compensation expense recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and december  included compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas and compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  the company continued to use the straight line single option method 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in the company s pro forma information required under sfas for the periods prior to fiscal  the company accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
upon adoption of sfas r  the company continued to use the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model which was previously used for the company s pro forma information required under sfas for additional information  see note the company s determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
because the company s employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly different from traded options  and because changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimated value  in management s opinion  the existing valuation models may not provide an accurate measure of the fair value of the company s employee stock options 
although the fair value of employee stock options is determined in accordance with sfas r and sab using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction

table of contents commercialization of acquired technologies carries a significant risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and significant competitive threats 
the nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning  designing  experimenting  and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results

we expect new products to be a continuing source of additional revenue 
license and service revenue license and service revenue is derived primarily from licensing of software products  such as our global management system  enhancements to our sonicos operating system  node upgrades  email security license  and site to site back up licenses  and sales of subscription services such as content filtering  email security  client anti virus  integrated gateway anti virus  anti spyware  and intrusion prevention  and extended service contracts  and professional services related to training  consulting  and engineering services 
we have experienced significant year over year growth in license and services revenue and expect the market opportunity for our license and subscription service offerings to grow as customer awareness around the dynamic requirements of unified network threat prevention and management becomes more pervasive 
in addition  there is an opportunity to sell subscription service offerings in conjunction with our product offerings in continuous data protection and email security and to our installed base of customers in the form of renewals of existing contracts along with additional services

table of contents the fair value of the existing purchased technology  as well as the technology under development  is determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the discount rate used in the present value calculation was derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
we consider this pricing model for acquired products and technology to be standard within the high technology internet security industry 
we do not expect to achieve a material amount of expense reductions as a result of integrating the acquired in process technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions do not include significant anticipated cost savings 
the key assumptions underlying the valuation of our aventail purchase acquisition for which in process research and development was recorded were as follows estimated cost to complete technology at time of acquisition was approximately million  and risk adjusted discount rate of 
other key assumptions include an expected completion date of approximately one year and revenue and expense projections  assuming that the product has entered the market

the available positive evidence at december   included three years of cumulative historical operating profits  a projection of future income sufficient to realize most of the remaining deferred tax assets  and other evidence 
we recorded a partial valuation allowance release of million in fiscal year  because as of december   it was considered more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized with the exception of certain acquired net operating losses due to the annual change in ownership limitation required by the internal revenue code of  as amended 
we do not forecast future income beyond a year time horizon to determine if these deferred tax assets can be realized 
the remaining valuation allowance of approximately million as of december   will result in a credit to goodwill if and when we conclude it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized

the cumulative effect of the utilization of acquired company deferred tax assets resulted in a reduction in goodwill

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  we classified our short term investments as available for sale 
consequently  investments are recorded on the balance sheet at the fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments included money markets securities  auction rate securities  asset backed securities  corporate bonds  and commercial papers which are generally subject to no interest rate risk when held to maturity  but may increase or decrease in value if interest rates change prior to maturity 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as stated in our investment policy  we are adverse to principal loss and further the goal of preservation of our invested funds by limiting default and market risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only investment grade instruments 
as of december   we do not have any derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the majority of our short term investments maturing in more than one year are readily tradable in to days 
due to this factor and the short duration of the balance of our investment portfolio  we believe an immediate change in interest rates would be immaterial to our financial condition or results of operations 
principal amounts by expected year of maturity in us dollars as of december  are as follows in thousands  except percentages maturing in thereafter total fair value corporate debt securities weighted average interest rate us government securities weighted average interest rate auction rate securities weighted average interest rate total marketable securities foreign currency risk we consider our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
we invoice substantially all of our foreign customers from the united states in us dollars and substantially all revenue is collected in us dollars 
for the year ended december   we earned approximately of our revenue from international markets 
we may  in the future  denominate these transactions in various local currencies 
because our sales are currently denominated in us dollars  the weakness of a foreign country s currency against the dollar could increase the price of our products in such country and reduce our product unit sales by making our products more expensive in the local currency 
a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses and procurement of raw materials to the extent we must purchase components in foreign currencies 
additionally  we have exposures to emerging market currencies  which can have extreme currency volatility 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in the exchange rates of some currencies in relation to the us dollar and diverging economic conditions in foreign markets in which we do business 
we have minimal cash balances denominated in foreign currencies

table of contents financial market risk included within our investment portfolio at december  were auction rate securities that we purchased for million whose underlying assets are primarily student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
these auction rate securities are currently rated aaa  the highest rating  by a rating agency 
these investments failed to trade at recent auctions due to insufficient bids from buyers 
while we now earn a premium interest rate on these auction rate securities  the investments cannot be quickly converted into cash 
our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our investment without significant loss within the next year  and we currently believe these securities are not significantly impaired  primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying securities  however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments recorded value 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  the fair value of those auction rate securities may continue to decline and we may record other than temporary impairment charges 
the credit and capital markets have continued to deteriorate in if uncertainties in these markets continue  these markets deteriorate further or the company experiences any rating downgrades on any investments in its portfolio  the company may incur impairment charges to its investment portfolio  which could negatively affect the company s financial condition  cash flow and reported earnings
