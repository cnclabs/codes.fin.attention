item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  and other financial data included elsewhere herein 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
executive summary we are in the business of owning and operating thirteen timeshare resorts as of december  our income is derived principally from marketing and selling timeshare interests at our resorts in one week intervals and from the interest earned from financed sales of such timeshare interests 
as of december   we have seven getaway resorts located within to hours of major metropolitan areas  which are the primary market for timeshare sales to new purchasers 
our six destination resorts are located farther from major metropolitan areas 
the principal purchasers of timeshare interests at the destination resorts are existing owners who are upgrading or buying additional interests 

table of contents the following economic or industry wide factors are relevant to us we predominantly sell vacation and recreational products to customers who drive to our locations 
we believe that this type of usage is somewhat immune from issues that would affect the travel industry as a whole ie  the disruptions to the airline industry and destination resort industry after september  
however  major increases in gasoline prices or other issues that cause the u 
s population to drive less could have a negative impact on us 
telemarketing is a very important element in the generation of tours to potential new customers of timeshare interests 
we presently comply with state and national do not call regulations 
changes to existing regulations could have a negative impact on our ability to generate the necessary tours to sell timeshare interests 
we finance the majority of our sales over seven to ten years 
an economic downturn could negatively affect the ability of our customers to pay their principal and interest  which might result in additional estimated uncollectible revenue 
our fixed to floating debt ratio is fixed and floating 
although interest rates have recently been trending downward  an increase in interest rates on our variable rate facilities could have a negative impact on our profitability 
since we predominantly finance our sales of timeshare interests  we require credit facilities to have the liquidity necessary to fund our day to day costs and expenses 
we presently have adequate credit facilities to fund our operations through january a disruption in the availability of credit facilities would severely impact our ability to continue marketing and selling timeshare interests as we do today 
we believe there are three areas which are particularly important to our success as a business identifying potential customers who are likely to pay their principal and interest payments when due after purchasing timeshare intervals  thereby resulting in an acceptable level of estimated uncollectible revenue 
maintaining sales and marketing expenses at an acceptable level to result in a favorable percentage relationship between sales and marketing expense and vacation interval sales 
maintaining adequate credit facilities to finance our operations and support the borrowings that are required for our liquidity and continued growth 
we earn revenue and income and finance our operations as follows our primary source of revenue is vacation interval sales 
vacation interval sales are a combination of sales to new customers and upgrade and or additional week sales to existing customers 
we have been focusing on increasing the percentage mix of sales to existing customers in recent years 
in addition  we have been focusing on identifying potential new customers who have more favorable credit characteristics and will ultimately be more likely to pay principal and interest on their timeshare notes when due 
to manage sales  we separately assess sales to potential new customers and sales to existing customers as different factors affect these types of sales 
for example  for sales to potential new customers  we measure sales per tour in order to ascertain that our marketing programs are delivering the proper types of family tours to effectively and efficiently generate sales and we closely monitor rescission rates 
however  the number of tours to existing customers is not meaningful and their rescission rates on incremental sales are much lower 
one product that is sold to new customers is a sampler  which gives the customer the right to use the resorts on an as available basis from sunday to thursday 
revenues related to sampler contracts  which entitle the prospective owner to sample a resort during certain periods  have been and will continue to be deferred until the customer uses the stay or allows the contract to expire 
effective january   sampler sales and related costs are accounted for as incidental operations  whereby incremental costs in excess of related incremental revenues are charged to expense as incurred 
conversely  incremental revenues in excess of related incremental costs are recorded as a reduction of inventory in the consolidated balance sheet 
incremental costs include costs that would not have been incurred had we not sold samplers 
during the years ended december  and  all sampler sales were recorded as a reduction to sales and marketing expense since direct and incremental costs of sampler sales exceeded incremental sampler revenues 
the reduction to sales and marketing expense related to sampler sales in and was million and million  respectively 
prior to sfas no 
 sampler sales were reported separately as revenue 
we recognized million in revenues from sampler sales for the year ended december  
table of contents the following table shows the elements management considers important to assessing our vacation interval sales in thousands  except for tours and sales per tour year ended december  tours to potential new purchasers sales per tour gross sales to new customers rescissions of sales to new customers net sales to new customers gross sales to existing customers rescissions of sales to existing customers net sales to existing customers total sales less sampler sales total vacation interval sales rescission rate for new customers rescission rate for existing customers rescission rate for all customers in assessing the effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs  we believe it is also important to compare sales and marketing expenses to vacation interval sales 
the separate elements of sales and marketing expense that we assess are the cost of marketing to new purchasers  the cost of marketing to existing purchasers  offsite marketing  commissions  and sales and marketing overhead  as detailed in the following table in thousands  except for tours and cost per tour year ended december  tours to potential new purchasers cost per tour cost of marketing to new purchasers cost of marketing to existing purchasers offsite marketing commissions sales and marketing overhead sampler sales offset total sales and marketing expense as a percentage of vacation interval sales cost of marketing to new purchasers cost of marketing to existing purchasers offsite marketing commissions sales and marketing overhead sampler sales offset total sales and marketing expense our second most important source of revenue is interest income  which is predominantly earned on our notes receivable 
interest income as a percentage of average annual notes receivable has increased each year from through as a result of periodically increasing the interest rate we charged our new customers 
we have three lesser revenue sources 
they are management fees  predominantly from silverleaf club  gains on sales of notes receivable to our off balance sheet special purpose entity  and other income 
gains on sales of notes receivable were million for the year ended december  we did not have any gains on sales of notes receivable in the years or we generate cash from the collection of down payments  principal and interest from timeshare notes receivable  from sales of notes receivable  and from management fees and other income 
we also generated cash during each of the last three years from the sale of undeveloped land at locations that had been previously acquired for the possible development of new resorts 
since the majority of our sales are financed  we have revolving credit facilities that are drawn upon monthly to fund our day to day costs  expenses  and capital expenditures 

table of contents we operate principally in only one business segment  the timeshare industry 
further  we only operate in the united states 
as of december   we operate resorts in six states texas  missouri  illinois  massachusetts  georgia  and florida  and sell primarily to residents of those states  with limited sales to residents of nearby states 
in addition  we own and operate a hotel located near the winter park recreational area in colorado which provides our owners with another destination vacation alternative and gives silverleaf an entry point into this increasingly popular destination area 
our principal short term focus is on continuing to conservatively increase annual revenues 
we will continue to identify new and existing customers with acceptable credit characteristics that will allow us to profitably sell new  upgrade  and additional vacation intervals at our existing resorts 
long term  if the opportunities present themselves  we will consider adding and developing new resorts where timeshare intervals can be marketed and sold at a profit 
critical accounting policies adoption of sfas no 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for real estate time sharing transactions sfas no 
 effective january  however  such adoption did not result in recognition of a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as the impact on our results of operations for periods prior to january  was not material 
sfas no 
amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  to apply the financial accounting and reporting guidance for real estate time sharing transactions provided in american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for real estate time sharing transactions sop 
sfas no 
further amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects sfas no 
 to stipulate that guidance provided for a incidental operations and b costs incurred to sell real estate projects under sfas no 
be governed by sop as it relates to real estate time sharing transactions 
in general  sfas no 
provides guidance on determining revenue recognition for timeshare transactions  evaluation of uncollectibility of vacation interval receivables  accounting for costs of vacation interval sales  accounting for operations during holding periods or incidental operations  and other accounting transactions specific to timeshare operations 
restatement or reclassification of previously reported financial statements is not permitted 
accordingly  as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 our financial statements for periods beginning on or after january  are not comparable  in all respects  with those prepared for periods ending on or prior to december  revenue and expense recognition including cost of sales a substantial portion of vacation interval sales are consummated in exchange for mortgage notes receivable  which are secured by a deed of trust on the vacation interval sold 
if development costs related to a particular project or phase are complete  we recognize related vacation interval sales under the full accrual method after a binding sales contract has been executed  the buyer has made a down payment of at least  and the statutory rescission period has expired 
if all such criteria are met yet significant development costs remain to complete the project or phase  revenues are recognized on the percentage of completion basis 
under this method  once the sales criteria are met  revenues are recognized proportionate to costs already incurred relative to total costs expected for the project or phase 
as of december    in unearned vacation interval sales related to deferral of sales recognition under the percentage of completion method 
both of these revenue recognition methods employ the relative sales value method in determining related cost of sales and inventory applicable to each vacation interval sale recognized 
under the relative sales value method  a cost of sales percentage is used to apply costs to related sales as follows total revenues to be recognized over an entire project or phase  considering both revenues recognized to date plus estimated revenues to be recognized over future periods  less an estimate of uncollectibility  is determined 
total costs of a project or phase  considering both costs already incurred plus estimated costs to complete the phase  if any  is determined 
common costs  including amenities  are included in total estimated costs and allocated to inventory phases that such costs are expected to benefit 
the cost of sales ratio applied to each sale represents total estimated costs as a percentage of total estimated revenues  which is specific to each inventory phase 
generally  each building type is considered a separate phase 
the estimate of total revenue for a particular phase also considers factors such as trends in uncollectibles  changes in sales mix and unit sales prices  repossessions of vacation intervals  effects of upgrade programs  and past and expected sales programs to sell slow moving inventory units 
at least quarterly we evaluate the estimated cost of sales percentage applied to each sale using updated information for total estimated phase revenue and total estimated phase costs 
the effects of changes in estimates are accounted for in the period in which such changes first become known on a retrospective basis  such that the balance sheet at the end of the period of change and the accounting in subsequent periods reflect the revised estimates as if such estimates had been the original estimates 

table of contents as mentioned  certain vacation interval sales transactions are deferred until the minimum down payment has been received 
we account for these transactions utilizing the deposit method 
under this method  the sale is not recognized  a receivable is not recorded  and inventory is not relieved 
any cash received is carried as a deposit until the sale can be recognized 
when these types of sales are cancelled without a refund  deposits forfeited are recognized as income and the interest portion is recognized as interest income 
this income is not significant 
we also sell additional and upgraded vacation intervals to existing owners 
revenues are recognized on an additional vacation interval sale  which represents a new vacation interval sale treated as a separate transaction from the original vacation interval sale  when the buyer makes a down payment of at least  excluding any equity from the original vacation interval purchased 
revenues are recognized on an upgrade vacation interval sale  which is a modification and continuation of the original sale  by including the buyer s equity from the original vacation interval towards the down payment of at least 
revenue recognized on upgrade vacation interval sales represents the difference between the upgrade sales price and traded in sales price  while related cost of sales represents the incremental increase in the cost of the vacation interval purchased 
we recognize interest income as earned 
interest income is accrued on notes receivable  net of an estimated amount that will not be collected  until the individual notes become days delinquent 
once a note becomes days delinquent  the accrual of interest income ceases until collection is deemed probable 
we receive fees for management services provided to silverleaf club and orlando breeze resort club 
these revenues are recognized on an accrual basis in the period the services are provided if collection is deemed probable 
services and other income are recognized on an accrual basis in the period such services are provided 
sales and marketing costs are charged to expense in the period incurred 
commissions  however  are recognized in the same period the related revenues are recognized 
allowance for uncollectible notes estimated uncollectible revenue is recorded at an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance for uncollectible notes at a level management considers adequate to provide for anticipated losses resulting from customers failure to fulfill their obligations under the terms of their notes 
the allowance for uncollectible notes is adjusted based upon a periodic static pool analysis of the notes receivable portfolio  which tracks uncollectible notes for each year s sales over the lives of the notes 
other factors considered in the assessment of uncollectibility include the aging of notes receivable  historical collection experience and credit losses  customer credit scores fico scores  and current economic factors 
credit losses represent three varieties as follows a full cancellation of the note  whereby the customer is relieved of the obligation and we recover the underlying inventory  a deemed cancellation  whereby we record the cancellation of all notes that become days delinquent  net of notes that are no longer days delinquent  and a note receivable reduction that occurs when a customer trades a higher value product for a lower value product 
the allowance for uncollectible notes is reduced by actual cancellations and losses experienced  including losses related to previously sold notes receivable which became delinquent and were reacquired pursuant to the recourse obligations discussed herein 
recourse on sales of customer notes receivable is governed by agreements between the purchasers of said notes and the company 
in accordance with sfas no 
 effective january   the provision for uncollectible notes is characterized as estimated uncollectible revenue and reported as a reduction to vacation interval sales rather than as a separate expense item provision for uncollectible notes 
our estimated uncollectible revenue as a percentage of vacation interval sales was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our provision for uncollectible notes as a percentage of vacation interval sales was for the year ended december  under the relative sales value method  an estimate of the value of inventory recoveries is considered in determining inventory costing and allocation to sales 
prior to  such recoveries were included as a reduction to the provision for uncollectible notes 
considering this change in treatment of inventory recoveries  our net provision for expected credit losses would have been lower for the years ended december  and compared to the year ended december  due to the state of the economy in general  and recent deterioration of the residential real estate market and sub prime mortgage markets  the risk of vacation interval defaults has heightened 
we will continue our current collection programs and seek new programs to reduce note defaults and improve the credit quality of our customers 
however  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value less cost to sell 
cost includes amounts for land  construction materials  amenities and common costs  direct labor and overhead  an estimate for the value of future recoveries  taxes  and capitalized interest incurred in the construction or through the acquisition of resort dwellings held for timeshare sale 
timeshare unit inventory costs are capitalized as inventory and are allocated to cost of vacation interval sales based upon their relative sales values 
we periodically review the carrying value of our inventory on an individual project basis for impairment to ensure that the carrying value does not exceed market value 
inventory costs are charged to cost of sales using the relative sales value method  which is described above 
in estimating the total cost to complete all amenities at each resort  we consider both costs incurred to date and expected costs to be incurred 
at december   the estimated costs not yet incurred but expected to complete promised amenities was million 
we allocate the estimated cost of promised and completed amenities to cost of vacation interval sales based on vacation intervals sold in a given period as a percentage of total vacation intervals expected to sell over the life of a particular resort project  including the estimated resale of the recovered vacation intervals reacquired on estimated future cancelled sales 
vacation intervals may be reacquired as a result of i foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure and ii trade in associated with the purchase of an upgraded or downgraded vacation interval 
vacation intervals reacquired are recorded in inventory at the lower of their original cost or market value 
vacation intervals that have been reacquired are relieved from inventory on a specific identification basis when resold 
inventory acquired several years ago through our program to reacquire vacation intervals owned but not actively used by silverleaf owners has a significantly lower average cost basis than recently constructed inventory  which contributes significantly to historical operating margins 
newer inventory added through our construction and acquisition programs has a higher average cost basis 
liquidity and capital resources as of and for the years ended december    and  we have been in full compliance with our debt covenants in our credit facilities with all of our senior lenders 
the following table summarizes our credit agreements with our senior lenders and our off balance sheet special purpose finance subsidiary  sf iii  as of december  in thousands maximum amount available balance receivable based revolvers receivable based non revolvers inventory loans subtotal on balance sheet off balance sheet receivable based term loan grand total we use these credit agreements to finance the sale of vacation intervals  to finance construction  and for working capital needs 
the loans mature between april and july  and are collateralized or cross collateralized by customer notes receivable  inventory  construction in process  land  improvements  and related equipment at certain of the existing resorts 
our fixed to floating debt ratio at december  was fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
the credit facilities that bear interest at variable rates are tied to the prime rate  libor  or the corporate rate charged by certain banks 
the credit facilities secured by customer notes receivable allow advances of to of eligible customer notes receivable 
in addition  we have million of senior subordinated notes due april  and million of senior subordinated notes due april  with interest payable semi annually on april and october  guaranteed by all of our present and future domestic restricted subsidiaries 
sources of cash 
we generate cash primarily from the cash received on the sale of vacation intervals  the financing and collection of customer notes receivable from vacation interval owners  the sale of notes receivable to our special purpose entities  management fees  sampler sales  marina income  golf course and pro shop income  and hotel income 
we typically receive a to down payment on sales of vacation intervals and finance the remainder with the issuance of a seven to ten year customer promissory note 
we generate cash from customer notes receivable i by borrowing at an advance rate of to of eligible customer notes receivable  ii by selling notes receivable  and iii from the spread between interest received on customer notes receivable and interest paid on related borrowings 
because we use significant amounts of cash in the development and marketing of vacation intervals  but collect cash on customer notes receivable over a seven to ten year period  borrowing against receivables has historically been a necessary part of normal operations 

table of contents during the year ended december   we had net cash provided by operating activities of million  which was primarily the result of sales of notes receivable  partially offset by the increase in our maximum exposure to loss regarding our involvement with sf iii 
during the year ended december   cash used in operating activities was million compared to million during the same period of this million difference in cash used in operating activities during versus primarily resulted from the timing of payments on accounts payable  accrued expenses  income taxes  and prepaid and other assets  partially offset by an increase in inventories due to higher cash outflows for construction projects in the current year 
although it appears we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs through january  we continue to identify additional financing arrangements 
to finance our growth  development  and any future expansion plans  we may at some time be required to consider the issuance of other debt  equity  or collateralized mortgage backed securities 
any debt we incur or issue may be secured or unsecured  have fixed or variable rate interest  and may be subject to such terms as we deem prudent 
uses of cash 
investing activities typically reflect a net use of cash due to capital additions and property acquisitions 
however during  net cash provided by investing activities of million primarily relates to the sale of our water distribution and waste water treatment utilities assets at eight of our resorts  and the sale of undeveloped land located in luzerne county  pennsylvania 
during  investing activities used million of cash compared to million during the million net cash used during resulted primarily from the purchase of the following assets pinnacle lodge our room hotel located near the winter park recreational area in colorado  two offsite sales offices  and a corporate aircraft 
we also began construction on the water park at the villages in these purchases were partially offset by net proceeds of  received from the sale of two parcels of land in mississippi 
the million net cash used during consisted of asset purchases totaling million  partially offset by net proceeds of  received from the sale of a land parcel in texas 
during  we purchased unimproved real property in massachusetts and missouri 
the massachusetts land is a acre tract which adjoins acres that we own in berkshire county  massachusetts  and the missouri land consists of acres and is adjacent to our holiday hills resort in taney county  missouri 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million  which primarily consists of million of payments on borrowings against pledged notes receivable and the repurchase of previously sold notes  partially offset by million of proceeds received from borrowings against pledged notes receivable 
we paid fair value for the outstanding balance of notes receivable under sf i  two non revolving loans with one of our senior lenders  three term notes with another senior lender  and the outstanding balance under both the receivable and inventory loans with a third senior lender 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was million compared to million for the net cash of million provided by financing activities during was primarily the result of million of proceeds received from borrowings against pledged notes receivable  partially offset by million of payments on borrowings against pledged notes receivable and million of increases in restricted cash reserved for payments of debt  all of which were primarily due to our transactions with sf iv and sf v 
the net cash of million provided by financing activities during was primarily the result of million of proceeds received from borrowings against pledged notes receivable and our inventory loans  offset by million of payments on borrowings against pledged notes receivable and other debt 
at december   our senior credit facilities provided for loans of up to million  of which million of principal related to advances under the credit facilities was outstanding 
as of december   the weighted average cost of funds for all borrowings was 
customer defaults have a significant impact on our cash available from financing customer notes receivable in that notes more than days past due are not eligible as collateral 
as a result  we must repay borrowings against such delinquent notes 
as of december   million of notes were more than days past due 
certain debt agreements include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends based on minimum levels of net income and cash flow 
our ability to pay dividends might also be restricted by the texas business corporation act 
off balance sheet arrangements 
in  we consummated a securitization transaction with our wholly owned off balance sheet qualified special purpose finance subsidiary  sf iii  which was formed for the purpose of issuing million of its series a notes in a private placement through ubs securities llc 
in connection with this transaction  we sold sf iii million in timeshare receivables that were previously pledged as collateral under revolving credit facilities with our senior lenders and sf i  our former qualified special purpose entity which was dissolved in the series a notes are secured by timeshare receivables we sold to sf iii pursuant to a transfer agreement between us and sf iii 
the proceeds from the sale of the timeshare receivables to sf iii of million were primarily used to fully pay off the credit facility of sf i and to pay down amounts we owed under credit facilities with our senior lenders 
the timeshare receivables we sold to sf iii are without recourse to us  except for breaches of certain representations and warranties at the time of sale 
in accordance with the agreement  we are responsible for servicing the timeshare receivables purchased by sf iii and receive fees for our services equal to of eligible timeshare receivables held by the facility 
such fees were million  million  and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 

table of contents at december   sf iii held notes receivable totaling million  with related borrowings of million 
except for the repurchase of notes that fail to meet initial eligibility requirements  we are not obligated to repurchase defaulted or any other contracts sold to sf iii 
as servicer of notes receivable sold to sf iii  we are obligated to foreclose upon vacation intervals securing defaulted note receivables 
we may  but are not obligated to  purchase foreclosed vacation intervals for an amount equal to the net fair market value of such vacation intervals  which may not be less than fifteen percent of the original acquisition price that the customer paid for the vacation interval 
for the year ended december   we paid million to repurchase vacation intervals securing defaulted contracts to facilitate the re marketing of those vacation intervals 
the carrying value of our investment in sf iii was million at december   which represents our maximum exposure to loss regarding our obligation with sf iii 
our special purpose entities provide us with additional credit availability under our facilities with our current senior lenders 
as we require credit facilities to provide liquidity necessary to fund our costs and expenses  it is vitally important to our liquidity plan to have financing available to us in order to finance future sales  since we finance the majority of our timeshare sales over seven to ten years 
income taxes 
for regular federal income tax purposes  we report substantially all of the vacation interval sales we finance under the installment method 
under this method  income on sales of vacation intervals is not recognized until cash is received  either in the form of a down payment or as installment payments on customer notes receivable 
the deferral of income tax liability conserves cash resources on a current basis 
interest is imposed  however  on the amount of tax attributable to the installment payments for the period beginning on the date of sale and ending on the date the payment is received 
if we are not subject to tax in a particular year  no interest is imposed since the interest is based on the amount of tax paid in that year 
the consolidated financial statements do not contain an accrual for any interest expense that would be paid on the deferred taxes related to the installment method as the interest expense is not reasonably estimable 
in addition  we are subject to current alternative minimum tax as a result of the deferred income that results from the installment sales treatment 
payment of amt creates a deferred tax asset in the form of a minimum tax credit  which  unless otherwise limited  reduces the future regular tax liability attributable to vacation interval sales 
due to amt losses in certain years prior to  which offset all amt income for years prior to  no minimum tax credit exists for years prior to nevertheless  we had significant amt in and  and anticipate that we will pay significant amt in future periods 
federal net operating losses of million existing at december  expire between and realization of the deferred tax assets arising from nols is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards 
due to a restructuring in  an ownership change within the meaning of section g of the internal revenue code the code occurred 
as a result  our nol is subject to an annual limitation for the current and future taxable years 
this annual limitation may be increased for any recognized built in gain to the extent allowed in section h of the code 
there is an annual limitation of  which was the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change  multiplied by the applicable long term tax exempt rate 
we believe that million of our net operating loss carryforwards as of december  were subject to the section limitations 
discontinued operations 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 the water and utility property assets and liabilities were designated as held for sale effective december  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 the results of operations of these properties are included in income from discontinued operations for all periods presented 
on march   we sold the water distribution and waste water treatment utilities assets at eight of our timeshare resorts for million  which resulted in a gain of  once all conditions of the sale were met 
certain of the purchasers entered into a services agreement to provide uninterrupted water supply and waste water treatment services to our eight timeshare resorts to which the sold utility assets relate 
the purchasers charge our timeshare resorts the tariffed rate for those utility services that are regulated by the states in which the resorts are located 
for any unregulated utility services  the purchasers charge a rate set in accordance with the ratemaking procedures of the texas commission on environmental quality 
the proceeds of our sale of these utility assets were used to reduce senior debt in accordance with our loan agreements with our senior lenders 
our agreement with the purchasers contains provisions relating to the required post closing receipt of customary governmental approvals from utility regulators in missouri and texas 
during  the purchasers received governmental approval from the utility regulators in missouri 
approval from the utility regulators in texas is still pending  with a deadline for obtaining such approvals extended to june if the purchasers do not receive required approvals by such date or if the deadline is not extended  the texas assets will be reconveyed to us  the sale will be rescinded  and we will be obligated to return to the purchasers million of the purchase price attributable to such assets 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating information for the company for the years ended december    and as a percentage of total revenues vacation interval sales estimated uncollectible revenue sampler sales net sales interest income management fee income gain on sale of notes receivable other income total revenues as a percentage of vacation interval sales cost of vacation interval sales sales and marketing provision for uncollectible notes as a percentage of total revenues operating  general and administrative depreciation as a percentage of interest income interest expense and lender fees results of operations for the years ended december  and revenues revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing a million  or increase  compared to revenues of million for the year ended december  as discussed below  the increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in vacation interval sales during the year the following table summarizes our vacation interval sales for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands  except average price sales intervals average price sales intervals average price interval sales to new customers upgrade interval sales to existing customers additional interval sales to existing customers total vacation interval sales increased in versus as a result of increased interval sales to both new and existing customers as a result of an overall growth in customer tours and continued high closing percentages on our sales to both new and existing customers 
the number of interval sales to new customers increased offset by a decrease in average prices of due to promotional pricing we offered during the third and fourth quarters of on select products resulting in a increase in sales to new customers in versus the number of upgrade interval sales to existing customers increased and average prices increased  resulting in a increase in upgrade interval sales to existing customers during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the number of additional interval sales to existing customers increased and average prices decreased also due to promotional pricing on additional interval sales resulting in a net increase in additional interval sales to existing customers during versus estimated uncollectible revenue  which represents estimated future gross cancellations of notes receivable  was million for the year ended december  versus million for the year ended december  our estimated uncollectible revenue as a percentage of vacation interval sales was for the year compared to for our receivables charged off as a percentage of beginning of period gross notes receivable was for compared to for the same period of we believe our notes receivable are adequately reserved  however  there can be no assurance that the percentage of estimated uncollectible revenue will remain at its current level 

table of contents interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase primarily resulted from a higher average notes receivable balance in versus the same period of  and an increase in the average yield on our outstanding notes receivable to at december  from at december  management fee income  which consists of management fees collected from the resorts management clubs  cannot exceed the management clubs net income 
management fee income increased  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   due primarily to increased profitability of the resorts management clubs during versus other income consists of marina income  golf course and pro shop income  hotel income  and other miscellaneous items 
other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to hotel income of million during versus  during  offset by gains on sales of land of  in compared to  in cost of vacation interval sales under the relative sales value method  cost of sales is estimated as a percentage of net sales using a cost of sales percentage which represents the ratio of total estimated cost  including both costs already incurred plus estimated costs to complete the phase  if any  to total estimated vacation interval revenues under the project  including amounts already recognized and estimated future revenues 
common costs  including amenities  are allocated to inventory cost among the phases that those costs are expected to benefit 
the estimate of total revenue for a phase considers factors such as trends in uncollectibles  changes in sales mix and unit sales prices  repossessions of vacation intervals  effects of upgrade programs  and past and expected future sales programs to sell slow moving inventory units 
cost of vacation interval sales decreased to in compared to in during  cost of sales decreased due to increases in our future relative sales value related to an increase in repossession and resale of timeshare intervals  an increase in expected future sales price on some of our higher end products  and an increase in our master plan for new units added across our properties as we continue to execute on our long term growth strategy of adding lodging units  amenities  and other assets to our existing properties 
in addition  we experienced an increase in sales of lower cost basis timeshare intervals during versus these increases were partially offset by costs recognized during related to past construction projects that were terminated as we revamped our master plan during the year 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense as a percentage of vacation interval sales increased to for the year ended december  versus for the comparable prior year period 
the million increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily attributable to our increased volume of vacation interval sales as well as increased costs related to new and existing promotional programs used to generate tours 
these promotional programs were a primary factor in providing us with a growth in tours to potential new purchasers and a increase in vacation interval sales during the year of versus in accordance with sfas no 
 sampler sales and related costs are accounted for as incidental operations  whereby incremental costs in excess of related incremental revenues are charged to expense as incurred 
since our sampler sales primarily function as a marketing program  allowing us additional opportunities to sell vacation intervals to prospective customers  the incremental costs of our sampler sales typically exceed incremental sampler revenues

results of operations for the years ended december  and revenues revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing a million  or increase  compared to revenues of million for the year ended december  as discussed below  the increase is primarily attributable to a million increase in vacation interval sales  net of gains on sales of notes receivable and other income in in accordance with sfas no 
 total revenue for the year ended december  is decreased by estimated uncollectible revenue of million  which represents estimated future gross cancellations of notes receivable 
in addition  under sfas no 
 sampler sales are accounted for as incidental operations  which require that any such incidental revenues be recorded as a reduction of incremental costs or expenses

the following table summarizes our vacation interval sales for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands  except average price average average sales intervals price sales intervals price interval sales to new customers upgrade interval sales to existing customers additional interval sales to existing customers total vacation interval sales increased in versus  due to increased interval sales to both new and existing customers as a result of increased demand from our existing customers for upgraded intervals  higher closing percentages  and lower rescission rates

our receivables charged off as a percentage of beginning of period gross notes receivable was for compared to for the same period of we believe our notes receivable are adequately reserved  however  there can be no assurance that the percentage of estimated uncollectible revenue will remain at its current level 
we reported sampler sales revenues for the year totaling million compared to for during the year ended december   all sampler sales of million were recorded as a reduction to sales and marketing expense  since incremental costs of sampler sales exceeded incremental sampler sales  in accordance with sfas no 
interest income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the increase primarily resulted from i a higher average notes receivable balance in versus the same period of  ii a million increase in interest accretion related to the investment in our special purpose entity for the year ended december  versus the year ended december   and iii an increase in the average yield on our outstanding notes receivable to at december  from at december  management fee income  which consists of management fees collected from the resorts management clubs  cannot exceed the management clubs net income 
management fee income remained constant at million for both years ended december  and there were no sales of notes receivable during the year of we reported gains on sales of notes receivable of million during  resulting from the sale of million and million of notes receivable to sf i and sf iii  respectively  and recognizing pre tax gains of  and million  respectively 
in connection with the sale to sf i  we received cash consideration of million  which was used to pay down borrowings under our senior revolving loan facilities

other income consists of marina income  golf course and pro shop income  land sales  and other miscellaneous items 
other income was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily due to a million gain on the sale of undeveloped land located in pennsylvania during  which is partially offset by a  gain on the sale of two parcels of land in mississippi during  and hotel income of  in cost of vacation interval sales under the relative sales value method  cost of sales is estimated as a percentage of net sales using a cost of sales percentage which represents the ratio of total estimated cost  including both costs already incurred plus estimated costs to complete the phase  if any  to total estimated vacation interval revenues under the project  including amounts already recognized and estimated future revenues 
common costs  including amenities  are allocated to inventory cost among the phases that those costs are expected to benefit 
the estimate of total revenue for a phase considers factors such as trends in uncollectibles  changes in sales mix and unit sales prices  repossessions of vacation intervals  effects of upgrade programs  and past and expected future sales programs to sell slow moving inventory units 
cost of vacation interval sales decreased to in compared to in this decrease is primarily due to the implementation of sfas no 
effective january   which amends the relative sales value method of recording vacation interval cost of sales as noted above 
for comparability  had cost of sales not been reduced by the estimated future recoveries of inventory  as described above  cost of sales for would have been of vacation interval sales versus in higher average sales prices during compared to contributed to the reduction in cost of vacation interval sales 

table of contents sales and marketing sales and marketing expense as a percentage of vacation interval sales decreased to for the year ended december  versus for the same period of the million increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily attributable to our increased volume of vacation interval sales as well as increased costs related to new and existing promotional programs used to generate tours 
these promotional programs were a primary factor in providing us with a increase in vacation interval sales during the year of versus in accordance with sfas no 
 sampler sales and related costs are accounted for as incidental operations  whereby incremental costs in excess of related incremental revenues are charged to expense as incurred 
since our sampler sales primarily function as a marketing program  allowing us additional opportunities to sell vacation intervals to prospective customers  the incremental costs of our sampler sales typically exceed incremental sampler revenues 
accordingly  million of sampler revenues were recorded as a reduction to sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  prior to sfas no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general interest on our notes receivable portfolio  senior subordinated debt  capital leases  and miscellaneous notes is fixed  whereas interest on our primary loan agreements  which had a total facility amount of million at december   have a fixed to floating debt ratio of fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
the impact of a one point effective interest rate change on the million balance of variable rate financial instruments at december  would be approximately million on our results of operations  after taxes  for the year ended december   or approximately per diluted share 
at december   the carrying value of our notes receivable portfolio approximates fair value because the weighted average interest rate on the portfolio approximates current interest rates received on similar notes 
our fixed rate notes receivable are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in fair value if market rates increase  which may negatively impact our ability to sell our fixed rate notes in the marketplace 
a hypothetical one point interest rate increase in the marketplace at december  would result in a fair value decrease of approximately million on our notes receivable portfolio 
credit risk we are exposed to on balance sheet credit risk related to our notes receivable 
we are exposed to off balance sheet credit risk related to notes sold 

table of contents we offer financing to the buyers of vacation intervals at our resorts 
these buyers generally make a down payment of to of the purchase price and deliver a promissory note to us for the balance 
the promissory notes generally bear interest at a fixed rate  are payable over a seven to ten year period  and are secured by a first mortgage on the vacation interval 
we bear the risk of defaults on these promissory notes 
although we prescreen prospects via credit scoring techniques in the early stages of the marketing and sales process  we generally do not perform a detailed credit history review of our customers 
due to the state of the economy in general  and recent deterioration of the residential real estate market and sub prime mortgage markets  the risk of vacation interval defaults has heightened 
because we use various mass marketing techniques  a certain percentage of our sales are to customers who may be considered to have marginal credit quality 
during and  approximately and  respectively  of our sales were made to customers with fico scores below in addition  we have experienced an increase in defaults in our loan portfolio as compared to historical rates 
due to deteriorating conditions in the sub prime mortgage industry there can be no assurance that defaults have stabilized or that they will not worsen 
these and other recent adverse changes in the credit markets and related uncertain economic conditions may eliminate or reduce the availability or increase the cost of significant sources of funding for us in the future 
specifically  if default rates for our borrowers were to rise  it may require an increase in our estimated uncollectible revenue 
we will continue our current collection programs and seek new programs to reduce note defaults and improve the credit quality of our customers 
however  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
if a buyer of a vacation interval defaults  we generally must foreclose on the vacation interval and attempt to resell it  the associated marketing  selling  and administrative costs from the original sale are not recovered  and such costs must be incurred again to resell the vacation interval 
although in many cases we may have recourse against a vacation interval buyer for the unpaid price  certain states have laws that limit our ability to recover personal judgments against customers who have defaulted on their loans 
accordingly  we have generally not pursued this remedy 
interest rate risk we have historically derived net interest income from our financing activities because the interest rates we charge our customers who finance the purchase of their vacation intervals exceed the interest rates we pay to our senior lenders 
because of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates and our customer notes receivable bear interest at fixed rates  increases in interest rates will erode the spread in interest rates that we have historically experienced and could cause our interest expense on borrowings to exceed our interest income on our portfolio of customer loans 
although interest rates have recently been trending downward  any increase in interest rates  particularly if sustained  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
to partially offset potential increases in interest rates  we have executed two interest rate swaps related to our conduit loan with sf ii  with fixed rates of and  for a total notional amount of million at december  such interest rate swaps expire between september and march our variable funding note with sf iv also acts as an interest rate hedge since it contains a provision for an interest rate cap 
the balance outstanding under this line of credit at december  was million 
such variable funding note will mature in september in addition  the series a notes related to our off balance sheet special purpose finance subsidiary  sf iii  with a balance of million at december   bear interest at a blended fixed rate of availability of funding sources we fund substantially all of our notes receivable  timeshare inventories  and land inventories which we originate or purchase with borrowings through our financing facilities  sales of notes receivable  internally generated funds  and proceeds from public debt and equity offerings 
borrowings are in turn repaid with the proceeds we receive from collections on such notes receivable 
to the extent that we are not successful in maintaining or replacing existing financings  we would have to curtail our operations or sell assets  thereby having a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition 
geographic concentration our notes receivable and vacation interval inventories are primarily originated in texas  missouri  illinois  massachusetts  georgia  and florida 
risks inherent in such concentrations are regional and general economic stability  which affects property values and the financial stability of the borrowers  and the continued popularity of our resort destinations  which affects the marketability of our products and the collection of notes receivable
