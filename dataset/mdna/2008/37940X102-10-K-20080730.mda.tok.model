index to financial statements total revenues from our merchant services and money transfer segments  by geography and sales channel  are as follows amounts in thousands year ended may  domestic direct canada asia pacific central and eastern europe domestic indirect and other merchant services domestic europe money transfer total revenues merchant services segment our offerings in the merchant services segment provide merchants  independent sales organizations  or isos  and financial institutions with credit and debit card transaction processing  as well as check related services 
we use two basic business models to market our merchant services offerings 
one model  referred to as direct merchant services  features a salaried and commissioned sales force  isos and independent sales representatives  all of whom sell our end to end services directly to merchants 
our other model  referred to as indirect merchant services  provides the same basic products and services as direct merchant services  primarily to financial institutions and a limited number of isos on an unbundled basis  that in turn resell our products and services to merchants 
we also offer sales  installation and servicing of atm and point of sale  or pos  terminals and selected card issuing services  which are components of indirect merchant services  through global payments europe  sro  formerly known as muzo  which is our subsidiary based in the czech republic 
our direct merchant services are marketed in the united states  canada  and throughout the asia pacific region  while our indirect merchant services are marketed in the united states  canada  and europe 
direct merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced as a percentage of transaction value  whereas indirect merchant services revenue is generated on services primarily priced on a specified amount per transaction 
in both merchant services models  we also charge other processing fees unrelated to the number of transactions or the transaction value 
direct merchant services we market our services through a variety of sales channels that includes a dedicated sales force  isos  an internal telesales group  trade associations  alliance and agent bank relationships  retail outlets and financial institutions 
in addition to receiving referrals from approximately  bank branch locations in canada  we have affiliations in the united states with hundreds of organizations that provide sales leads  including financial institutions  alliance bank branch locations  trade associations  and value added resellers  or vars 
additionally  we market directly to customers through print advertising and direct mail efforts 
we also participate in major industry tradeshows and publicity events and actively execute various public relations campaigns 
in the asia pacific region  we market through a dedicated sales force and receive referrals from hsbc bank branch locations 
we pursue this strategy because we believe that it utilizes one of the lowest cost delivery systems available to acquire customers successfully

index to financial statements credit and debit card transaction processing credit and debit card transaction processing includes the processing of visa  mastercard and discover credit cards  cards issued by other card associations like american express  diners club  and jcb  and on line and off line debit cards 
credit and debit card processing involves a consumer or cardholder acquiring goods or services from a merchant and using a credit or debit card as the form of payment 
the term merchant generally refers to any organization that accepts credit or debit cards for the payment of goods and services  such as retail stores  including physical locations and internet sites  mail order or telephone order outlets  restaurants  universities and government agencies 
we are the processing intermediary between the merchant and the card associations  debit networks and financial institutions 
although card transactions may appear to be simple  a transaction requires a complex process involving various participants in a series of electronic connections 
in addition to electronic transaction payment processors such as global payments  also known as merchant acquirers  participants in this process include card issuers  cardholders  merchants  card associations and card association members 
card issuers are financial institutions that issue credit and debit cards to approved applicants and are identifiable by their trade name typically imprinted on the issued cards 
an approved applicant for a credit or debit card from a card issuer is referred to as a cardholder  and may be any entity for which an issuer wishes to extend a line of credit  such as a consumer  corporation or government agency 
the cardholder may use the card at any merchant location that meets the qualification standards of the relevant card association  such as mastercard  visa  discover  other cards such as american express and diners club  or debit networks such as nyce  pulse and star in the united states  interac in canada and the various debit networks in the asia pacific region 
the card associations and debit networks consist of members  generally financial institutions  who establish uniform regulations that govern much of the industry 
during a typical card transaction  the merchant and the card issuer do not interface directly with each other  but instead rely on merchant acquirers 
a merchant acquirer can be an independent processor that acts with a member sponsor  such as global payments  or the merchant acquirer can be a bank itself 
we perform a series of services including authorization  electronic draft capture  file transfers to facilitate the funds settlement and certain exception based  back office support services such as chargeback and retrieval resolution 
the following is a more detailed description of credit and debit card transactions a card transaction begins when a cardholder presents a card for payment at a merchant location and the merchant swipes the card s magnetic strip through a pos terminal card reader  which may be provided by global payments 
alternatively  card and transaction information may be captured and transmitted to our network through a pos device by one of a number of products that we offer directly or through a var 
for a credit card transaction  authorization services generally refer to the process in which the card issuer indicates whether a particular credit card is authentic and whether the impending transaction value will cause the cardholder to exceed defined credit limits 
the terminal electronically records sales draft information  such as the credit card identification number  transaction date and value of the goods or services purchased 
debit card payments differ slightly from traditional credit card transactions in that the cardholder is required to have sufficient funds available in a deposit account at the time of the transaction  or the debit card transaction will not be authorized 
pin based or on line debit transactions are sent through a debit network  while signature based  off line debit  or check card transactions are sent through card associations and require a signature at the time of purchase 
also  pin based or on line debit transactions typically deduct the purchase amount from the cardholder s deposit account within a day of the purchase  depending on the time of the purchase 
signature based  off line debit or check card transactions typically debit the cardholder s deposit account two to three days after the purchase  although the funds are held with a memo posted to the cardholder s bank account 
a credit card transaction posts to a cardholder s account  reducing the available credit limit in a similar manner 
after the card and transaction information is captured by the pos device  the terminal automatically either dials a pre programmed phone number or otherwise connects to our network  such as through the internet or a 
table of contents 
index to financial statements leased line  in order to receive authorization of the transaction 
we route the request to the applicable card association or debit network 
the card association or debit network forwards the authorization request to the card issuer  who determines a response based on the status of the cardholder s account 
the response is returned to the merchant s terminal via the same communication network 
this entire authorization and response process occurs within seconds from the time the merchant swipes the cardholder s card through the pos terminal card reader 
electronic draft capture is the process of transferring sales draft data into an electronic format so that it may be sent through networks for clearing and settlement 
the card associations use a system known as interchange  in the case of credit and off line debit cards  and financial institutions use the debit networks  in the case of on line debit cards  to transfer the information and funds between the card issuers and us to complete the link between merchants and card issuers 
in order to provide credit card transaction processing services  we must be designated as a certified processor by mastercard and visa  in addition to a merchant service provider by mastercard and an independent sales organization by visa 
these designations are dependent upon member clearing banks of either organization sponsoring us and our adherence to the standards of the visa and mastercard associations 
a financial institution that is a member of the visa and or mastercard card associations the member must sponsor an electronic transaction payment processor such as global payments 
we have four primary financial institution sponsors in the united states  canada  and the asia pacific region with whom we have sponsorship or depository and processing agreements 
these agreements allow us to route transactions under the member banks control and identification numbers to clear credit card transactions through visa and mastercard 
the member financial institutions of visa and mastercard  some of which are our competitors  set the standards with which we must comply 
we also provide credit card transaction processing for discover financial services or discover card discover and are designated as an acquirer by discover 
this designation provides us with a direct relationship between us and discover  and therefore a member sponsorship is not required 
our agreement with discover allows us to route and clear transactions directly through discover s network 
otherwise  we process discover transactions similarly to how we process mastercard and visa transactions 
discover publishes acquirer operating regulations  with which we must comply 
we use our members to assist in funding merchants for discover transactions 
funds settlement refers to the process of transferring funds for sales and credits between cardholders and merchants 
depending on the type of transaction  either the credit card interchange system or the debit network is used to transfer the information and funds between the member and card issuer to complete the link between merchants and card issuers 
for transactions processed on our systems  we use our network telecommunication infrastructure to deliver funding files to the member  which creates a file to fund the merchants using country specific payment networks such as the federal reserve s automated clearing house system in the united states or the automated clearing settlement system or the large value transfer system in canada 
in our united states portfolio and in most of our canadian portfolio  merchant funding primarily occurs after the member receives the funds from the card issuer through the card associations 
for certain of our canadian and asia pacific merchant accounts  the member funds the merchants before the member receives the net settlement funds from the card associations  creating a net settlement asset at the member 
in certain asia pacific countries  the member provides the payment processing operations and related support services on our behalf under a transition services agreement 
the member will continue to provide these services until we fully integrate the asia pacific operations into our own operations  which we expect will be completed in phases through after our integration  the member will continue to provide funds settlement services similar to the functions performed by our members in the united states and canada 
timing differences  interchange expenses  merchant reserves and exception items cause differences between the amount the member receives from the card associations and the amount funded to the merchants 
the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements standards of the card associations restrict us from performing funds settlement or accessing merchant settlement funds  and  instead  require that these funds be in the possession of the member until the merchant is funded 
however  in practice and in accordance with the terms of our sponsorship agreements with our members  we follow a net settlement process whereby  if the incoming amount from the card associations precedes the member s funding obligation to the merchant  we temporarily hold the surplus on behalf of the member  in a joint deposit account or in an account at the member bank  and record a corresponding liability 
conversely  if the member s funding obligation to the merchant precedes the incoming amount from the card associations  the amount of the member s net receivable position is either subsequently advanced to the member by us or the member satisfies this obligation with its own funds 
if the member uses its own funds  the member assesses a funding cost  which is included in interest and other expense on the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
each participant in the transaction process receives compensation for its services 
as an illustration  on a credit card transaction  the card association may fund the member after retaining a hypothetical referred to as an interchange fee or interchange expense 
the card associations have published hundreds of different interchange expense rate arrangements 
the card issuer seeks reimbursement of from the cardholder in the cardholder s monthly credit card statement 
the member would  in turn  pay the merchant 
the net settlement after this transaction would require us to advance to the member 
after the end of the month  we would bill the merchant a percentage of the transaction  or discount  to cover the full amount of the interchange fee and our net revenue from the transaction 
if our net revenue from the merchant in the above example was of the credit card transaction value  we would bill the merchant at the end of the month for the transaction  reimburse ourselves for approximately in interchange fees advanced to the member and retain as our net revenue for the transaction 
our gross profit on the transaction reflects the net revenue less operating expenses  including the network and systems cost to process the transaction and commissions paid to our sales force or isos 
if it is determined that the merchant in the above transaction is to be placed on reserve or delay  then collateral is held to minimize contingent liabilities to us associated with charges properly reversed by cardholders  otherwise known as chargebacks 
this contingent liability arises from our performance guarantee to the member sponsor 
the merchant funds are held as a cash deposit to minimize this risk of loss associated with the transactions processed 
on behalf of the member  we hold all or a portion of the deposit for the convenience of the member 
in this situation  the member would net fund us  the same amount the member received from the card association 
this amount is comprised of the that would have been funded by the member to the merchant  less the same for the interchange expense 
if a transaction we had processed previously through the member is charged back by the cardholder through the card issuer  the member is notified of the shortfall in the anticipated wire transfer 
if the amount of the chargeback is  the member would receive  net from the card association and be required to fund the merchant the same 
therefore  we would be required to advance to the member 
this amount is comprised of for the chargeback  plus the same for the interchange expense 
in addition to the card processing services described above  we also process retrieval requests on behalf of merchants for issuing banks and provide chargeback resolution services  both of which relate to cardholders disputing an amount that has been charged to their card 
we review the dispute and handle the related exchange of information and funds between the merchant and the card issuer if a charge is to be reversed 
as a result of our financial institution sponsorship and the terms of our standard merchants agreement  our direct merchant services customers are liable for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder 
in the event  however  that we are not able to collect such amount from the merchants  due to merchant fraud  insolvency  bankruptcy or any other reason  we may be liable for any such reversed charges 
we utilize a number of systems and procedures to manage merchant risk 
our risk management services include credit underwriting  credit scoring  fraud control  account processing and collections 
in addition  we may require cash deposits  guarantees  letters of credit and other types of collateral by certain merchants to minimize any such contingent liability 
notwithstanding our risk management activities  we have historically experienced losses due to merchant defaults

index to financial statements check services our check products offer merchant customers risk management alternatives  in the case of our verification and recovery offerings  or risk elimination  in the case of our guarantee offerings  by leveraging our internal and external databases of checkwriters to help decide whether the merchant should accept a check as the form of payment from a particular checkwriter 
our check services products are part of our domestic direct service offering 
check guarantee services include comprehensive check verification and guarantee services designed for a merchant s specific needs and risk adversity 
this service offering guarantees payment of all checks that are electronically verified  primarily using pos check readers and our extensive databases  which allows merchants to expand their revenue base by applying less stringent requirements when accepting checks from consumers 
if a verified check is dishonored  our check guarantee service generally provides the merchant with reimbursement of the check s face value  and then we pursue collection of the check through our internal collection services 
while we have the right to collect the full amount of the check from the checkwriter  we have historically recovered less than of the guaranteed checks 
to protect against this risk  we use verification databases that contain information on historical delinquent check writing activity 
we derive revenue for these services primarily by charging the merchant a percentage of the face value of each guaranteed check 
check verification and recovery services are similar to those provided in the check guarantee service  except that these services do not guarantee payment of the verified checks 
check verification services provide a low cost loss reduction solution for merchants wishing to measure a customer s check worthiness quickly at the point of sale without incurring the additional expense of check guarantee services 
we provide check recovery services for these customers upon their request 
we derive revenues for these services primarily from the service fees collected from delinquent check writers  fees charged to merchants based on a transaction rate per verified check  and fees charged to merchants for specialized services  such as electronic re deposits of dishonored checks 
in the specialized vertical market of gaming  our vip lightspeed proprietary software and vip preferred advantage product provide the gaming industry with the tools necessary to establish revolving check cashing limits for the casinos customers 
vip preferred offers both traditional and electronic check cashing options which eliminates the need for paper checks as part of the vip lightspeed suite of products 
further  our atm cash advantage product allows the casinos customers to cash electronic checks at certain atms using a vip preferred card to initiate the transaction 
lastly  our playercash advantage product  formerly referred to as cash and win  allows the casinos customers to complete credit and debit card cash advances by utilizing specialized kiosks to initiate the advances and then completing the transaction at the casino cage 
our gaming products allow fast access to cash with high limits so that gaming establishments can increase the flow of money to their gaming floors and reduce risk 
we derive revenue from our gaming products primarily based on a percentage of the transaction value 
indirect merchant services through our indirect merchant services business model  we market unbundled products and services primarily to financial institutions and a limited number of isos that in turn resell our products and services to merchants 
the primary service offering in this business model is credit and debit card transaction processing 
these products and services are identical with those offered under our direct merchant services business model 
we primarily perform authorization  electronic draft capture and file transfer services for our indirect merchant services customers 
in addition  we may perform merchant accounting and other back office services 
the primary differences between indirect merchant services credit and debit card transaction processing and direct merchant services relate to funds settlement and financial institution sponsorship 
our indirect merchant services customers perform their own funds settlement and either have separate financial institution sponsorship or their own identification numbers  referred to as bank identification number  or bin  for visa

since we are not party to the financial institution sponsorship  we are not potentially liable for any charges properly reversed by the cardholder 
our merchant accounting services provide information primarily for our indirect merchant services customers to monitor portfolio performance  control expenses  disseminate information and track profitability through the production and distribution of detailed statements summarizing electronic transaction payment processing activity 
our risk management services allow financial institutions to monitor credit and transaction risk  thereby enhancing the profitability of their merchant portfolios 
our risk management services include credit underwriting  credit scoring  fraud control  account processing and collections 
in europe  we provide these indirect merchant services through our global payments europe subsidiary 
consistent with the european payments processing environment  global payments europe s offerings also include terminal management services for atm and pos terminals  as well as card issuing services 
our card issuing services in europe include card database management and card personalization 
we also provide credit scoring services to financial institutions in the czech republic  slovakia and russia 
our domestic indirect and other service offering also provides financial and operational data to financial institutions  corporations and government agencies and allows these organizations to exchange this information with financial institutions and other service providers 
we also provide edi tax filing and internet tax payment services that allow financial institutions and government agencies to offer corporate taxpayers a secure and convenient method of paying taxes electronically 
these services are primarily priced based on a rate per transaction processed 
money transfer segment our money transfer segment provides consumer money transfer services 
a majority of the revenue derived from our money transfer offering consists of our electronic money transfer services marketed under our dolex brand to first and second generation latin americans living in the united states 
this segment regularly transfers money to family and friends living in latin america 
following the europhil acquisition in december  we expanded our money transfer origination locations to europe and our settlement locations to morocco  the philippines  romania  poland and other new destinations 
as of may   we operated originating retail branch locations in the united states and in europe  and have settlement arrangements with more than  bank  exchange house  and retail locations worldwide 
the money transfer service offering is primarily driven by transaction levels and unit pricing 
our business strategy is to competitively price our services  provide a timely and quality service  diversify our services through new product offerings and increase our physical presence through branch acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  new branch openings  and expand our settlement network 
we believe this strategy will further expand our customer base and increase our market share 
in a typical money transfer transaction  a customer visits one of our originating branch locations and pays a fee based on the nature and amount of the transaction performed on the customer s behalf 
where applicable  the customer is quoted a retail exchange rate when the money transfer transaction is requested 
the customer will receive a receipt that includes the amount the beneficiary will receive  the retail exchange rate  money transfer fee  settlement location and total amount that was remitted to us 
we earn additional revenue based on the difference between the retail exchange rate that is quoted and the wholesale exchange rate when the currency is purchased  which is in much larger denominations than the individual customer s transaction 
on each business day  we estimate the amount of currency needed by our settlement locations  bid the wholesale exchange rates based on the amount needed and purchase currency at the best available rates

index to financial statements employees as of may   we had  employees 
many of our employees are highly skilled in technical areas specific to electronic transaction payment processing and money transfer 
we believe that our current and future operations depend substantially on retaining our key technical employees 
competition merchant services segment our primary competitors in the electronic transaction payment processing industry include other merchant acquirers  as well as major national and regional financial institution processors and isos  some of which are our customers 
certain of these companies are privately held  and the majority of those that are publicly held do not release the information necessary to quantify our relative competitive position precisely 
as an independent merchant acquirer  our principal affiliation with financial institutions relates to the sponsorship that enables our access to the card associations and debit networks 
we believe an independent merchant acquirer  such as global payments  will tend to be more of an advocate for the merchant customer  as there is no other relationship with a card issuing business or cardholder customer service  which is typical of a financial institution processor 
also  a financial institution processor s sales channel is primarily based on customer referrals within the institution while an independent processor or iso will tend to be focused on sales from all channels  including internally generated leads 
finally  a financial institution processor may not have the same executive focus on a merchant acquiring business  as the business is generally not core to the total revenues of the financial institution 
we primarily differ from isos in that we have our own processing platform and financial institution sponsorship agreements 
based on industry publications such as the nilson report  dated march  we are a leading mid market and small market merchant acquirer in the united states 
according to that report  one of our competitors  first data corporation and its affiliates  which include chase paymentech solutions  is the largest electronic transaction payment processor in the united states 
our primary competitor in canada is moneris solutions  which we believe has a larger share of the canadian merchant acquiring market based on volume processed 
moneris solutions is a joint venture between the royal bank of canada and the bank of montreal 
we also consider chase paymentech solutions and td merchant services to be major competitors in the canadian market 
in the asia pacific region  our primary competition is from financial institutions that offer merchant acquiring services 
in europe  our primary competition is from financial institutions  other third party processors and from software providers that offer financial institutions the ability to process transactions in house 
we service a variety of industry segments and specialize in direct merchant services  primarily the mid market and small market segments in the united states  large and mid market segments in canada and large and mid market segments in the asia pacific region 
we define mid market as a merchant with an average of  to  in annual card volume 
card volume represents the dollar value of transactions processed by the merchant for credit and debit card transactions 
many of our iso relationships provide merchant referrals in the small market segment  with average annual card volumes below  national accounts or large market merchants that we serve typically range between million to million in annual card volume  although we serve a limited number of merchants with more than million in such volume and a select few merchants with more than billion in such volume 
our primary strategy to distinguish ourselves from our competitors focuses on offering a variety of electronic transaction payment processing solutions to our customers 
these enhanced services involve vertical market functionality and sophisticated reporting features that add value to the information obtained from our electronic transaction payment processing databases 
we believe that our knowledge of these specific markets  
table of contents 
index to financial statements the size and effectiveness of our dedicated sales force  affiliations with trade associations  agent banks  original equipment manufacturers or oems and value added resellers or vars  our ability to offer specific  integrated solutions to our customers  including hardware  software  processing  and network facilities  and our flexibility in packaging these products are positive factors that enhance our competitive position 
money transfer segment our primary competitors in the money transfer industry are western union and moneygram  who are more diversified with a broader international reach than us 
in addition  we face competition from a number of smaller money transfer operators who focus on money transfers from the united states to latin america 
many of our competitors use agency agreements with third parties at the point of sale to collect funds and input transaction data 
we generally use a fixed cost  branch owned model at the point of sale rather than a variable cost  agent based model 
we believe this model enhances our growth strategy  as higher transaction levels may provide significant future leverage 
the most significant competitive factors relating to our money transfer offering include price  reliability  customer service  functionality  the breadth and effectiveness of our distribution channel and value added features 
these competitive factors will continue to change as new distribution channels and alternative payment solutions are developed by our competitors and us 
many money transfer operators  including us  are developing ancillary products and services such as stored value cards  check cashing and bill payments 
increasingly  card based solutions are being introduced at the origination and settlement points  replacing the current cash based solution 
our ability to effectively compete in the marketplace depends on our ability to adapt to these technological and competitive advancements 
we believe our knowledge of the industry  our relative size and our branch owned model give us an advantage over our competitors when adapting to these changes 
industry overview and target markets industry overview payment processing service providers offer high volume electronic transaction payment processing and support services directly to financial institutions  merchants  multinational corporations  government agencies and isos 
generally  the payment processing market in the united states and canada continues to transition from traditional financial institution providers to independent merchant acquirers  such as global payments 
we believe merchants seek more efficient distribution channels  as well as increased technological capabilities required for the rapid and efficient creation  processing  handling  storage  and retrieval of information 
in the european and asia pacific regions  financial institutions remain the dominant provider of payment processing services to merchants  although the outsourcing of back end processing services to third party service providers is becoming more prevalent 
throughout all markets  processing services have become increasingly complex  requiring significant capital commitments to develop  maintain and update the systems necessary to provide these advanced services at a competitive price 
we also provide electronic money transfer services to consumers in the united states and europe who send money to latin america  morocco  the philippines  romania  poland and other destinations 
unlike our major competitors in the latin american corridor that operate an agent based network  we generally utilize a branch owned network strategy at the point of sale 
we believe that this differentiation allows us to be more flexible and competitive when setting our prices and introducing new products and services 
as a result of continued growth in our industry  several large merchant acquirers  including us  have expanded operations both domestically and internationally 
this expansion has come in the form of acquisitions and the creation of alliances and joint ventures 
we believe that the electronic payment transaction processing and money transfer industries will continue to consolidate as banks and independent processors that do not have the necessary infrastructure to participate in a highly competitive environment look to exit the business

index to financial statements in the canadian market  visa  mastercard and interac are planning to migrate to cards containing chip technology over the coming years 
chip technology provides the ability to process payment transactions securely by protecting the cardholder information in an encrypted and confidential manner 
the chip is difficult to copy and has the additional capacity to be personalized by a card issuer  including the ability to be programmed with spending and usage limits  making it possible to authorize some transactions off line 
chip technology can also help enable a variety of additional card features including applications such as loyalty  access control  rewards and public transit passes 
we expect that it will take multiple years for all participants to implement the computer equipment and merchant terminals necessary to accept and process the chip card compliant transactions in the canadian marketplace 
we have developed a long term plan to ensure our merchants will benefit from the migration to chip technology in the canadian market 
in addition  we have begun to deploy chip card capable terminals in the canadian market 
chip card technology is already prevalent in the european and asia pacific markets 
we believe the number of electronic transactions will continue to grow in the future and that an increasing percentage of these transactions will be processed through emerging technologies 
to help our customers reduce their transaction costs and speed up the transaction approval process  we have integrated new technologies into our service offerings such as internet protocol communications and check truncation or conversion at the point of sale 
if new technologies like radio frequency identification or contactless payment cards continue to evolve and are desired by merchants and consumers  we plan to continue developing new products and services that will exploit the benefits that these new technologies can offer our customers 
we also believe that new emerging markets will continue to develop in areas that have been previously dominated by paper based transactions 
industries such as quick service restaurants  government  recurring payments  and business to business should continue to see transaction volumes migrate to more electronic based settlement solutions 
we believe that the continued development of new products and services and the emergence of new vertical markets will be a factor in the growth of our business for the foreseeable future 
target markets we believe that significant global opportunities exist for continued growth in the application of electronic transaction payment processing and money transfer services 
although the united states accounts for the largest payment processing volume in the world  global expansion by financial institutions into new geographies and the increased recognition by governments of the ability of payment cards to facilitate economic growth are rapidly transforming the electronic commerce market into a global payments opportunity 
additionally  increased migration trends led by the rapid globalization of the economy are also leading the way for increased electronic money transfer opportunities 
the growth of retail credit card transactions  as well as the rapid growth in the utilization of debit cards  directly correlates with the historic growth of our business 
according to the nilson report dated may  worldwide annual general purpose card purchase volume increased to trillion in general purpose cards include the major card association brands such as american express  discover  diners club  jcb  mastercard and visa 
in canada  general purpose cards also include interac debit cards 
the nilson report dated may estimates that more than trillion of annual consumer spending was charged in using general purpose cards in the united states  an increase from based on figures reported in the nilson report dated february  billion us of annual canadian consumer spending uses general purpose cards as the form of payment  representing an increase of over the nilson report dated june estimates that trillion of annual consumer spending was charged in using general purpose cards in europe  a increase from we process in ten countries and territories in the asia pacific region 
this market includes almost of the world s population and of the total asia pacific population according to the cia world factbook

index to financial statements according to the world bank s migration and remittances factbook edition  nearly million people  or approximately of the world s population  are international immigrants 
the world bank estimates that over billion was remitted internationally worldwide in with a significant portion of the volume originating in the united states 
according to the inter american development bank  the expected value of electronic money transfer remittances to the latin american market in was estimated to be almost billion  of which billion is estimated to be from the united states 
the growth rate of remittances from the united states to latin america has decreased over the past year  primarily due to a slowing united states economy  a downturn in the united states housing and construction markets  and increased enforcement of immigration policies 
strategy in pursuing our business strategy  we seek to increase our penetration in existing markets  expand into new geographic regions  as represented by our acquisitions in the asia pacific and european regions  and expand into new payment areas  as represented by our acquisitions in the electronic money transfer industry 
we believe that this strategy provides us with the greatest opportunity to expand our existing business  leverage our existing infrastructure  and maintain a consistent base of recurring revenues  thereby maximizing shareholder equity and acquisition returns on investment 
we intend to accomplish this overall strategy as follows existing offerings in pursuing this business strategy  we intend to increase our penetration of existing markets and to further leverage our infrastructure 
our objectives to execute this strategy include the following expand our direct merchant services distribution channels  primarily our existing sales force  isos  oems  vars and other referral relationships  provide the best possible customer service at levels that exceed our competitors by investing in technology  training and product enhancements  grow our direct merchant services market share in the united states  canada  united kingdom  and asia pacific region by concentrating on the small and mid market merchant segments  grow our indirect merchant services market share in europe by concentrating on financial institutions with an existing or an emerging focus on merchant acquiring  card issuing  and credit scoring  grow our money transfer customer base and market share by expanding our branch and settlement locations and offering competitive pricing  provide the latest  secure and enhanced products and services by developing value added applications  enhancing existing products and developing new systems and services to blend technology with our customer needs  and focus on potential domestic and international acquisitions or investments and alliances with companies that have high growth potential and operate in profitable sectors of payments related industries through compatible products and services  and development and distribution capabilities 
international markets we intend to focus on further diversification in international markets with high payments industry growth  such as latin america  europe and the asia pacific region 
we may expand our direct merchant services  indirect merchant services and money transfer offerings into these markets  either organically or through acquisitions 
we are evaluating these markets due to the following attractive characteristics currently low but growing credit and debit card utilization  high level of immigrants who desire to send money using a non bank provider  the absence of a dominant merchant acquirer or processor  and potential to satisfy our acquisition strategy 

table of contents 
index to financial statements infrastructure our focus on the existing infrastructure will center on attracting  developing and retaining talent to execute our strategy and migrate our systems to leading edge technology 
we intend to continue systems integrations  primarily the consolidation of operating platforms 
we continue to make progress on our next generation technology processing platform 
this platform is planned to be a new front end operating environment for our merchant processing in the united states  asia pacific  the united kingdom  and canada  and is intended to replace several legacy platforms that have higher cost structures 
aside from cost advantages  there are many other benefits to this new platform  such as increased speed to market of new products  ease of scalability  enhanced reporting options  hardware environment flexibility  and compliance with emv and pci standards 
in addition  the platform is being designed as a potential integration platform for future acquisitions  which may help us achieve higher acquisition synergies in the future 
maximize corporate returns finally  we believe we will maximize corporate returns by leveraging our core technology and operational capabilities and continue cost reduction initiatives to maximize shareholder equity and acquisition returns on investment 
currently  we have the following multi year initiatives  among others  underway that we expect will facilitate this goal developing a new technology platform that will enable us to consolidate our front end platforms in the united states and canada  migrating the asia pacific and united kingdom back end and front end platforms away from hsbc and onto our own platforms  pursuing price reductions from our vendor relationships  and streamlining of management positions and operating functions 
compliance money transfer licensing and regulations we are subject to various united states federal  state and foreign laws and regulations governing money transmission and the sale of payment instruments  such as official checks and money orders 
in the united states  most states license consumer money transfer service providers and issuers of money orders such as dolex 
the applicable state statutes and regulations typically require dolex to obtain and maintain certain required licenses as a condition to performing these activities 
these statutes and regulations vary  but generally require dolex to do the following a satisfy minimum net worth and other financial covenant requirements  b periodically submit information regarding financial results  changes in corporate documentation or ownership  insurance  and other relevant information  c procure and maintain a surety bond with minimum statutory levels of coverage  d demonstrate the character and fitness of the officers and directors of dolex  and e be subject to periodic financial and operational audits 
the state licenses have varying renewal periods 
certain licenses have a specific term of one or more years and require renewals at the end of such term  while others remain in effect unless revoked 
the money transfer service offering also is subject to regulation by various agencies of the federal government that are charged with implementing and enforcing anti money laundering laws and regulations  including the bank secrecy act  as amended by the usa patriot act of  collectively referred to as the bsa 
the bsa  among other things  requires money transfer companies to develop and implement risk based anti money laundering programs  report large cash transactions and suspicious activity  and maintain transaction records 
in addition  certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the treasury

index to financial statements department s office of foreign assets control  or ofac  prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries  their governments  and in certain circumstances  their nationals  and with individuals and entities that are specially designated nationals of those countries  narcotics traffickers  and terrorists or terrorist organizations 
global payments european money transfer companies  created through europhil  our acquisition in december  are regulated by various governmental agencies in spain  belgium  and the united kingdom in their money transfer activities 
prior to its acquisition by global payments  europhil received approval from these governmental agencies to act as a money transfer service provider 
the requirements of these governmental agencies vary  but generally require europhil to do the following a satisfy minimum share capital requirements  b periodically submit information regarding financial results  changes in corporate documentation or ownership  insurance  and other relevant information  c register and maintain transaction information  d maintain adequate insurance coverage  e ensure the transparency of the conditions of the transactions to its customers  f implement safeguards and restrictions to prevent money laundering  and g subject itself to periodic audits 
in addition  the money transfer service offerings are subject to regulation in the settlement countries in which dolex and europhil offer their services 
these regulations may include limitations on what types of entities may offer money transfer services  limitations on the amount of principal that can be moved into or out of a country  limitations on the number of money transfers that may be received by a customer  limitations on the exchange rates between foreign currencies  and regulations intended to help detect and prevent money laundering 
dolex and europhil have developed compliance programs to monitor regulatory requirements and developments and to implement policies and procedures to help satisfy these requirements in each origination and settlement jurisdiction 
in addition  our use of a united states and european branch network for the origination of electronic money transfers  rather than an agent model typically utilized by our larger competitors  allows greater control over our regulatory compliance

table of contents 
index to financial statements item a risk factors our revenues from the sale of services to merchants that accept visa cards and mastercard cards are dependent upon our continued visa and mastercard certification and financial institution sponsorship 
in order to provide our transaction processing services  we must be designated a certified processor by  and be a merchant service provider of  mastercard and an independent sales organization of visa 
these designations are dependent upon our being sponsored by member clearing banks of both organizations and our continuing adherence to the standards of the visa and mastercard associations 
there are a limited number of member clearing banks worldwide that are willing to sponsor certified processors  such as us  and attaining new sponsorship agreements is highly difficult 
the member financial institutions of visa and mastercard  some of which are our competitors  set the standards with which we must comply 
if we fail to comply with these standards  our designation as a certified processor  a merchant service provider or as an independent sales organization could be suspended or terminated 
the termination of any of these designations  the loss of any of our four primary sponsor banks  or any changes in the visa and mastercard rules that prevent our registration or otherwise limit our ability to provide transaction processing and marketing services for the visa or mastercard organizations would likely result in the loss of merchant customers and lead to a material reduction in our revenues and earnings 
loss of key independent sales organizations could reduce our revenue growth 
our iso sales channel  which purchases and resells our end to end services to its own portfolio of merchant customers  is a strong contributor to our revenue growth 
if an iso switches to another transaction processor  we will no longer receive new merchant referrals from the iso 
in addition  we risk losing existing merchants that were originally enrolled by the iso 
consequently  if a key iso switches to another transaction processor  our revenues and earnings could be negatively affected 
risks associated with operations outside the united states could adversely affect our business  financial position and results of operations 
we are exposed to foreign currency risks resulting from changes in currency exchange rates because of our significant international operations  as well as our significant electronic money transfer operations in the united states and europe 
our international revenues and profits will increase or decrease compared to prior periods as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use forward contracts or other derivative instruments to mitigate the risks associated with our foreign operations 
we have significant operations in subsidiaries in canada  the czech republic  and throughout the asia pacific region whose functional currency is their local currency 
we will have a similar risk in the united kingdom as a result of our acquisition of hsbc merchant services 
we are subject to the risk that currency exchange rates between these regions and the united states will fluctuate  potentially resulting in a loss of some of our revenue and earnings when such amounts are exchanged into united states dollars 
we also have significant money transfer operations in the united states and europe which subject us to foreign currency exchange risks as our customers deposit funds in the local currencies of the originating countries where our branches are located  and we typically deliver funds denominated in the home country currencies to each of our settlement locations 
in addition  in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate  we may become subject to exchange control regulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our foreign currency into united states dollars or limit our ability to freely move currency in or out of particular jurisdictions 

table of contents 
index to financial statements some of our competitors are larger and have greater financial and operational resources than we do  which may give them an advantage in our market with respect to the pricing of our products and services offered to our customers  our ability to develop new technologies  and our ability to complete acquisitions 
we operate in the electronic payments and money transfer markets 
our primary competitors in these markets include other independent processors and electronic money transmitters  as well as certain major national and regional banks  financial institutions and independent sales organizations 
companies who are larger than we are have greater financial and operational resources than we have 
this may allow them to offer better pricing terms to customers  which could result in a loss of our potential or current customers or could force us to lower our prices as well 
either of these actions could have a significant effect on our revenues and earnings 
in addition  our competitors may have the ability to devote more financial and operational resources than we can to the development of new technologies  including internet payment processing services that provide improved operating functionality and features to their product and service offerings 
if successful  their development efforts could render our product and services offerings less desirable to customers  again resulting in the loss of customers or a reduction in the price we could demand for our offerings 
lastly  our competitors may be willing or able to pay more than us for acquisitions  which may cause us to lose certain acquisitions that we would otherwise desire to complete 
our money transfer service offerings are dependent on financial institutions to provide such offerings 
our money transfer service offerings involve transferring funds internationally and are dependent upon foreign and domestic financial institutions  including our competitors  to execute funds transfers and foreign currency transactions 
changes to existing regulations of financial institution operations  such as those designed to combat terrorism or money laundering  could require us to change our operational procedures in such a way that might increase our costs of doing business or could require us to terminate certain product offerings 
in addition  as a result of existing regulations and or changes to such regulations  financial institutions could decide to cease providing the services on which we depend entirely  requiring us to terminate certain product offerings in specifically impacted markets 
in fact  several significant financial institutions have ceased providing such services as a result of existing regulations  which  in a particular instance  required us to rapidly switch to different financial institution providers of these services 
in the future  the inability to purchase these services from significant regional or national financial institutions would likely result in a material reduction to our money transfer revenue and earnings 
we are subject to the business cycles and credit risk of our merchant customers and  to a lesser extent  consumer checkwriters 
a recessionary economic environment could affect our merchants through a higher rate of bankruptcy filings  resulting in lower revenues and earnings for us 
our merchants are liable for any charges properly reversed by the card issuer on behalf of the cardholder 
in the event  however  that we are not able to collect such amounts from the merchants  due to merchant fraud  insolvency  bankruptcy or any other reason  we may be liable for any such charges 
any risks associated with an unexpected recessionary economy that we could not mitigate may result in lower revenues and earnings for us 
although we believe our historical loss rates are within or below industry averages  we process billions of dollars in annual volume that are subject to these risks 
a recessionary economic environment could also cause checkwriters to dishonor a greater number of checks issued to our merchant customers 
if we are unable to collect the face value of these checks  we may incur higher losses and lower earnings 
in order to remain competitive and to continue to increase our revenues and earnings  we must continually update our products and services  a process which could result in increased research and development costs in excess of historical levels and the loss of revenues  earnings and customers if the new products and services do not perform as intended or are not accepted in the marketplace 
the electronic payments and money transfer markets in which we compete include a wide range of products and services including electronic transaction payment processing  money transfer  transaction reporting and other 
table of contents 
index to financial statements customer support services 
these markets are characterized by technological change  new product introductions  evolving industry standards and changing customer needs 
in order to remain competitive  we are continually involved in a number of research and development projects including the development of a new front end platform for electronic payments processing 
these projects carry the risks associated with any research and development effort  including cost overruns  delays in delivery and performance problems 
in the electronic payments and money transfer markets these risks are even more acute 
our markets are constantly experiencing rapid technological change 
any delay in the delivery of new products or services could render them less desirable to our customers  or possibly even obsolete 
in addition  the products and services we deliver to the electronic payments and money transfer markets are designed to process very complex transactions and deliver reports and other information on those transactions  all at very high volumes and processing speeds 
any performance issue that arises with a new product or service could result in significant processing or reporting errors 
as a result of these factors  our research and development efforts could result in increased costs that could reduce our earnings  in addition to a loss of revenue and earnings if promised new products are not timely delivered to our customers or do not perform as anticipated 
security breaches or system failures could harm our reputation and adversely affect future earnings 
we handle personal consumer data  such as names  credit and debit account numbers  checking account numbers and payment history records 
we process that data and deliver our products and services by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated both by us and by third party service providers 
although plans and procedures are in place to protect this sensitive data and to prevent failure of  and to provide backup for  our systems  we cannot be certain that our measures will be successful 
a security breach or other misuse of such data  or failures of key operating systems and their back ups  could harm our reputation and deter customers from using our products and services  increase our operating expenses in order to correct the breaches or failures  expose us to unbudgeted or uninsured liability  increase our risk of regulatory scrutiny including the imposition of penalties and fines under state  federal and foreign laws  and adversely affect our continued visa and mastercard certification and financial institution sponsorship 
reduced levels of consumer spending can adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
significant portions of our revenue and earnings are derived from fees from processing consumer credit card and debit card transactions and electronic money transfer transactions 
any recession or economic downturn in the united states or any other country where we do business could negatively impact consumer spending and adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
changes in state  federal and foreign laws and regulations affecting the electronic money transfer industry might make it more difficult for our customers to initiate money transfers  which would adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
if state  federal or foreign authorities adopt new regulations or raise enforcement levels on existing regulations that make it more difficult for our customers to initiate  or their beneficiaries to receive  electronic money transfers  then our revenues and earnings may be negatively affected 
this particular topic has been widely debated in the united states at both the state and federal levels  with a currently unclear outcome 
any regulation or enforcement practices that are more restrictive than historical levels that relate to latin american immigrants  including those who are not legal residents of the united states  could adversely impact our electronic money transfer revenue and earnings 
changes in immigration patterns can adversely affect our revenues and earnings from electronic money transfers 
our electronic money transfer business primarily focuses on customers who immigrate to the united states from latin american countries in order to find higher paying jobs and then send a portion of their earnings to family members in latin america 
in addition  our electronic money transfer business also focuses on customers 
table of contents 
index to financial statements who immigrate to belgium  the united kingdom  and spain from latin american countries  morocco  the philippines  romania  poland and other countries 
any changes in these immigration patterns for any reason  including government policies or enforcement  may negatively affect the number of immigrants in belgium  the united kingdom  the united states  spain and any new countries in which we expand our money transfer service offering in the future  which may reduce our customer base and our corresponding revenues and earnings 
in order for us to continue to grow and increase our profitability  we must continue to expand our share of the existing electronic payments and money transfer markets and also expand into new markets 
our future growth and profitability depend upon our continued expansion within the markets in which we currently operate  the further expansion of these markets  the emergence of other markets for electronic transaction payment processing  including internet payment systems  and our ability to penetrate these markets 
as part of our strategy to achieve this expansion  we are continually looking for acquisition opportunities  investments and alliance relationships with other businesses that will allow us to increase our market penetration  technological capabilities  product offerings and distribution capabilities 
we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition  investment and alliance candidates in the future  and if we do  they may not provide us with the benefits we anticipated 
once completed  investments and alliances may not realize the value that we expect 
our expansion into new markets is also dependent upon our ability to apply our existing technology or to develop new applications to meet the particular service needs of each new market 
we may not have adequate financial or technological resources to develop products and distribution channels that will satisfy the demands of these new markets 
if we fail to expand into new and existing electronic payments and money transfer markets  we may not be able to continue to grow our revenues and earnings 
any changes made to laws  regulations  card association rules or other industry standards affecting our business in any of the geographic regions in which we operate may require significant development efforts or have an unfavorable impact to our financial results 
there may be changes in the laws  regulations  card association rules or other industry standards that affect the way we do business 
in the united states  legislation has recently been introduced at the federal level to regulate the fees charged to merchants for card processing services 
we are unable to predict whether any of this potential legislation will be enacted or whether any card association rule or other industry standard will change 
furthermore  we cannot predict the impact of any of these changes on our operations and financial condition 
these changes may require significant efforts to change our systems and products and may require changes to how we price our services to customers 
failure to comply with these laws  regulations  and standards may impact our ability to do business and jeopardize our card association certification and financial institution sponsorship 
increases in credit card association fees may result in the loss of customers or a reduction in our earnings 
from time to time  the credit card associations  including visa and mastercard  increase the fees interchange and assessment fees that they charge processors such as us 
we could attempt to pass these increases along to our merchant customers  but this strategy might result in the loss of those customers to our competitors who do not pass along the increases 
if competitive practices prevent our passing along such increased fees to our merchant customers in the future  we may have to absorb all or a portion of such increases thereby increasing our operating costs and reducing our earnings 
utility and system interruptions or processing errors could adversely affect our operations 
in order to process transactions promptly  our computer equipment and network servers must be functional on a hour basis  which requires access to telecommunications facilities and the availability of electricity 
furthermore  with respect to certain processing services  we are dependent on the systems and services of third 
table of contents 
index to financial statements party vendors 
telecommunications services and the electricity supply are susceptible to disruption 
computer system interruptions and other processing errors  whether involving our own systems or the systems operated by our third party vendors  may result from such disruption or from human error or other unrelated causes 
any extensive or long term disruptions in our processing services could cause us to incur substantial additional expense and the loss of customers  which could have an adverse affect on our operations and financial condition 
the integration of our acquired operations  or other future acquisitions  if any  could result in increased operating costs if the anticipated synergies of operating both businesses as one are not achieved  a loss of strategic opportunities if management is distracted by the integration process  and a loss of customers if our service levels drop during or following the integration process 
the integration of these businesses with ours presents several challenges  including the fact that they may be based in the regions where we do not currently have operations 
if the integration process does not proceed smoothly  the following factors could reduce our revenues and earnings  increase our operating costs  and or result in a loss of projected synergies we could lose employees to our competitors in the region  which could significantly affect our ability to operate the business and complete the integration  if we are unable to successfully integrate the benefits plans  duties and responsibilities  and other factors of interest to the management and employees of the acquired business  we could lose customers to our competitors  which would reduce our revenues and earnings  if the integration process causes any delays with the delivery of our services  or the quality of those services  and the acquisition and the related integration could divert the attention of our management from other strategic matters including possible acquisitions and alliances and planning for new product development or expansion into new electronic payments markets 
continued consolidation in the banking and retail industries could adversely affect our growth 
as banks continue to consolidate  our ability to offer our services through indirect channels successfully will depend in part on whether the institutions that survive are willing to outsource their credit and debit card processing to third party vendors and whether those institutions have pre existing relationships with any of our competitors 
larger banks and larger merchants with greater transaction volumes may demand lower fees which could result in lower revenues and earnings for us 
loss of strategic industries could reduce revenues and earnings 
although our merchant acquiring portfolio is well diversified and neither one economic sector nor any customer concentration represents a significant portion of our business  a decrease in strategic industries could cause us to lose significant revenues and earnings 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract additional qualified personnel as we grow  our business could be adversely affected 
we are dependent upon the ability and experience of a number of our key personnel who have substantial experience with our operations  the rapidly changing transaction processing and money transfer industries  and the selected markets in which we offer our services 
it is possible that the loss of the services of one or a combination of our key personnel would have an adverse effect on our operations 
our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract  manage  and retain additional qualified management and technical personnel as we grow 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to attract or retain such personnel 

table of contents 
index to financial statements our financial results may be adversely affected if we have to impair our intangible assets or goodwill 
as a result of our acquisitions  a significant portion of our total assets consist of intangible assets including goodwill 
goodwill and intangible assets  net of amortization  together accounted for approximately and of the total assets on our balance sheet as of may  and may   respectively 
we may not realize the full fair value of our intangible assets and goodwill 
we expect to engage in additional acquisitions  which may result in our recognition of additional intangible assets and goodwill 
under current accounting standards  we are able to amortize certain intangible assets over the useful life of the asset  while goodwill is not amortized 
we evaluate on a regular basis whether all or a portion of our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired 
under current accounting rules  any determination that impairment has occurred would require us to write off the impaired portion of goodwill and such intangible assets  resulting in a charge to our earnings 
such a write off could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may become subject to additional united states  state or foreign taxes that cannot be passed through to our merchant services or money transfer customers  in which case our earnings could be adversely affected 
payment processing companies like us may be subject to taxation by various jurisdictions on our net income or certain portions of our fees charged to customers for our services 
application of these taxes is an emerging issue in our industry and the taxing authorities have not yet all adopted uniform regulations on this topic 
if we are required to pay such taxes and are not able to pass the tax expense through to our merchant customers  our costs will increase  reducing our earnings 
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
section of the sarbanes oxley act requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual report 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
further  this assessment may be complicated by any acquisitions we may complete 
during the first fiscal quarter of  we completed the purchase of a fifty six percent ownership interest in the asia pacific merchant acquiring business of the hongkong and shanghai banking corporation limited  or hsbc asia 
this business provides card payment processing services to merchants in the asia pacific region 
the business includes hsbc asia s payment processing operations in the following ten countries and territories brunei  china  hong kong  india  macau  malaysia  maldives  singapore  sri lanka and taiwan 
in conjunction with this acquisition  we entered into a transition services agreement with hsbc asia that may be terminated at any time 
under this agreement  we expect hsbc asia will continue to perform payment processing operations and related support services until we integrate these functions into our own operations 
until we can integrate the acquisition s financial reporting function into our own  we will rely on hsbc asia to provide financial data  such as revenue billed to merchants  to assist us with compiling our accounting records 
accordingly  our internal controls over financial reporting could be materially affected  or are reasonably likely to be materially affected  by hsbc asia s internal controls and procedures 
in order to mitigate this risk  we have implemented internal controls over financial reporting which monitor the accuracy of the financial data being provided by hsbc asia 
we will have a similar situation in the united kingdom as a result of our fifty one percent acquisition of hsbc merchant services 
while we continue to dedicate resources and management time to ensuring that we have effective controls over financial reporting  failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the market s perception of our business and our stock price

index to financial statements anti takeover provisions of our articles of incorporation and by laws  our rights agreement and provisions of georgia law could delay or prevent a change of control that individual shareholders favor 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and by laws  our rights agreement and provisions of applicable georgia law may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or other change of control that shareholders may consider favorable 
the provisions of our articles and by laws  among other things divide our board of directors into three classes  with members of each class to be elected in staggered three year terms  limit the right of shareholders to remove directors  regulate how shareholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings of shareholders  and authorize our board of directors to issue preferred shares in one or more series  without shareholder approval 
we may not be able to or we may decide not to pay dividends or repurchase shares at a level anticipated by shareholders on our common stock  which could reduce shareholder returns 
the payment of dividends and repurchase of shares are at the discretion of our board of directors and will be subject to our financial results  our working capital requirements  the availability of acquisitions and other business opportunities  the availability of surplus funds  interest rate levels  debt covenants  our stock price levels and restrictions under financing agreements 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to or will choose to pay any dividends or repurchase any shares in the foreseeable future 
unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies could adversely affect our tax expense 
we have established contingent liabilities for tax exposures relating to deductions  transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item 
these liabilities reflect what we believe to be reasonable assumptions as to the likely final resolution of each issue if raised by a taxing authority 
while we believe that the liabilities are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  there can be no assurance that  in all instances  an issue raised by a tax authority will be finally resolved at a financial cost less than any related liability 
an unfavorable resolution  therefore  could negatively impact our results of operations 
we conduct a portion of our business in various latin american  eastern european and asia pacific countries  where the risk of continued political  economic and regulatory change that could impact our operating results is greater than in the united states 
we expect to continue to expand our operations into various countries in latin america  eastern europe  and the asia pacific 
some of these countries have undergone significant political  economic and social change in recent years  and the risk of new  unforeseen changes in these countries remains greater than in the united states 
in particular  changes in laws or regulations or in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations  whether caused by a change in government or otherwise  could materially adversely affect our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
transmittal of data by electronic means and telecommunications is subject to specific regulation in many countries
