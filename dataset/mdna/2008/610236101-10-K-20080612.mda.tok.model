critical accounting policies the company believes that the accounting policies listed below are those that are most critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and that required management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note to the consolidated financial statements which includes other significant accounting policies 
inventory the company evaluates whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market based on historical experience with the carrying value and life of inventory 
the assumptions used in this evaluation are based on current market conditions and the company believes inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market in the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  historically the company has been able to return excess items to vendors for credit or sell such inventory to wholesalers 
future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory could require a revision in the estimates 
carrying values of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill represents the amount paid in consideration for an acquisition in excess of the net assets acquired 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company does not amortize goodwill for acquisitions made after june  the company conducts tests for impairment of goodwill annually  typically during the third quarter of the fiscal year  or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
these impairment tests include management estimates of future cash flows that are dependent upon subjective assumptions regarding future operating results including growth rates  discount rates  capital requirements and other factors that impact the estimated fair value 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that an asset s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the company evaluates the carrying values of its long lived assets to be held and used in the business by reviewing undiscounted cash flows by operating unit 
such evaluations are performed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in such instances  the carrying values are adjusted for the differences between the fair values and the carrying values 
additionally  in the case of fixed assets related to locations that will be closed or sold  the company shortens the depreciable life of the related assets to coincide with the planned sale or closing date 
self insurance reserves the company is largely self insured with respect to workers compensation  general liability and employee medical claims 
in order to reduce its risk and better manage its overall loss exposure  the company purchases stop loss insurance that covers individual claims in excess of the deductible amounts 
the company maintains an accrual for the estimated cost to settle open claims as well as an estimate of the cost of claims that have been incurred but not reported 
these estimates take into consideration the historical average claim volume  the average cost for settled claims  current trends in claim costs  changes in the company s business and workforce  and general economic 
table of contents factors 
these accruals are reviewed on a quarterly basis  or more frequently if factors dictate a more frequent review is warranted 
warranty the company provides an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based upon the historical relationship of warranty costs to sales  except for tire road hazard warranties which are accounted for in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts 
warranty expense related to all product warranties at and for the fiscal years ended march  and was not material to the company s financial position or results of operations

r  r  r  r  r  and r  using the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  effective march  the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model that uses the following assumptions 
expected volatilities are based on historical changes in the market price of the company s common stock 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the vesting period of the award  as well as historical exercise behavior  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is calculated using the implied yield on zero coupon us treasury bonds with a remaining maturity equal to the expected term of the awards 
the company uses historical data to estimate forfeitures 
the dividend yield is based on historical experience and expected future changes 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
the company s provision for income taxes and effective tax rates are calculated by legal entity and jurisdiction and are based on a number of factors  including the company s income  tax planning strategies  differences between tax laws and accounting rules  statutory tax rates and credits  uncertain tax positions  and valuation allowances 
the company uses significant judgment and estimates in evaluating its tax positions 
tax law and accounting rules often differ as to the timing and treatment of certain items of income and expense 
as a result  the tax rate reflected in the company s tax return the current or cash tax rate is different from the tax rate reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
some of the differences are permanent  while other differences are temporary as they reverse over time 
the company records deferred tax assets and liabilities for any temporary differences between the tax reflected in the company consolidated financial statements and tax bases 
the company establishes valuation allowances when it believes it is more likely than not that its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at any one time  the company s tax returns for several tax years are subject to examination by us federal and state taxing jurisdictions 
the company establishes tax liabilities in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin

an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized in the financial statements unless it is more likely than not to be sustained 
the company adjusts these tax liabilities  as well as the related interest and penalties  based on the latest facts and circumstances  including recently published rulings  court cases  and outcomes of tax audits 
to the extent the company s actual tax liability differs from its established tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits  the company s effective tax rate may be materially impacted

results of operations fiscal as compared to fiscal sales for fiscal increased million  or to million as compared to million in fiscal the increase was due to an increase of approximately million from new stores which are defined as stores added since march   including million from the acquired procare stores and million from the former craven  valley forge and broad elm stores acquired in fiscal comparable store sales increased 
adjusting for days  comparable store sales increased 
partially offsetting this was a decrease in sales from closed stores amounting to million 
fiscal was a week year  and therefore  there were selling days as compared to selling days in fiscal year during the year  stores were added and nine were closed 
at march   the company had stores in operation 
management believes that the improvement in comparable store sales resulted from several factors  including an increase in brake sales  tire sales  maintenance services and alignments 
price increases in several product categories also contributed to the sales improvement 
comparable store traffic declined but average ticket increased 
management believes that soft economic conditions resulted in consumers deferring repairs to their vehicles 
however  most repairs can only be deferred for a period of time 
when customers did come in to have their vehicles repaired  it is management s belief that they spent more on average because the problem with their vehicle had worsened due to additional wear 
the company introduced scheduled maintenance services in all of its stores late in fiscal these services are required by vehicle manufacturers to comply with warranty schedules  and are offered by monro in a more convenient and cost competitive fashion than auto dealers typically provide 
management believes that these services  which are offered both in bundled packages and individually  will continue to contribute positively to comparable store sales in future years  and have helped to mitigate the decline in exhaust which negatively impacted recent fiscal years 
the exhaust decline resulted primarily from manufacturers use of non corrosive stainless steel exhaust systems on most new cars beginning in the mid s and completed in the mid s 
as occurred in fiscal and  the company completed the bulk sale of approximately million of slower moving inventory to icon international  a barter company  in exchange for barter credits 
the margin recognized in these transactions is typically less than the company s normal profit margin 
the barter transactions that occurred in fiscal decreased gross profit by 
of sales as compared to fiscal the bulk sales of inventory to icon are important transactions for the company 
the sales help to improve inventory turns 
as more vendor agreements fall under the newer vendor rebate rules  which require that vendor rebates be recognized in concert with the related inventory turns  inventory turns have a more direct impact on cost of goods sold and gross profit than in the past 
the company has demonstrated its ability to consistently use the credits 
since it began doing barter transactions in the late s  the company has used over million of credits with vendors and the barter company 
barter credits are recorded at their net realizable value 
additionally  the company continued to reward store employees with pay programs focused on high customer service scores 
management believes that  in spite of the sluggish economic environment  it is continuing to build the trust of its customers  through quality  integrity and fair pricing  and is gaining an advantage over some of its competitors 
the new procare stores acquired on april  were purchased out of bankruptcy 
these stores suffered significant declines in recent years and did not perform at a profitable level in fiscal or as a result  these stores lost approximately 
per share in fiscal  as compared to 
per share in fiscal however  sales have improved and continue to improve since the acquisition  and efforts continue which focus on increasing sales volumes  reducing costs and improving margins 
comparable store sales for the procare stores in fiscal 
table of contents increased  or adjusted for selling days 
gross profit improved by basis points  operating income improved by 
million to million and the pretax loss declined by 
million to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
for the company  gross profit for fiscal was million or of sales as compared with million or of sales for fiscal the decrease in gross profit for the year ended march   as a percentage of sales  is due to several factors 
a primary reason for the decrease was decreased leverage in distribution and occupancy costs related to the loss of six selling days between the two fiscal years 
without the extra selling week  gross profit for fiscal would have been or flat with fiscal barter sales transactions also decreased gross profit by 
of a percent of sales for the full fiscal year as compared to 
for fiscal additionally  the valley forge  craven and broad elm stores acquired in fiscal increased consolidated cost of sales and decreased gross profit by 
of sales 
in addition  chainwide  there was a slight shift in mix to the lower margin tire category away from higher margin categories 
there were cost increases  as well  in oil and tires 
for tires  the company was able to effectively offset these increases with increases in selling prices  thereby preserving margins 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in labor costs as a percent of sales  primarily due to the significant improvement in productivity of the technicians at the procare stores  achieved through improved sales and right sizing of crews 
additionally  selling price increases for product categories other than oil and tires helped partially offset the aforementioned items which increased material costs 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for fiscal increased by million to million from fiscal  and were of sales as compared to in the prior year 
the increase in sg a consisted of several items 
first  there was decreased leverage in sg a due to one less selling week in fiscal as compared to fiscal additionally  the expense related to stock options increased by million in fiscal over fiscal of this increase  
million  or 
of a percent  related to the award of vested options to the company s chief executive officer in connection with the renewal of his employment contract 
the company recorded a 
million charge related to the settlement of a wage and labor class action lawsuit involving headquarters employees filed against the company in fiscal year there was also a shift in cooperative advertising credits from sg a to cost of sales in connection with the accounting for new vendor agreements under eitf which caused sg a expenses to increase approximately 
of a percentage point as compared to the prior year 
in addition  the company experienced increases in health and workers compensation insurance expense as compared to the prior year  accounting for 
of the increase as a percent of sales 
the largest drivers of the dollar increases in sg a expenses in fiscal were as follows direct store expenses such as manager pay  advertising  supplies  etc 
increased million over the prior year related to the broad elm  valley forge  craven and a full year of the procare stores included in fiscal as compared to fiscal cooperative advertising credits decreased a shift to gross profit by million  stock option expense increased million  benefits expense increased million and the lawsuit settlement added 
million  as previously discussed above 
intangible amortization for fiscal decreased 
million to 
million from fiscal  and was 
of sales as compared to 
of sales in the prior year 
gain on disposal of assets for fiscal decreased million to million from fiscal  and was 
as a percent of sales as compared to a 
as a percent of sales in the prior year 
this decrease is strictly a function of lower gains on property disposals in fiscal as compared to fiscal effectively  the company sells one or more properties annually  but there will be differences in the timing from one year to the next 
operating income in fiscal of million decreased compared to operating income in fiscal  and decreased as a percentage of sales from to 
net interest expense for fiscal increased by approximately million as compared to the same period in the prior year  and increased from to as a percentage of sales 
the weighted average debt outstanding for the year ended march  increased by approximately million from fiscal  primarily related to the funding of the valley forge  craven and broad elm acquisitions and the funding of the company s stock repurchase program 
the weighted average interest rate was essentially flat between the two years 

table of contents other income  net for fiscal increased million as compared to fiscal  primarily related to the write off of the company s investment in strauss of million in fiscal also contributing to the increase was the company s recognition of 
million of income in the current year in connection with the company s settlement of all outstanding legal claims with strauss and 
million of income from auction direct under the company s consulting agreement 
the company s effective tax rate was and  respectively  of pre tax income in fiscal and in fiscal  income tax expense was reduced by 
million related to the resolution of federal and state tax accounting matters 
offsetting this  was a 
million charge resulting from a reduction in the company s state income tax rate used to calculate deferred taxes 
the company s previously recorded deferred tax assets were reduced  with a corresponding increase in income tax expense 
in fiscal  the company s tax rate was impacted by the recognition of a 
million income tax benefit primarily related to the favorable resolution of state income tax issues and a reduction in income tax reserves in connection with the finalization of the full year tax provision of 
million 
these items had the effect of lowering the company s tax rate by and for fiscal and  respectively 
net income for fiscal decreased by 
million  or  from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal  and earnings per diluted share increased by from 
to post stock split due to the factors discussed 
fiscal as compared to fiscal sales for fiscal increased million  or to million as compared to million in fiscal the increase was due to an increase of approximately million from new stores which are defined as stores added since march   including million from the acquired procare stores  as well as a comparable store sales increase of 
fiscal was a week year  and  therefore  there were selling days in fiscal year as compared to selling days in fiscal year adjusting for days  comparable store sales increased 
during the year  stores were added and were closed 
at march   the company had stores in operation 
as occurred in fiscal  the company completed the bulk sale of approximately million of slower moving inventory to icon international  a barter company 
the bulk sales of inventory to icon are important transactions for the company 
the sales help to improve inventory turns  which becomes a higher priority as interest rates continue to rise  and in light of the accounting rules of emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor  which require that vendor rebates be recognized as inventory turns 
as new vendor agreements fall under these rules  inventory turns have a more direct impact on cost of goods sold and gross profit than in the past 
the company has demonstrated its ability to consistently use the credits 
since it began doing barter transactions in the late s  the company has used over million of credits with vendors and the barter company 
barter credits are recorded at their net realizable value 
management believes that the improvement in sales resulted from several factors  including an increase in tire sales  scheduled maintenance services and alignments 
price increases in several product categories also contributed to the sales improvement 
comparable store traffic improved as did average ticket 
management believes that soft economic conditions resulted in consumers deferring repairs to their vehicles  especially in the first half of the company s fiscal year  which typically accounts for slightly more than of its sales and of its earnings 
in the first half of fiscal  the company s comparable store sales declined 
however  most repairs can only be deferred for a period of time 
when customers did come in to have their vehicles repaired  it is management s belief that they spent more on average because the problem with their vehicle had worsened due to additional wear 
the new procare stores acquired on april  were purchased out of bankruptcy 
these stores suffered significant sales declines in recent years and did not perform at a profitable level in fiscal the procare stores 
table of contents lost approximately 
in diluted earnings per share in fiscal however  sales improved over the course of fiscal and efforts were made to reduce costs and improve margins 
gross profit for fiscal was million or of sales  as compared with million or of sales for fiscal the procare stores increased consolidated cost of sales and reduced gross profit by 
as a percentage of sales during fiscal the decrease in consolidated gross profit occurred primarily in the areas of labor and material costs 
even in times of declining sales  technicians receive a minimum base wage when they are not fully productive 
this subsidization of wages in the procare stores raised labor costs as a percentage of consolidated sales 
higher than normal outside purchases of parts by the procare stores increased total material costs 
however  the company saw declines in outside purchases over the course of the year as it added to  and rebalanced  the inventory at these locations 
the company expects to see more improvement in this expense line as it continues to refine the types and level of inventory which is carried at these stores  and as these stores continue to improve their level of transfers of product from neighboring stores 
additionally  due to negative comparable store sales at these locations  fixed occupancy costs created pressure on gross margin 
without the procare stores  gross profit was of sales for fiscal  as compared to in the prior year 
the improvement in gross profit as a percentage of sales is due to a couple of factors 
one reason is the shift of vendor rebates or cooperative advertising credits from selling  general and administrative expenses sg a to cost of sales 
additionally  the company earned more vendor rebates in fiscal than it did in fiscal these rebates offset the negative impact of the shift in mix to the lower margin tire and maintenance services categories 
decreases in technician labor and occupancy costs also contributed to the improvement in gross margin as compared to the prior year 
technician labor costs decreased due to better operational control and improved productivity 
additionally  the increase in tire sales  which carry lower labor costs as compared to other service categories  helped to decrease labor costs as a percent of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal distribution and occupancy costs as a percentage of sales in fiscal also decreased as compared to fiscal  as the company  with improved sales  was able to better leverage these largely fixed costs 
additionally  expenditures for building maintenance in fiscal were slightly less than the prior year 
sg a for fiscal increased by million to million  and increased as a percentage of sales to compared to in the procare stores accounted for a 
increase in store direct cost included in sg a as compared to the prior year 
manager pay and benefits are included in store direct costs  and being largely fixed  put adverse pressure on margins against negative comparable store sales in these locations 
in addition to the percentage increase attributable to the procare stores  a shift in cooperative advertising credits from sg a to cost of sales in connection with the accounting for new vendor agreements under eitf caused sg a to increase approximately one percentage point as compared to the prior year 
partially offsetting these increases  however  was a decrease in management bonus expense due to the company not attaining minimum profit goals 
the company experienced an unplanned charge of million in workers compensation and garage liability insurance expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and these expenses also increased million over the same quarter of last year 
however  benefits expense in total  which includes workers compensation expense  was flat for the year as a percent of sales when compared to the prior year because of an offsetting decline in health insurance expense which had occurred over the course of fiscal general insurance expense for the full year  which includes garage liability insurance  increased only slightly over the prior year 
the company adopted sfas r in fiscal and recognized approximately 
million of expense related to stock options issued in fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company accelerated the vesting of all outstanding stock options and recognized a charge of approximately 
million just prior to adoption 
most of this expense is included in sg a in both years 
intangible amortization for fiscal increased 
million to million from fiscal  and was 
of sales for both years 
gain on disposal of assets for fiscal increased million to million from fiscal  and was 
of sales as compared to a 
of sales in the prior year 
this increase was due to the relocation of a mr 
tire store in the current year 
the owners of the property paid the company 
million to relinquish the lease 
the company did not have a similar transaction in the prior year 
in addition  in the current year there was a reduction in the closed 
table of contents store reserves  resulting in income of 
million 
the remainder of the increase was due to the sale of certain properties in the current fiscal year that had larger gains than the property sold in the prior year 
operating income in fiscal of million  or of sales  increased by million from the fiscal level of million  due to the factors discussed above 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased as a percent of sales from 
in fiscal to in fiscal the weighted average debt outstanding for the year ended march  increased by approximately million from fiscal  primarily related to million of capital leases assumed in connection with the procare acquisition  involving locations  partially offset by net payments on the company s revolving credit facility 
additionally  there was an increase in the weighted average interest rate for the year ended march  of approximately basis points from the year ended march   resulting in an increase in expense between the two years 
the increase was also largely due to the interest rates associated with the capital leases which are generally much higher than the company s incremental borrowing rate under its revolving credit facility 
other expense  net  for fiscal increased million as compared to fiscal this increase was mainly due to the loss on investment in r s parts and service  inc of million 
as discussed elsewhere in this form k  during fiscal  the company recorded an impairment charge with respect to its original equity investment as well as due diligence costs related to r s  upon learning that r s had filed petitions for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code  and deciding that it would not exercise its option to purchase the remaining of r s
