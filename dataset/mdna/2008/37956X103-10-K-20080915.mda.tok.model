item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains  in addition to historical information  forward looking statements  within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  such as  among others  our dependence on a limited number of contracts for a high percentage of our revenues and a significant reduction in revenues from the government marketplace 
these risks and others are more fully described in the risk factors section and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
overview our business is global and subject to technological and business trends in the telecommunications marketplace 
we derive much of our revenue from government and government related entities government marketplace and developing countries 
our business is therefore affected by geopolitical developments involving areas of the world in which our customers are located  particularly in developing countries and areas of the world involved in armed conflicts 
the products and services we offer include pre engineered systems  systems design and integration services  managed network services and life cycle support services 
to provide these products and services  we engineer all the necessary satellite and terrestrial facilities as well as provide the integration services required to implement those facilities 
we also operate and maintain managed networks and provide life cycle support services on an ongoing basis 
our customers generally have network service requirements that include point to point or point to multipoint connections via a hybrid network of satellite and terrestrial facilities 
in addition to the government marketplace  these customers are communications service providers  commercial enterprises and media and content broadcasters 
since our products and services are often sold into areas of the world which do not have fiber optic land based networks  a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from  and are expected to continue to be derived from  developing countries 
these countries carry with them more enhanced risks of doing business than in developed areas of the world  including the possibility of armed conflicts or the risk that more advanced land based telecommunications will be implemented over time 
in the year ended june   of our revenues were derived from a us government agency 
although the identity of customers and contracts may vary from period to period  we have been  and expect to continue to be  dependent on revenues from a small number of customers or contracts in each period in order to meet our financial goals 
from time to time these customers are located in developing countries or otherwise subject to unusual risks 
revenues related to contracts for infrastructure solutions and services have been fixed price contracts in a majority of cases 
profitability of such contracts is subject to inherent uncertainties as to the cost of performance 
in addition to possible errors or omissions in making initial estimates  cost overruns may be incurred as a result of unforeseen obstacles  including both physical conditions and unexpected problems encountered in engineering design and testing 
since our business is frequently concentrated in a limited number of large contracts  a significant cost overrun on any contract could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contract costs generally include purchased material  direct labor  overhead and other direct costs 
anticipated contract losses are recognized  as they become known 
costs from infrastructure solutions consist primarily of the costs of purchased materials including shipping and handling costs  direct labor and related overhead expenses  project related travel and living costs and subcontractor salaries 
costs from services consist primarily of satellite space segment charges  voice termination costs  network operations expenses and internet connectivity fees 
satellite space segment charges consist of the costs associated with obtaining satellite bandwidth the measure of capacity used in the transmission of services to and from the satellites leased from operators 
network operations expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the operation of the network operations center on a twenty four hour a day  seven day a week basis  including personnel and related costs and depreciation 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  travel and living costs for sales and marketing personnel 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related overhead expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist of expenses associated with our management  finance  contract and administrative functions 
critical accounting policies certain of our accounting policies require judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these judgments under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies that require management to apply significant judgment include revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition  for our production type contracts that are sold separately as standard satellite ground segment systems when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  delivery has occurred and the contractual performance specifications have been met 
our standard satellite ground segment systems produced in connection with these contracts are typically short term less than twelve months in term and manufactured using a standard modular production process 
such systems require less engineering  drafting and design efforts than our long term complex production type projects 
revenue is recognized on our standard satellite ground segment systems upon shipment and acceptance of factory performance testing which is when title transfers to the customer 
the amount of revenues recorded on each standard production type contract is reduced by the customer s contractual holdback amount  which typically requires to of the contract value to be retained by the customer until installation and final acceptance is complete 
the customer generally becomes obligated to pay to of the contract value upon shipment and acceptance of factory performance testing 
installation is not deemed to be essential to the functionality of the system since installation does not require significant changes to the features or capabilities of the equipment  does not require complex software integration and interfacing and we have not experienced any difficulties installing such equipment 
in addition  the customer or other third party vendors can install the equipment 
the estimated relative fair value of the installation services is determined by management  which is typically less than the customer s contractual holdback percentage 
if the holdback is less than the fair value of installation  we will defer recognition of revenues  determined on a contract by contract basis equal to the fair value of the installation services 
payments received in advance by customers are deferred until shipment and are presented as deferred revenues 
we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting upon the achievement of certain contractual milestones in accordance with statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  for our non standard  complex production type contracts for the production of satellite ground segment systems and equipment that are generally integrated into the customer s satellite ground segment network 
the equipment and systems produced in connection with these contracts are typically long term in excess of twelve months in term and require significant customer specific engineering  drafting and design effort in order to effectively integrate all of the customizable earth station equipment into the customer s ground segment network 
these contracts generally have larger contract values  greater economic risks and substantive specific contractual performance requirements due to the engineering and design complexity of such systems and related equipment 
progress payments received in advance by customers are netted against the inventories balance 
the timing of our revenue recognition is primarily driven by achieving shipment  final acceptance or other contractual milestones 
project risks including project complexity  political and economic instability in certain regions in which we operate  export restrictions  tariffs  licenses and other trade barriers which may result in the delay of the achievement of revenue milestones 
a delay in achieving a revenue milestone may negatively impact our results of operations 
costs from infrastructure solutions costs related to our production type contracts and our non standard  complex production type contracts rely on estimates based on total expected contract costs 
typically  these contracts are fixed price projects 
we use estimates of the costs applicable to various elements which we believe are reasonable 
our estimates are assessed continually during the term of these contracts and costs are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
these estimates are subjective based on management s assessment of project risk 
these risks may include project complexity and political and economic instability in certain regions in which we operate 
revisions in cost estimates are reflected in the period in which they become known 
a significant revision in an estimate may negatively impact our results of operations 
in the event an estimate indicates that a loss will be incurred at completion  we record the loss as it becomes known 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of businesses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other indefinite life intangible assets are no longer amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
the impairment test for goodwill uses a two step approach  which is performed at the reporting unit level 
step one compares the fair value of the reporting unit calculated using a discounted cash flow method to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  there is a potential impairment and step two must be performed 
step two compares the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its implied fair value ie  fair value of the reporting unit less the fair value of the unit s assets and liabilities  including identifiable intangible assets 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  the excess is required to be recorded as an impairment charge 
the impairment test is dependent upon estimated future cash flows of the services segment 
there have been no events during the year ended june  that resulted in any goodwill impairment 
deferred tax assets consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  fas we regularly estimate our ability to recover deferred income taxes  and report such deferred tax assets at the amount that is determined to be more likely than not recoverable  and we have to estimate our income taxes in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax expense together with assessing any temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of certain items  such as the timing for recognizing revenue and expenses for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences may result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we are required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets  which include net operating loss carry forwards and temporary differences that are expected to be deductible in future years  will be recoverable from future taxable income or other tax planning strategies 
if recovery is not likely  we have to provide a valuation allowance based on our estimates of future taxable income in the various taxing jurisdictions  and the amount of deferred taxes that are ultimately realizable 
the provision for current and deferred taxes involves evaluations and judgments of uncertainties in the interpretation of complex tax regulations 
this evaluation considers several factors  including an estimate of the likelihood of generating sufficient taxable income in future periods  the effect of temporary differences  the expected reversal of deferred tax liabilities and available tax planning strategies 
during the year ended june   based on positive evidence from our earnings trends  we recognized a portion of our deferred tax assets through a reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million 
as of june   we maintained a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to our prior history of pre tax losses and uncertainty about the timing of and ability to generate taxable income in the future and our assessment that the realization of the deferred tax assets did not meet the more likely than not criterion under fas at june   we had a deferred tax valuation allowance of approximately million primarily relating to million from net operating losses related to excess stock based compensation expense deductions 
if the remaining valuation allowance for the excess stock based compensation were to be reversed the amount would be recorded to additional paid in capital as it is attributable to the tax effects of excess compensation deductions from exercises of employee stock options 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
fin requires that the company recognize in its financial statements the benefits of tax return positions if that tax position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on its technical merits 
the provisions of fin became effective as of july  the adoption of this pronouncement on july  did not have an impact on the financial statements of the company 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the appropriate vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of stock options  and the expected volatility of our stock 
in addition  judgment is required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates or different key assumptions were used  it could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the customer s ability to pay based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
an assessment of the inherent risks in conducting our business with foreign customers is also made since a significant portion of our revenues is international 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate in the future  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories inventories consist primarily of work in progress from costs incurred in connection with specific customer contracts  which are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
in assessing the realizability of inventories  we are required to make estimates of the total contract costs based on the various elements of the work in progress 
it is possible that changes to these estimates could cause a reduction in the net realizable value of our inventories 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a common definition for fair value under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure requirements about such fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations revised sfas r 
sfas r provides additional guidance and standards for the acquisition method of accounting to be used for all business combinations 
charges for business combination transactions pursuant to sfas r include  among others  expensing acquisition related transaction costs as incurred  the recognition of contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair value and capitalization of in process research and development assets acquired at their acquisition date fair value 
fasr will be effective for all business combinations consummated beginning july  in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this statement provides a fair value option election that allows companies to irrevocably elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for certain financial assets and liabilities  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings as they occur 
sfas permits the fair value option election on an instrument by instrument basis at initial recognition of an asset or liability or upon an event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that instrument 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  accordingly  sfas is effective for us beginning on july  results of operations fiscal years ended june  and our consolidated results of operations for the fiscal year ended june  include results of the gsm business which have been included in the services segment for the full year 
in the fiscal year ended june   gsm business results include two months may and june since the acquisition in may revenues from infrastructure solutions 
revenues from infrastructure solutions increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in revenues was primarily driven by the increase in the systems design and integration services primarily due to a contract with a leading provider of telecommunication services in asia and an increase pre engineered systems product revenue in the government marketplace 
revenues from services 
revenues from services increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in revenue was primarily due to the increase of million of gsm revenue along with an increase within the content distribution services from a large program with showtime networks inc and an increase in the internet and data services  partially offset by a decrease in life cycle support services in the government marketplace and a decrease in telephony services 
costs from infrastructure solutions 
costs from infrastructure solutions increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was attributable to the higher revenue base

costs from services 
costs from services increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  gross margin increased to for the fiscal year ended june  compared to for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in the margin was primarily driven by gsm revenue along with an increase in revenue within the content distribution services from a large program with showtime networks inc  which has higher margin than the other service offerings 
the increase in gross margin in the services segment has been a key driver in the increase in our consolidated income from operations 
the future relationship between the revenue and margin growth of our operating segments will depend on a variety of factors  including the timing of major contracts  which are difficult to predict 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended june  from million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase is a result of an increase in selling and marketing expenses incurred at gsm of million along with an increase in salary and salary related expenses for additional marketing personnel pursuing business in the government marketplace and travel and living expenses related to marketing efforts exploring new markets

on september   the company repaid the principal balance of the acquisition term loan 
benefit for income taxes 
during fiscal we recorded a non recurring tax benefit of million primarily due to our recognition of a significant portion of our deferred tax assets through a reduction in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance based on positive evidence from our earnings trends 
in fiscal we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately

net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year ended june  was million which primarily related to the purchase of network operations center and teleport assets and the completion of the upgrade of our hauppauge facility to meet the requirements of the increased business levels 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year ended june  was million  which related primarily to proceeds from the offering of million and million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants  partially offset by the repayment of the acquisition term loan of million 
in august and september we completed an offering of equity securities totaling  in gross proceeds 
we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we incurred total expenses of approximately  of which approximately  represented underwriting discounts and commissions and approximately  represented other expenses which resulted in net proceeds of approximately  on january   we entered into a secured credit facility with citibank  n 
a  which expires on december  the credit facility is comprised of a million borrowing base line of credit the line and a foreign exchange line in the amount of million 
the line includes the following sublimits a million available for standby letters of credit  b million available for commercial letters of credit  c million term line to be used for acquisitions  and d million available for direct borrowings 
advances under the line bear interest at the prime rate or libor plus basis points  at our discretion  and is collateralized by a first priority security interest on all of our assets 
we are required to comply with various ongoing financial covenants  including with respect to the leverage ratio  liquidity ratio  minimum cash balance  debt service ratio and minimum capital base  with which we were in compliance at june  the credit facility is uncommitted and advances are subject to citibank  na s approval 
as of june   no borrowings were outstanding under this credit facility  however  there were standby letters of credit of approximately million  which were applied against and reduced the amounts available under the credit facility 
we lease satellite space segment services and other equipment under various operating lease agreements  which expire in various years through fiscal future minimum lease payments due on these leases through june  are approximately million 
we expect that our cash and working capital requirements for operating activities will increase as we continue to implement our business strategy 
management anticipates additional working capital requirements for work in progress for orders as obtained and that we may periodically experience negative cash flows due to variances in quarter to quarter operating performance and if cash is used to fund any future acquisitions of complementary businesses  technologies and intellectual property 
no acquisitions are currently at a stage which are probable of completion 
we will use existing working capital and  if required  use our credit facility to meet these additional working capital requirements 
our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the success of our marketing efforts in the infrastructure solutions and services business  the nature and timing of customer orders and the level of capital requirements related to the expansion of our service offerings 
based on current plans  we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements at least through june  however  we cannot assure you that there will be no unforeseen events or circumstances that would consume available resources significantly before that time 
additional funds may not be available when needed and  even if available  additional funds may be raised through financing arrangements and or the issuance of preferred or common stock or convertible securities on terms and prices significantly more favorable than those of the currently outstanding common stock  which could have the effect of diluting or adversely affecting the holdings or rights of our existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are unavailable  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some of our operating activities  including  without limitation  capital expenditures  research and development activities  the timing and extent of our marketing programs  and we may be required to reduce headcount 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to a variety of risks  including foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations relating to certain purchases from foreign vendors 
in the normal course of business  we assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations is to reduce the impact of adverse fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with foreign currency exchange rates 
accordingly  we may utilize from time to time foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments denominated in foreign currency 
at june   we had no significant outstanding foreign exchange contracts 
our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our variable interest rate long term debt and from our investment of available cash balances in money market funds with portfolios of investment grade corporate and government securities 
under our current positions  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes
