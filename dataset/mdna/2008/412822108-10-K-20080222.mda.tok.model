other matters accounting changes in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the company adopted the provisions of fin on january  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the effect of adopting fin on the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas no 
requires employers that sponsor defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans to recognize previously unrecognized actuarial losses and prior service costs in the statement of financial position and to recognize future changes in these amounts in the year in which changes occur through comprehensive income 
as a result  the statement of financial position will reflect the funded status the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets of those plans as an asset or liability 
additionally  employers are required to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position 
the company adopted sfas no 
 as it relates to recognizing the funded status of its defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans  and the related disclosure requirements  as of december  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the effect of adopting sfas no 
on the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
the requirement to measure the funded status as of the date of the year end statement of financial position is required by december  the company is currently evaluating the impact the change in the measurement date will have on its consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  clarifies the definition of fair value within that framework  and expands disclosures about the use of fair value measurements 
sfas applies to fair value measurements required by existing accounting pronouncements and does not require any new fair value measurements 
the company is required to adopt sfas beginning in fiscal year and the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on its consolidated financial statements is expected to be immaterial 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the company is required to adopt sfas beginning in fiscal year the company does not expect to elect the fair value option permitted under sfas so adoption will have no impact on its consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates the company s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
finance receivable securitizations the company sells retail motorcycle loans through securitization transactions utilizing qualifying special purpose entities qspes as defined by sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
upon sale of retail loans in a securitization transaction  hdfs receives cash and retains an interest in excess cash flows  servicing rights and cash reserve account deposits  all of which are collectively referred to as retained interests in the securitized receivables 
retained interests are carried at fair value and are periodically reviewed for impairment 
market value quotes are generally not available for retained interests  therefore  hdfs estimates fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows using management s best estimates of the key assumptions for credit losses  prepayment speeds and discount rates 
the impact of changes to key assumptions is shown in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
gains or losses on current year securitizations from the sale of retail loans are recorded as a component of financial services income and are based in part on certain assumptions including expected credit losses  prepayment speed  and discount rates 
gains or losses on sales of retail loans also depend on the original carrying amount of the retail loans  which is allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
finance receivable credit losses the allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover the losses of principal in the existing finance receivables portfolio 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is generally based on hdfs past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  current economic conditions  specific borrower s ability to repay and the estimated value of any underlying collateral 
product warranty estimated warranty costs are reserved for each motorcycle at the time of sale 
the warranty reserve is an estimated cost per unit sold based upon historical company claim data used in combination with other known factors that may affect future warranty claims 
the company updates its warranty estimates quarterly to ensure that the warranty reserves are based on the most current information available 
the company believes that past claim experience is indicative of future claims  however  the factors affecting actual claims can be volatile 
as a result  actual claims experience may differ from estimated which could lead to material changes in the company s warranty provision and related reserves 
the company s warranty liability is discussed further in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
pensions and other postretirement benefits retirement plan pension  serpa and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
the valuation of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs relies on key assumptions including discount rates  long term expected return on plan assets  future compensation and healthcare cost trend rates 
the company evaluates and updates all of its assumptions annually on september  the actuarial measurement date 
the company determines its discount rate assumptions by referencing high quality long term bond rates that are matched to the duration of its own benefit obligations 
based on this analysis  the discount rate was increased from as of september  to as of september  the company determines its healthcare trend assumption by considering factors such as estimated healthcare inflation  the utilization of healthcare benefits and changes in the health of plan participants 
based on the company s assessment of this data as of september   the company lowered its healthcare cost trend rate to from as of september  the company expects the healthcare cost trend rate to reach its ultimate rate of beginning in these assumption changes were reflected immediately in the benefit obligation and will be amortized into net periodic benefit costs over future periods 
the following information is provided to illustrate the sensitivity of pension and postretirement healthcare obligations and costs to changes in these major assumptions in thousands impact amounts based impact of a of a increase on current decrease in the in the healthcare assumptions discount rate cost trend rate net periodic benefit costs pension and serpa n a postretirement healthcare benefit obligations pension and serpa n a postretirement healthcare this information should not be viewed as predictive of future amounts 
the calculation of retirement plan obligations and costs is based on many factors in addition to those discussed here 
this information should be considered in combination with the information provided in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
stock compensation costs the total cost of the company s share based awards is equal to the grant date fair value per award multiplied by the number of awards granted adjusted for forfeitures 
this cost is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the service periods of the awards 
forfeitures are initially estimated based on historical company information and subsequently updated over the life of the awards to ultimately reflect actual forfeitures 
as a result  changes in forfeiture activity can influence the amount of stock compensation cost recognized from period to period 
the company generally determines the number of share based awards granted by first determining the total cost of the award  which is a function of employee salary  level and performance 
on the date of grant  the number of awards granted is then computed by dividing the total cost of the award by the grant date fair value of the award unit 
the company estimates the fair value of option awards as of the grant date using a lattice based option valuation model which utilizes ranges of assumptions over the expected term of the options  including stock price volatility  dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
the valuation model uses historical data to estimate option exercise behavior and employee terminations 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the option valuation model and represents the average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the company used implied volatility to determine the expected volatility of its stock in in and  expected volatilities were based on the historical volatility of the company s stock 
the company believes that implied volatilities provide a better estimate of expected volatilities because it takes into account both historical and future expectations of volatility 
the implied volatility is derived from options that are actively traded and the market prices of both the traded options and underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date reasonably close to the grant date of the employee share options 
in addition  the traded options have exercise prices that are both a near the money and b close to the exercise price of the employee share options 
finally  the remaining maturities of the traded options on which the estimate is based are at least one year 
dividend yield was based on the company s expected dividend policy and the risk free rate was based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
changes in the valuation assumptions could result in a significant change to the cost of an individual option 
however  the total cost of an award is also a function of the number of awards granted  and as result  the company has the ability to manage the cost and value of its equity awards by adjusting the number of awards granted 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis  the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period 
on a quarterly basis  the actual effective tax rate is adjusted as appropriate based upon the actual results as compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year 
the company is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s worldwide provision for income taxes and recording the related deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in the ordinary course of the company s business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
accruals for unrecognized tax benefits are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
an unrecognized tax benefit represents the difference between the recognition of benefits related to exposure items for income tax reporting purposes and financial reporting purposes 
the unrecognized tax benefit is classified as a component of the income taxes payable account  which is included within other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company has a reserve for interest and penalties on exposure items  if applicable  which is recorded as component of the overall income tax provision 
the company is regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although the outcome of tax audits is always uncertain  management believes that it has appropriate support for the positions taken on its tax returns and that its annual tax provision includes amounts sufficient to pay any assessments 
nonetheless  the amounts ultimately paid  if any  upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ materially from the amounts accrued for each year 
contractual obligations a summary of the company s expected payments for significant contractual obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands thereafter total principal payments on finance debt interest payments on finance debt operating lease payments as described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  as of december   long term finance debt issued by hdfs included outstanding commercial paper and advances under the global credit facility totaling million 
the amount classified as long term is supported by the global credit facility  due september  accordingly  the company has assumed that this amount will be repaid in interest obligations include the impact of interest rate hedges outstanding as of december  interest for floating rate instruments  as calculated above  assumes december  rates remain constant 
as of december   the company had no material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property  plant and equipment which generally have terms of less than days 
the company has long term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans at december  due to the current funded status of the pension plans  the company has no minimum funding requirements for the company s expected future contributions to these plans are provided in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company has unrecognized tax benefits of million and accrued interest and penalties of million as of december  however  the company cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate for the period of cash settlement for either the million of liability of unrecognized tax benefits or accrued interest and penalties of million 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of its securitization program  hdfs transfers retail motorcycle loans to a special purpose bankruptcy remote wholly owned subsidiary 
the subsidiary sells the retail loans to a securitization trust in exchange for the proceeds from asset backed securities issued by the securitization trust 
the asset backed securities  usually notes with various maturities and interest rates  are secured by future collections of the purchased retail installment loans 
activities of the securitization trust are limited to acquiring retail loans  issuing asset backed securities and making payments on securities to investors 
due to the nature of the assets held by the securitization trust and the limited nature of its activities  the securitization trusts are considered qspes as defined by sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 assets and liabilities of the qspes are not consolidated in the financial statements of the company 
hdfs does not guarantee payments on the securities issued by the securitization trusts or the projected cash flows from the related loans purchased from hdfs 
the company s retained securitization interests  excluding servicing rights  are subordinate to the interests of securitization trust investors 
such investors have priority interests in the cash collections on the retail loans sold to the securitization trust after payment of servicing fees and in the cash reserve account deposits 
these priority interests ultimately could impact the value of the company s investment in retained securitization interests 
investors also do not have recourse to assets of hdfs for failure of the obligors on the retail loans to pay when due 
total investment in retained securitization interests at december  was million 
the securitization trusts have a limited life and generally terminate upon final distribution of amounts owed to the investors in the asset backed securities 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of hdfs securitization program

in july  the york facility was designated as the first site in pennsylvania to be addressed under the one cleanup program 
the program provides a more streamlined and efficient oversight of voluntary remediation by both padep and epa and will be carried out consistent with the agreement with the navy
