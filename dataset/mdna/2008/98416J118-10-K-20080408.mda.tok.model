recent developments our credit facility requires that we meet certain operating requirements and financial ratios in order to avoid a default or event of default under the facility 
see credit facility below 
we were in compliance with the financial ratio covenants at december  while we have not completed our calculations for the covenants for the period ended march   we anticipate we will be in default of our leverage ratio covenant and possibly our interest coverage ratio covenant for the period ended march   although we expect to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service the debt under the credit facility prior to the stated maturity of the debt if there is not otherwise an event of default and acceleration of the maturity of the debt 
our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements related to the uncertainty in our ability to continue as a going concern 
the inclusion of that paragraph in its report also constitutes a default under our credit facility 
on april   we obtained a temporary waiver from the lenders for these defaults 
the waiver is in effect until may  because the existing financial ratio covenants become more restrictive over time  we do not expect to be in compliance with certain financial ratio covenants for future periods as well 
in the event that the lenders under our credit facility decline to provide the company with a further waiver of past and then existing defaults for periods subsequent to may   the lenders would have the right to demand immediate repayment of such obligations under the credit facility 
any such acceleration of the company s obligations would likely cause other lenders and contractual counterparties  including counterparties to our interest rate swap agreements and other hedge agreements to terminate and or to accelerate the company s obligations under other financing and credit instruments and agreements 
should the lenders and or other counterparties demand immediate repayment of all of the company s obligations  the company expects that it would not be able to pay such obligations 
in such event  or even in the event that the lenders do not accelerate the company s obligations  the company and its subsidiaries may have to file for bankruptcy 
the company is in discussions with the lenders under its credit facility to amend the financial covenants  although no assurances can be given that the company will successfully amend such covenants  or amend such covenants in a manner sufficient to adequately reduce the risk of covenant default in the near future 
in connection with any such amendments  the lenders are likely to condition agreement on substantial increases in the fees and interest rate payable under the credit facility 
the company is also considering other strategic initiatives  which may include issuing equity or other securities to prepay a portion of our outstanding debt 
the reduction of debt would reduce the company s leverage ratio and  over time  increase the interest coverage ratio  putting aside any changes in the interest rates applicable to such ratio 
the company has retained an investment bank to assist it with these strategic initiatives 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such strategic initiatives on satisfactory terms 
the waiver agreement referred to above effects an amendment to our credit facility that prohibits us from paying dividends 
accordingly  we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we recorded a non cash charge for goodwill impairment of million and a related tax benefit thereon of million related to our roll covers segment based on assessments performed as of december  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 we are required to test goodwill at least annually for impairment  which we test annually as of december we determined  as of december   that our goodwill for the roll covers 
table of contents segment was impaired due to expectations of lower profitability and to the increased carrying value of the net assets in this segment due primarily to currency translation effects thereon 
overview we are a leading global manufacturer and supplier of two types of consumable products used primarily in the production of paper clothing and roll covers 
our operations are strategically located in the major paper producing regions of north america  europe  south america and asia pacific 
our products play key roles in the formation and processing of paper along the length of a paper making machine 
paper producers rely on our products and services to help improve the quality of their paper  differentiate their paper products  operate their paper making machines more efficiently and reduce production costs 
our products and services typically represent only a small fraction of a paper producer s overall production costs  yet they reduce costs by permitting the use of lower cost raw materials and reducing energy consumption 
paper producers must replace clothing and refurbish or replace roll covers regularly as these products wear down during the paper production process 
our products are designed to withstand extreme temperature  chemical and pressure conditions  and are the result of a substantial investment in research and development and highly sophisticated manufacturing processes 
we operate in two principal business segments clothing and roll covers 
in our clothing segment  we manufacture and sell highly engineered synthetic textile belts that transport paper as it is processed on a paper making machine 
clothing plays a significant role in the forming  pressing and drying stages of paper production 
because paper making processes and machine specifications vary widely  the clothing size  form  material and function is selected to fit each individual paper making machine and process 
in  our clothing segment represented of our net sales 
our roll cover products provide a surface with the mechanical properties necessary to process the paper sheet in a cost effective manner that delivers the sheet qualities desired by the paper producer 
roll covers are tailored to each individual paper making machine and process  using different materials  treatments and finishings 
in addition to manufacturing and selling new roll covers  we also provide refurbishment services for previously installed roll covers and manufacture spreader rolls 
additionally  we provide various related products and services to our customers  both directly and through third party providers  as a growing part of our overall product offering through our roll covers sales channels 
in  our roll cover segment represented of our net sales 
in  sales in other industrial applications outside of the paper industry  such as steel  plastics and textiles  accounted for of the net sales in each of our segments 
industry trends and outlook historically  demand for our products has been driven primarily by the volume of paper produced on a worldwide basis 
according to the food and agriculture organization of the united nations  the volume of paper productions between and increased at a compound annual growth rate of approximately from to risi expects the growth of global paper production from to to be slightly more than per annum 
we expect growth to be greater in asia  south america and eastern europe than in the more mature north american and western european regions 
historically the demand for our products has been driven primarily by the level of global paper production 
the profitability of paper producers has historically been highly cyclical due to wide swings in the price of paper  driven to a high degree by the oversupply of paper during periods when paper producers have more aggregate capacity than the market requires 
a sustained downturn in the paper industry  either globally or in a 
table of contents particular region  can cause paper manufacturers to reduce production or cease operations  which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
paper producers began in to take actions that seek to structurally improve the balance between the supply of and demand for paper 
as part of these efforts  they have shut down many paper making machines 
between and the bulk of these closures occurred in north america and announcements by paper producers for shutdowns of paper making machines in north america have continued  although at a reduced level compared to through in  and  there was an increase in the number of planned shutdowns of paper making machines in europe  although not at the level experienced in recent years in north america 
during  and  the sales and profitability of our north american and european operations were adversely affected by these shutdowns 
papermakers continue to experience low levels of profitability  and we believe that further consolidation among papermakers  reducing the number of paper producers  and shutdowns of paper making machines will occur in europe and north america  until there is a better balance between supply and demand for paper and the profit levels of paper producers improve 
we expect the balance between supply and demand to improve as the industry consolidates further and shuts down excess capacity 
in addition  consumption growth of paper is expected to drive an increase in the production rates required to maintain balance between supply and demand 
we expect that demand for our clothing products will grow in a manner consistent with global paper production trends but be moderated by the level of industry consolidation and paper machine shutdown activity in north america and western europe 
while we believe that growth of paper production would positively impact demand for our roll covers products  we also believe that  in addition to industry consolidation and paper machine shutdown activity in north american and western europe  the trend towards new paper machine designs which have fewer rolls and market recognition of extended life of our roll covers products has been and will continue to negatively impact demand for these products and that the volume potential for the roll covers business in north america and western europe will diminish 
additionally  we are seeing a trend that paper producers are placing an increasingly strong emphasis on maintenance cost reduction and as a result are extending the life of roll covers through additional maintenance cycles before replacing them 
accordingly  we are focused on both expanding our presence in the roll covers business in asia  as evidenced by our acquisition in november of two roll covers manufacturing plants in china  and adding related products and services to our offerings 
also  we have begun construction of a clothing manufacturing facility in vietnam in the fourth quarter of with the intent to take advantage of what we believe to be high growth potential in that region 
we expect to start production in vietnam during we anticipate that pricing pressure for our products  roll covers in particular  will continue to escalate with the consolidation among paper producers and as the shift of paper production growth in asia develops 
in response to this pricing pressure  we expect to increase our expenditure levels on research and development expenses and continue to develop our value added selling approach as part of our strategy to differentiate our products  while at the same time remaining focused on cost reduction and efficiency programs 
sales and expenses sales in both our clothing and roll covers segments are primarily driven by the following factors the volume of worldwide paper production  advances in the technology of our products  which can provide value to our customers by improving the efficiency of paper making machines  and our ability to provide products and services which reduce paper making machine downtime  while at the same time allowing the manufacture of high quality paper products 
sales in our roll covers segment include our mechanical services business 
we have expanded this business in response to demand from paper producers that we perform work on the internal mechanisms of a roll while we refurbish or replace a roll cover 
in our clothing segment  a small portion of our business has been conducted 
table of contents pursuant to consignment arrangements under which we do not recognize a sale of a product to a customer until the customer places the product into use  which typically occurs some period after the product is shipped to the customer or to a warehouse location near the customer s facility 
we are continuing to reduce the number of consignment arrangements and increasing the use of standard terms of sale under which we recognize a sale upon product shipment 
we expect this trend to continue  although at a slower pace than in the past few years 
our operating costs are driven primarily by our total sales volume  the impact of inflation and currency and the level and impact of cost reduction programs 
the level of our cost of products sold is primarily attributable to labor costs  raw material costs  product shipping costs  plant utilization and depreciation  with labor costs constituting the largest component 
we invest in facilities and equipment that enable innovative product development and improve production efficiency and costs 
recent examples of capital spending for such purposes include faster weaving looms and seaming machines with accurate electronic controls  automated compound mixing equipment and computer controlled lathes and mills 
the level of research and development spending is driven by market demand for technology enhancements  including both specific customer needs and general market requirements  as well as by our own analysis of applied technology opportunities 
with the exception of purchases of equipment and similar capital items used in our research and development activities  all research and development is expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
foreign exchange we have a geographically diverse customer base 
in  approximately of our sales was in north america  was in europe  was in south america  was in asia pacific and was in the rest of the world 
a substantial portion of our sales is denominated in euros or other currencies 
as a result  changes in the relative values of us dollars  euros and other currencies affect our reported levels of revenues and profitability as the results are translated into us dollars for reporting purposes 
in particular  decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to the value of the euro and these other currencies positively impact our levels of revenue and profitability because the translation of a certain number of euros or units of such other currencies into us dollars for financial reporting purposes will represent more us dollars 
for certain transactions  our sales are denominated in us dollars or euros but all or a substantial portion of the associated costs are denominated in a different currency 
as a result  changes in the relative values of us dollars  euros and other currencies can affect the level of the profitability of these transactions 
the largest proportion of such transactions consist of transactions in which the sales are denominated in or indexed to us dollars and all or a substantial portion of the associated costs are denominated in euros  reals or other currencies 
currency fluctuations have a greater effect on the level of our net sales than on the level of our income loss from operations 
for example  in as compared to  the change in the value of the us dollar against the currencies we conduct our business in resulted in currency translation increases in net sales and income from operations of million and million  respectively 
although the results reflect a period in which the value of the us dollar decreased as compared to  we would expect a similar but opposite effect in a period in which the value of the us dollar increases 

table of contents during  we conducted business in foreign currencies 
the following table provides the average exchange rate in and of the us dollar against each of the five foreign currencies in which we conduct the largest portion of our operations  and indicates the percentage of our net sales in and denominated in each such foreign currency 
currency average exchange rate of the us dollar in average exchange rate of the us dollar in euro euro euro canadian dollar canadian dollar canadian dollar brazilian real brazilian real brazilian real australian dollar australian dollar australian dollar british pound british pound british pound currency percentage of net sales denominated in such currency percentage of net sales denominated in such currency euro canadian dollar brazilian real australian dollar british pound to mitigate the risk of transactions in which a sale is made in one currency and associated costs are denominated in a different currency  we utilize forward currency contracts in certain circumstances to lock in exchange rates with the objective that the gain or loss on the forward contracts will approximate the loss or gain that results from the transaction or transactions being hedged 
we determine whether to enter into hedging arrangements based upon the size of the underlying transaction or transactions  an assessment of the risk of adverse movements in the applicable currencies and the availability of a cost effective hedge strategy 
to the extent we do not engage in hedging or such hedging is not effective  changes in the relative value of currencies can affect our profitability 
cost reduction programs an important part of our strategy is to seek to reduce our overall costs and improve our competitiveness 
as a part of this effort  we have engaged in a series of cost reduction programs since  which were designed to improve the cost structure of our operations in north america  south america and europe  in response to changing market conditions 
these cost reduction programs include headcount reductions throughout the world as well as plant closures that have rationalized production among our facilities to better enable us to meet customer demands 
our cost reduction efforts between and included the closing of nine manufacturing facilities and the movement of certain production from two other facilities 
four facilities were closed in the clothing segment  of which three were in north america and one was in the united kingdom and we closed five facilities in the rolls segment  three of which were in north america and two were in the united kingdom 
from to  we eliminated approximately positions in connection with our cost reduction efforts 
as a result of these actions  offset by other changes in workforce  our headcount decreased by approximately positions during that period 
in  we charged a total of million for restructuring and impairments related expense 
during  we closed the clothing manufacturing facility and a small roll covers manufacturing facility in the united kingdom which resulted in restructuring and impairments expense of million in also in  we reorganized our european roll covers business primarily through the realignment of administrative functions and 
table of contents headcount reductions 
these programs resulted in restructuring and impairments expenses of million in the closures of facilities under restructuring programs that were commenced prior to resulted in a charge of approximately million during in  we charged a total of million for restructuring and impairments related expense of which i million related to the reorganization of our european management structure along functional lines  ii million related to impaired assets  primarily in the united kingdom  as discussed below and iii million related to the closures of facilities under restructuring programs that were commenced prior to in  we charged a total of million for restructuring and impairments related expense as follows i in march  we ceased manufacturing activity at our roll covers manufacturing facility in the united kingdom and recorded restructuring expenses of million related thereto 
we had recorded asset impairment charges of million related to this facility during the fourth quarter of  ii in the first quarter of  the company also initiated the closure of a roll covers manufacturing facility in the us for which restructuring expenses and asset impairments of million and million  respectively  were recorded during  iii during the first quarter of  we initiated a program to streamline our operating structure for which restructuring expenses of million were recorded during we expect to incur additional restructuring expenses of approximately million during  primarily in north america and europe  to improve our manufacturing footprint to match market conditions and efficiencies in our operations 
we will continue to review our business to determine if additional actions can be taken to further improve our cost structure 
in addition  we have also initiated lean manufacturing and procurement initiatives designed to enhance the efficiency of our manufacturing process  which we believe will help offset the effect of inflation on our bottom line following the initial investments required for these initiatives 
costs for these initiatives are reflected in operating expenses

for  we had a foreign exchange loss of million compared to a foreign exchange gain of million for this million difference was primarily attributable to the manner in which swings in the value of the us dollar as compared to other currencies  primarily the euro and the brazilian real  affected certain intercompany transactions and  up until may   the reported amount of our external debt 
under our previously existing senior and mezzanine debt facilities  certain of our subsidiaries had debt denominated in currencies other than their functional currency and  as a result  the changes in relative exchange rates created a foreign exchange gain or loss 
under our current credit facility  the majority of amounts borrowed are denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary  which mitigates the amount of foreign exchange gain or loss related to external debt 
foreign exchange gains and losses since may  resulted primarily from intercompany activity 
provision for income taxes 
for and  we recognized a provision for income taxes of million and million  respectively 
our effective tax rate was for as compared with for in  the effective rate was lower than the us statutory rate of primarily due to i no tax provision recognition on million of the change in the fair value of our prior interest rate swaps  which were settled in november  because of our tax loss carryforward position and ii a tax benefit in the united kingdom of million  reflecting the reversal of a previously established valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  and a tax refund in the united states of million relating to a net operating loss carryback that had a previously established valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in  the tax provision was affected by certain transaction costs and by operating losses in taxing jurisdictions for which valuation allowances have been provided because of the uncertainty surrounding the future utilization of such net operating loss carryforwards 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources as described above under recent developments  we anticipate we will be in default of our leverage ratio covenant and possibly our interest coverage ratio covenant under our credit facility for the period ended march   although we expect to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service the debt under the credit facility prior to the stated maturity of the debt if there is not otherwise an event of default and acceleration of the maturity of the debt 
further  our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements related to the uncertainty in our ability to continue as a going concern 
the inclusion of this paragraph in its report also constitutes a default under our credit facility 
on april   we obtained a temporary waiver from the lenders for these defaults 
the waiver is in effect until may  in the event that the lenders under our credit facility decline to provide the company with a further waiver of past and then existing defaults for periods subsequent to may   the lenders would have the right to demand immediate repayment of the company s obligations under the credit facility 
any such acceleration of the company s obligations would likely cause other lenders and contractual counterparties  including counterparties to our interest rate swap agreements and other hedge agreements  to terminate and or to accelerate the company s obligations under other financing and credit instruments and agreements 
should the lenders and or other counterparties demand immediate repayment of such obligations  the company expects that it would not be able to pay such obligations 
in such event  or even in the event that the lenders do not accelerate the company s obligations  the company and its subsidiaries may have to file for bankruptcy 
the company is in discussions with the lenders under our credit facility to amend the financial covenants  although no assurances can be given that the company will successfully amend such covenants  or amend such covenants in a manner sufficient to adequately reduce the risk of default in the near future 
in connection with any such amendments  the lenders are likely to condition agreement on substantial increases in the fees and interest rate payable under the credit facility 
the company is also considering other strategic initiatives which may include issuing equity or other securities to repay a portion of our outstanding debt 
the company has retained an investment bank to assist it with these strategic initiatives 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete any such strategic initiatives on satisfactory terms  or at all 
our principal liquidity requirements are for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service 
we expect to fund our liquidity requirements primarily with cash generated from operations and  to the extent necessary  through borrowings under our credit facility 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in   and  respectively 
the million increase in as compared with is primarily due to working capital changes 
the million increase in as compared with is primarily due to activities related to our initial public offering that occurred on may  which resulted in approximately million of payments of ipo related costs  approximately million of payments to the prior parent company to cover its liabilities and million of accelerated cash interest payments 
partially offsetting the increase in was a decrease in working capital items  primarily as a result of decreased accounts payable and accrued expenses  as compared with net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively

additionally  the decrease during as compared with was primarily the result of million of dividend payments to our shareholders during compared to million during as we did not begin making dividend payments to our shareholders until after the completion of our initial public offering  the first of which was made on september  we also made voluntary repayments of senior debt in of million and paid million of fees related to the amendments of our credit facility in as of december   there was a million balance of term loans outstanding under our senior credit facility 
during  we have made principal payments of million as required under the term loan 
in addition  as of december   we had an aggregate of million outstanding under our revolving lines of credit  including the revolving credit facility under our senior credit facility and lines of credit in various foreign countries that are used to facilitate local short term operating needs  and an aggregate of million available for additional borrowings under these revolving lines of credit 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures we use the term capital expenditures to refer to costs incurred to purchase property and equipment 
the majority of our capital expenditures relate to purchases of machinery and equipment used in the manufacturing of our products 
capital expenditures were funded from net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
during  we had capital expenditures of million consisting of approximately million of growth capital expenditures and approximately million of maintenance capital expenditures 
growth capital expenditures consist of items that are intended to increase the manufacturing  production and or distribution capacity or efficiencies of our operations in conjunction with the execution of our business strategies 
maintenance capital expenditures are designed to sustain the current capacity or efficiency of our operations and include items relating to the renovation of existing manufacturing or service facilities  the purchase of machinery and equipment for existing manufacturing or service facilities and safety and environmental needs 
during  we had capital expenditures of million consisting of approximately million of growth capital expenditures and approximately million of maintenance capital expenditures 
during  we had capital expenditures of million consisting of approximately million of growth capital expenditures and approximately million of maintenance capital expenditures 
we are expanding production capacity in brazil and building a clothing manufacturing facility in vietnam  which we began in the fourth quarter of in connection with these actions and other planned capital 
table of contents expenditures  we expect capital expenditures for to be approximately million 
in the first quarter of we determined to slow the pace of planned capital expenditures for the vietnam facility and now plan to begin production at that facility in we expect that capital expenditures in will be lower than those for we analyze our planned capital expenditures based on investment opportunities available to us and our financial and operating performance  and accordingly  actual capital expenditures for may be more or less than this amount 
see credit facility below for a description on limitations on capital expenditures imposed by our credit facility 
initial public offering on may  we completed our initial public offering  with a related debt refinancing  and a reorganization 
prior to the offering  xerium technologies  inc was an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of xerium sa  subsequent to the offering  we directly or indirectly hold all of the operating subsidiaries and related holding companies of the former corporate group of xerium sa  excluding the former parent  xerium sa  and two holding company subsidiaries of xerium sa  xerium sa and xerium sa the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented reflect the operations of xerium technologies  inc and its subsidiaries after the effect of this reorganization 
prior to the offering  xerium technologies  inc had outstanding one share of par value common stock that was held by xerium sa in connection with the offering  we effected a  for stock split of this common stock and accordingly  all share and per share amounts related to common stock included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been presented as if this stock split had occurred as of the earliest period presented 
in connection with the offering  xerium technologies  inc issued  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share and entered into a million credit facility agreement  under which million was borrowed in connection with the offering and which has a seven year maturity 
in connection with the offering  we repaid million of principal and interest on the previously existing senior bank debt  mezzanine bank debt and certain non interest bearing shareholder notes  as well as million of contractual payments under various rate swap agreements which were used to hedge the floating rate senior and mezzanine debt 
we wrote off million of deferred financing costs related to the repayment of this debt as of may   which is classified as loss on early extinguishment of debt in the accompanying statements of operations 
costs related to our reorganization  debt recapitalization and the offering include the following million of fees and expenses including i million to underwriters charged against paid in capital  ii million to arrangers and lenders capitalized as deferred financing costs and iii million of other fees and expenses including million related to the offering and charged against paid in capital  million related to the debt recapitalization and capitalized as deferred financing costs and million charged to interest expense related to contractual payments under various rate swap agreements which were used to hedge the floating rate of previously existing senior and mezzanine debt  million of non cash compensation expense related to the vesting of stock options and restricted stock in connection with the offering charged to general and administrative expense  million in compensation expense for the portion of cash transaction bonuses that were paid to members of our management team in connection with the offering charged to general and administrative expense 

table of contents in addition  xerium technologies  inc distributed million to xerium sa to reimburse xerium sa for certain pre closing liabilities and million to xerium sa to fund certain expenses expected to be incurred by xerium sa following the offering 
prior to the offering  we had outstanding million of non interest bearing loans 
upon the closing of the offering  we repaid million of these loans with cash  the remaining million was repaid by xerium sa with an obligation to deliver shares of xerium technologies  inc this repayment with shares is considered to be a capital contribution to xerium technologies  inc in connection with the offering  directors and members of our senior management who owned common stock of xerium sa or held options to purchase common stock of xerium sa transferred their equity interests in xerium sa to xerium technologies  inc in exchange for  shares of common stock of xerium technologies  inc we used the shares received in this exchange to redeem  shares of our common stock from xerium sa additionally  xerium technologies  inc received  shares of its common stock from xerium sa  which represented xerium sa shares held by a subsidiary of xerium technologies  inc that were not allocated to the issuance of shares related to stock options that were exercised in connection with the offering 
these shares were subsequently retired 
in addition  million of the offering proceeds were used to purchase  shares of common stock from certain directors and members of senior management 
all such shares were retired by the company in connection with the offering 
upon completion of the offering  the total amount of our authorized capital stock consisted of  shares of 
par value common stock and  shares of par value preferred stock  of which  shares of common stock were outstanding and no shares of preferred stock were outstanding 
credit facility upon the completion of the initial public of offering of our common stock on may   we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a senior secured credit facility 
the credit facility has been amended four times on february   december   may  and april  the description of the credit facility below describes the facility as amended 
our credit facility provides for a million senior secured revolving credit facility and a term loan that had a total principal amount of million as of may in december  the funding of a legal reorganization of a portion of our international operations was completed and million of our previous million revolving credit facility was canceled 
because the term loan facility included portions denominated in euros and canadian dollars  in addition to a us dollar denominated portion  the outstanding principal on our term loan facility is affected by our currency exchange rates as well as principal repayments 
the credit facility  as amended  is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of most of our subsidiaries  subject to legal and tax considerations and requirements 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility and term loan facility bear interest  at our option  at either a libor plus the applicable margin or b the euribor rate plus the applicable margin  in addition to certain other mandatory costs associated with syndication in the european markets or c cdor plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin for libor term loans  libor revolving loans  euribor loans and cdor loans is set at  subject to an increase by in the event that the indebtedness under the senior credit facility is rated lower than b by moody s or lower than b by standard poor s 
in february  moody s reduced its rating of the senior credit facility to below b  triggering this increase in the applicable margin 
if the indebtedness under the credit facility subsequently achieves ratings of b or higher by moody s and b or higher by standard and poor s after having fallen below one or both of these levels  the applicable margin will be decreased by 
the applicable 
table of contents margin with respect to the revolving loans may be reduced by or based on a leverage test set forth in the credit agreement 
following the initial public offering we entered into interest rate swap agreements that would have effectively fixed through june   the interest rate on approximately of the term loan balance outstanding 
on november   the company settled these interest rate swaps in consideration for their cash value of million and entered into new interest rate swap arrangements that effectively fix  from a cash flow hedge perspective  the interest rate on approximately of the term loan portion of the company s credit facility through initially  the new interest rate swaps qualified for hedge accounting under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 

as a result of anticipated financial covenant non compliance for the period ended march   we classified as current on our balance sheet as of december  million of the long term debt under our senior credit facility 
accordingly  because this debt is potentially payable prior to the expiration of the underlying interest rate swaps  hedge accounting under sfas no 
was no longer applicable for these interest rate swaps and the mark to market decrease in their fair value of million was recorded as a charge to interest expense in the fourth quarter of as of december   the weighted average interest rate on the effectively fixed portion of the term loan facility was  the weighted average interest rate on the portion of the term loan facility not effectively fixed by interest rate swap contracts  based on the day libor  was 
the revolving credit facility has a year maturity and the term loan facility has a year maturity from the date of the agreement 
the credit facility provides for quarterly scheduled principal payments on the term loan of million through march and the remaining principal amount due at maturity in may the credit facility also requires us to prepay outstanding loans under the term loan facility under the following circumstances with of the net cash proceeds received by us from any sale  transfer or other disposition of any assets  subject to certain reinvestment rights and with an exemption for sales of up to  for any transaction or series of related transactions  exemption of the first million of cumulative net proceeds and exemption of up to an additional million of net proceeds from the sale of four identified manufacturing facilities  with of the net cash proceeds received by us from any insurance recovery or condemnation events  subject to certain exceptions and reinvestment rights and with an exemption for the first million of cumulative net insurance or condemnation proceeds  with of the net cash proceeds from the incurrence of any indebtedness by us  subject to customary exceptions  and on an annual basis with a percentage of the amount equal to our excess cash  that is our pre dividend free cash flow as defined in our credit facility and described below minus our actual dividend payments for the preceding fiscal year excluding the amount of dividends applied to newly issued or treasury shares of our common stock pursuant to a dividend reinvestment program  where such percentage is for  for and for each fiscal year thereafter 
we have made a mandatory prepayment of million and million in the first quarter of and  respectively 

table of contents our credit facility requires that we meet certain financial covenants in order to avoid a default or event of default under the facility 
these covenants are as follows our interest coverage ratio as of the end of any period set forth below must exceed the ratio set forth for such period period ratio fiscal quarters ending december  through june  fiscal quarters ending september  through march  fiscal quarters ending june  through december  fiscal quarters ending march  and june  fiscal quarters ending september  through march  our leverage ratio as of the end of any period set forth below must not exceed the ratio set forth for such period period ratio fiscal quarter ending december  fiscal quarters ending march  through september  fiscal quarters ending december  and march  fiscal quarters ending june  through december  fiscal quarters ending march  through december  fiscal quarters ending march  through march  our fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of any period set forth below must exceed the ratio set forth for such period period ratio fiscal quarter ending december  fiscal quarters ending march  and thereafter we were in compliance with the financial ratio covenants at december  for the four fiscal quarters ended december  our interest coverage ratio was  our leverage ratio was and our fixed charge coverage ratio was while we have not completed our calculations for the covenants for the period ended march   we anticipate that we will be in default of our leverage ratio covenant and possibly our interest coverage ratio for the period ended march   although we expect to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service the debt under the credit facility prior to the stated maturity of the debt if there is not otherwise an event of default and acceleration of the maturity of the debt 
further  as described below  our independent registered public accounting firm has included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our consolidated financial statements related to the uncertainty in our ability to continue as a going concern which also constitutes a default under our credit facility 
on april   we obtained a waiver from the lenders for these defaults 
the waiver is in effect until may  because the financial ratios become more restrictive over time  we do not expect to be in compliance with the financial ratios in future periods as well 
our credit facility defines consolidated investment expenditures for a particular fiscal year as the sum of a consolidated capital expenditures incurred in such fiscal year  b the aggregate consideration paid in respect of permitted acquisitions as defined in our credit facility in such fiscal year  c the aggregate amount of consolidated cash restructuring and growth programs programs intended to increase productivity and economic efficiency or our market share capacity  reduce cost structure  improve equipment utilization or provide additional regional capacity to better serve growth markets costs incurred in such fiscal year  d the aggregate amount of investments in subsidiaries which are not wholly owned by a borrower under the credit facility made in accordance with the credit facility in such fiscal year and e the aggregate amount of investments in excluded subsidiaries as defined in our credit facility made in accordance with the credit facility in such fiscal year 
the 
table of contents credit facility limits the amount of our consolidated investment expenditures in any given fiscal year to an amount not exceeding million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year  million for fiscal year and million for fiscal year  in each such case exclusive of excess cash amounts and net insurance and condemnation proceeds permitted to be spent on capital expenditures  provided that commencing with fiscal year the maximum amount is increased by amounts below the maximum not spent in prior years beginning with fiscal year and that the amount of consolidated investment expenditures may be increased by an amount  not to exceed million per fiscal year and million in the aggregate during the period from march  to may   with net asset sale proceeds resulting from certain asset sales contemplated by the credit facility 
as amended by the waiver agreement discussed below  our credit facility also prohibits the payment of dividends on our common stock 
on april   we entered into an amendment and waiver agreement with our lenders relating to our credit facility pursuant to which the lenders agreed to waive through may  the forbearance period any past and then existing defaults 
in connection with the waiver agreement  the company agreed that the lenders would not be required to make revolving loans during the forbearance period 
the waiver agreement also contains restrictive covenants including  but not limited to  requirements that the company operate its business in the ordinary course  not enter into any contract which will be binding or impose liabilities upon the company or its subsidiaries other than in the ordinary course of business  except as contemplated below and except in connection with any issuance of equity securities by the company  not i incur any indebtedness or create or become liable with respect to any contingent obligation other than contingent obligations permitted below  provided that the company may incur subordinated debt  so long as all of the net proceeds of such incurrence of subordinated debt are applied to prepay debt under the credit facility  ii forgive any indebtedness or other obligation other than customer receivables in connection with collection efforts in the ordinary course of business  iii make any loans  advances  dividends  capital contributions or any other investment  with certain exceptions or iv incur capital expenditures in excess of certain limitations  not i create any new subsidiaries or enter into any transaction of merger or consolidation  or liquidate  wind up or dissolve the company or any subsidiary  ii other than with limited exceptions  convey  sell  lease  sub lease  transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the company s business or assets  unless all of the net proceeds of such disposal are applied to prepay debt under the credit facility or iii acquire all or a substantial part of the business or assets of  or capital stock or other evidence of beneficial ownership of  any person or any unit or division thereof  other than the acquisition and sale of inventory in the ordinary course of business 
the waiver agreement also amends our credit facility to prohibit our payment of dividends 
in connection with the waiver agreement  the company expects to pay fees to the agent bank and the lenders in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
the company is in discussions with its lenders to amend the financial covenants of its credit facility although no assurances can be given that the company will successfully amend such covenants  or amend such covenants in a manner sufficient to adequately reduce the risk of default in the near future 
in connection with any such amendments  the lenders are likely to condition agreement on substantial increases in the fees and interest rate payable under the credit facility 
dividends on common stock the waiver agreement referred to above prohibits us from paying dividends 
accordingly  we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
the elimination of dividends may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table provides aggregated information about our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years other in millions long term debt obligations interest expense on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations pension and other postretirement obligations fin obligations total contractual cash obligations reflects scheduled debt maturities under a waiver of the financial covenant noncompliance for the period ended march  see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
however  the accompanying balance sheet as of december  includes an adjustment of million to reflect the classification of the debt under the senior credit facility as current debt 
interest expense shown above is based on the effective interest rate as of december  as of december   the weighted average interest rate on the effectively fixed portion of the term loan facility was and the weighted average interest rate on the portion of the term loan facility not effectively fixed  based on the day libor  was 
the interest rate on approximately of the term loan portion of the credit facility is effectively fixed by interest rate swap contracts through december  includes obligations with respect to raw materials purchases  repair and maintenance services  utilities and capital expenditures 
amounts in other represent future cash outflows for which we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement 
balance sheet financing during the year ended december   we have not engaged in material off balance sheet activities  including the use of structured finance or special purpose entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have formal accounting policies in place including those that address critical and complex accounting areas 
note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report identify the significant accounting policies used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
derivatives and hedging 
we account for our derivative instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 

sfas no 
requires companies to record derivatives on their balance sheets as either assets or liabilities measured at their fair value 
all changes in the fair value of derivatives are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge criteria are met  which requires that a company must formally document  designate  and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 

table of contents there are two types of hedges into which we enter hedges of fair value exposure and hedges of cash flow exposure 
hedges of fair value exposure are entered into in order to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset or liability  or a firm commitment 
hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into in order to hedge a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be paid related to a recognized liability 
changes in derivative fair values are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of the related hedged assets and liabilities 
changes in the derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges which meet the criteria for hedge accounting are recorded in other comprehensive income 
the interest rate swaps entered into in november initially qualified for hedge accounting under sfas no 
as a result of anticipated financial covenant non compliance for the period ended march   we classified as current on our balance sheet as of december  million of the long term debt under our senior credit facility 
accordingly  because this debt is potentially payable prior to the expiration of the underlying interest rate swaps  hedge accounting under sfas no 
was no longer applicable for these interest rate swaps and the mark to market decrease in their fair value of million was recorded as a charge to interest expense during the fourth quarter of goodwill 
we account for acquired goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

purchase accounting required by sfas no 
involves judgment with respect to the valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities in order to determine the amount of goodwill 
we believe that the estimates that we have used to record prior acquisitions are reasonable and in accordance with sfas no 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we account for acquired goodwill and goodwill impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

this pronouncement requires considerable judgment in the valuation of acquired goodwill and the ongoing evaluation of goodwill impairment 
we perform an annual test for goodwill impairment as of december st at the business segment level 
we have two business segments clothing and roll covers 
when the company s business was acquired in  more than of the goodwill was assigned to the roll covers segment based on relative fair values at the date of acquisition 
in  segment earnings were million for the clothing segment and million for the roll covers segment 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process 
step involves comparing the fair value of the company s reporting unit to its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  there is no impairment 
if the reporting unit carrying amount is greater than the fair value then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
step calculates the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible assets  excluding goodwill  of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit as determined in step the implied fair value of goodwill determined in this step is compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference 
for the purpose of performing the annual impairment test we allocate all shared assets and liabilities to the business segments based upon the percentage of each segment s revenue to total revenue 
shared expenses are allocated to each segment to the extent necessary to allow them to operate as independent businesses 
fair value was determined by using a weighted combination of both a market multiple approach and an income approach 
the market multiple approach utilizes the company s proprietary information to determine measures that are used to value its business segments 
the income approach is a present value technique used to measure the fair value of future cash flows produced by each business segment 
determining the fair value of a business segment or an indefinite lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and operating margins  discount rates and future market conditions  among others 
we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our annual impairment test under sfas no 
are reasonable  but inherently uncertain 
based on these assessments performed as of december   we determined that our goodwill for the roll covers segment was impaired due to expectations of lower profitability 
table of contents and to the increased carrying value of the net assets of the roll covers segment due primarily to currency translation effects thereon 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash charge for goodwill impairment of million and a related tax benefit of million related to our roll covers segment 
step of the process indicated that the fair value of the net assets of the roll covers segment was million less than their carrying value as of december  based on the step result  the company proceeded with step based on the increase in fair value of tangible and intangible assets over book value of million as determined in step  an aggregate impairment of million was recorded 
there was no goodwill impairment recorded for the clothing segment during the year ended december   nor for either segment during the years ended december  or the excess of the fair value over the carrying value for our clothing segment as of december   the annual test date  was approximately million 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the analysis performed  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair value of this business segment  which resulted in a fair value in excess of carrying value of approximately million for the clothing segment 
contingencies 
we are subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits  insurance  tax  environmental and other issues arising out of the normal course of business 
our consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on management s view of the expected outcome 
we consult with legal counsel on those issues related to litigation with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable  we accrue a liability in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
while we believe that the current level of reserves is adequate  the adequacy of these reserves may change in the future due to new developments in particular matters 
in connection with the closure of certain manufacturing facilities under our restructuring programs  in  we had conducted environmental site assessments which had indicated contamination at two sites 
management believes that both sites have been substantially remediated and no significant further remediation costs are expected to be incurred 
during through  the company recorded environmental expenses of  in the aggregate and expenses income of   and during the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  the company paid approximately  related to the environmental remediation  which costs had been accrued as of december  management believes that the environmental issues at these two sites have been substantially remediated and we do not expect to incur significant additional costs related thereto 
income taxes 
we utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and statutes that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we have recognized a net deferred tax liability of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the deferred taxes relate principally to pension and post retirement benefits  intangible assets and differences between the book and tax bases of property and equipment 
we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
relevant evidence  both positive and negative  is considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years 
in light of our accumulated loss position in certain tax jurisdictions at december   and the uncertainty of profitability in future periods  we recorded valuation allowances for deferred tax assets primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards in the united states  united kingdom and sweden 

table of contents undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately million at december  those earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  no provision for income taxes or withholding taxes has been provided thereon 
upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we may be subject to both income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the various jurisdictions 
determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred us income tax liability or withholding taxes is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation  however  unrecognized foreign tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards would be available to reduce some portion of the liability 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues and rely on estimates and assumptions 
these audits may require an extended period of time to resolve and may cover multiple years 
although the company believes that the estimates and assumptions are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fas no 
fin prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company adopted fin on january  and  accordingly  recorded a cumulative effect increase of million to accumulated deficit  an increase of million to income taxes payable and an increase of million to deferred and long term taxes for uncertain tax positions upon adoption 
management cannot provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of related future payments for which settlement is expected to occur beyond the next twelve months 
postretirement plans 
we have various defined benefit plans 
we also have an unfunded plan to provide postretirement healthcare benefits to substantially all retired us employees 
we use assumptions  such as expected long term return on plan assets and discount rate  to determine our pension expense  and assumptions  as healthcare cost trend rate  to determine our postretirement health care expense 
we can not determine whether or how much future assumptions may change 
however  as of december   a increase or decrease in the following assumptions would increase decrease pension or postretirement expense  on a pre tax basis as follows in millions increase in discount rate expected long term return on plan asset healthcare cost trend rate increase decrease to pension postretirement expense decrease in discount rate expected long term return on plan asset healthcare cost trend rate increase decrease to pension postretirement expense

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency hedging 
we have foreign currency cash flow and earnings exposure with respect to specific sale transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the unit incurring the costs associated with such transactions 
to mitigate the risks related to this exposure  we utilize forward currency contracts in certain circumstances  to lock in exchange rates with the objective that the gain or loss on the forward contracts will approximate the loss or gain on the transaction or transactions being hedged 
we determine whether to enter into hedging arrangements based upon the size of the underlying transaction or transactions  an assessment of the risk of adverse movements in the applicable currencies and the availability of a cost effective hedging strategy 
in south america  substantially all of our sales are indexed to us dollars  but the associated costs are recorded in the local currencies of the operating units 
generally  we do not hedge this us dollar exposure as it would not be cost effective due to the relatively inefficient foreign exchange markets for local currencies in that region 
to the extent we do not engage in hedging or such hedging is not effective  changes in the relative value of currencies can affect our profitability 
the value of these contracts is recognized at fair value based on market exchange forward rates and amounted to a net asset position of million at december  these contracts mature at various dates through december relative to foreign currency exposures existing at december   a unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows because we hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
for contracts outstanding at december   a movement in foreign currency exchange rates from the rates as of our fiscal year end would have an immaterial impact on the fair value of our foreign currency financial instruments 
the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices 
for additional information about the risks associated with fluctuations in currency exchange rates  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations foreign exchange 
interest rate hedging 
our senior credit facility has a variable interest rate 
we had entered into interest rate swap contracts effective june  pursuant to which we paid fixed rates on notional amounts while receiving the applicable floating libor rates 
these interest rate swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
and the change in their fair value was subject to mark to market through earnings 
as a result of the mark to market accounting through earnings  we recorded a mark to market increase decrease to interest expense of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
although these interest rate swaps were subject to mark to market accounting through earnings  they were to have effectively fixed  from a cash flow hedge perspective  the interest rate on approximately of the term loan portion of the credit facility through june  on november   we settled these interest rate swaps in consideration for their cash value of million and entered into new interest rate swap arrangements that initially qualified for hedge accounting 
as a result of anticipated financial covenant non compliance for the period ended march   we classified as current on our balance sheet as of december  million of the long term debt under our senior credit facility 
accordingly  because this debt is potentially payable prior to the expiration of the underlying interest rate swaps  hedge accounting under sfas no 
was no longer applicable for these interest rate swaps and the mark to market decrease in their fair value of million was recorded as a charge to interest expense during the fourth quarter of the new interest rate swaps effectively fix  from a cash flow perspective  the interest rate on approximately of the term loan portion of the our credit facility through as of december   the weighted average interest rate on the effectively fixed portion of the term loan facility was  the weighted average interest rate on the portion of the term loan facility not effectively fixed by 
table of contents interest rate swap contracts  based on the day libor  was 
in february  the applicable margin for libor term loans  libor revolving loans  euribor loans and cdor loans under our senior credit facility increased from to as a result of moody s downgrade of its rating of our senior indebtedness 
we estimate that a increase in the libor rate would increase our interest expense on the term debt by approximately million on an annual basis through december  the period covered by the interest rate swap agreements 
to the extent that we do not enter into a hedging arrangement that effectively fixes the interest rate on a portion of our senior debt after these contracts expire  the interest rate on all of the debt covered by our senior credit facility will fluctuate based on libor and other variable interest rates 
to the extent these interest rates increase  our interest expense will increase  in which event  we may have difficulty making interest payments and funding our other costs and our ability to comply with the financial covenants in our credit facility may be adversely affected
