executive level overview we design  manufacture and market efficient  reliable and green critical power quality solutions and ups systems that provide business continuity and protect customers in the event of an electrical power disturbance 
our products are designed to provide power quality to protect customers from voltage fluctuations such as surges and sags  frequency fluctuations  and to also provide ride through  or temporary power to bridge the gap between a power outage and the restoration of utility power  or the time required to switch to electrical generator power 
our products are designed to be environmentally friendly compared to existing solutions without compromising functionality  efficiency or cost 
as of december   we have shipped more than  flywheels in ups system installations  delivering more than megawatts mw of power to customers in over countries around the world 
our patented flywheel energy storage systems store kinetic energy by constantly spinning a compact steel wheel flywheel driven from utility power in a low friction environment 
when the utility power used to spin the flywheel fluctuates or is interrupted  the flywheel s inertia causes it to continue spinning 
the resulting kinetic energy of the spinning flywheel generates electricity known as bridging power for short periods until utility power is fully restored or a backup electricity generator starts and takes over generating longer term power in the case of an extended electrical outage 
we sell our cleansource flywheel products to commercial and industrial customers across a variety of vertical markets  including manufacturing  technology  communications  utilities  healthcare  banking and military and in all major geographic regions of the world  but particularly in north america  western europe and asia 
to meet the requirements of customers without backup generators that require protection from utility disturbances  we have also developed a patented extended runtime product that we call coolair dc 
we initially have targeted coolair dc at lower power levels than our flywheel products  and it is sold as a minute for minute replacement for lead acid batteries 
coolair dc can provide backup power for several minutes to hours depending on the customer application 
coolair dc utilizes mature thermal and compressed air storage tacas technologies combined in a proprietary manner to produce backup power during an electrical disturbance 
this product discharges cool air as a by product of its backup power operation that also can be used by customers during an electrical disturbance as a transitional source of backup cooling 
during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated our level of coolair inventory compared to our historic and projected product demand 
this review also considered our planned future development efforts for the tacas technology as we migrate a dc only product into a more compelling customer solution with improved cooling capability and marketability 
as a result of this review we reserved million for excess inventory charges and recorded a  impairment charge against specific coolair manufacturing assets 
these costs were included as a component of cost of product revenue in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss 

table of contents our primary sales channels in north america have traditionally been through our oem partners  caterpillar  inc and eaton electrical formerly known as powerware 
since  we have developed additional sales channels in north america including direct sales employees and a network of manufacturer s representatives 
direct sales tend to improve our relationships with clients  improve our gross margins and add service and other revenue opportunities 
our primary sales channels in europe  middle east and asia emea include selling directly to end users and indirectly through select value added resellers vars 
we also provide services including engineering  installation  start up  monitoring  and repair for our products under contracts with our customers 
our revenue derived from customers located outside of the united states was million  million and million in  and  respectively  representing  and  respectively  of our total revenues 
during  in an effort to expand the territories in which we sell our active power branded products  we continued to increase our direct sales organization  particularly in emea 
we saw revenues in emea increase by in as a result of these efforts and we anticipate higher sales levels from this region in in  we also opened a sales office in japan and began selling directly in the asia pacific area 
sales of active power branded products through our direct sales and manufacturers representative channels were   and of our revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
total revenue in increased from due to continuing and increased market acceptance of our flywheel based products  especially our kva product line 
we achieved strong growth in both of our primary markets  north america and emea 
we believe revenues will continue to grow in from new product sales  in particular the megawatt class ups products  and from additional variations of our flywheel based products  including containerized versions that we intend to sell in to industrial manufacturers and it customers globally 
we believe that the investments we made during and in our sales organization to increase our level of direct sales staff  particularly in europe and north america  will contribute to improve sales results in we were able to improve our gross profit in and for the second consecutive year report a positive gross margin 
our gross profit margin  before the impairment charge for coolair inventory and related assets of million  was 
after the impairment charge  our gross profit margin was which was an improvement from the we achieved in and the in this improvement was due primarily to higher sales volumes  higher direct sales  and higher product pricing 
direct sales typically generate higher margins for us than sales that are made through our distribution channels 
our operating expenses included million for costs associated with an investigation into our historical stock option granting procedures that resulted in restatement of prior year financial statements 
excluding these costs and the coolair related charges of million  we were able to reduce our operating losses by million  or  after having reduced them in from this is primarily due to the gross margin improvements offset slightly by higher sales and marketing expenses due to the increase in our sales organization and lower operating expenses in development and administration 
non cash stock based compensation expense was million in which is a decrease over the million recorded in net cash used in operations improved by million  or  from primarily due to the lower operating losses  the non cash impairment charges  lower levels of stock based compensation  and better working capital management as reflected in a lower level of outstanding accounts receivable and higher levels of accrued expenses and deferred revenues 
we have a history of operating losses and have not yet reached operating profitability 
we believe that the success of our flywheel products and our new product developments  combined with our focus on direct sales and solution selling to customers will help us to reduce our level of operating losses and the amount of cash that we consume in our operations 
however  we expect to continue to incur operating losses for at least the next several quarters and for this will continue to consume our cash and 
table of contents investments 
our total cash and investments at december  were million compared to million at december  we believe that our cash and investments are sufficient to meet our operational needs for at least the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies and estimates we consider an accounting policy to be critical if the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain or require the use of judgment at the time we make that estimate  and changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we could have reasonably used instead in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed these disclosures 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in these and other items could still have a material impact upon our financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables are recorded at the stated amount  less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance represents estimated uncollectible receivables associated with potential customer defaults on contractual obligations  usually due to the customer s potential insolvency 
the allowance includes amounts for certain customers where a risk of default has been specifically identified 
in addition  the allowance includes a provision for customer defaults on a general formula basis when it is determined the risk of some default is probable and estimable  but cannot yet be associated with certain customers 
the assessment of the likelihood of customer defaults is based on various factors  including the length of time the receivables are past due  risks unique to particular geographic regions  historical experience and existing economic conditions 
historically  a large portion of our sales have been made through oem channels to a few large customers  and so our credit losses have been minimal 
as we integrate additional distribution channels into our business and increase our direct sales to more  and smaller customers  the risk of credit loss may increase 
inventories inventories are priced at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market 
we estimate inventory reserves on a quarterly basis and record reserves for obsolescence or slow moving inventory based on assumptions about future demand and marketability of products  the impact of new product introductions  inventory turns and specific identification of items  such as product discontinuance  damaged goods or engineering material changes 
accrued warranty liability the estimated warranty liability costs are accrued for each of our products at the time of sale 
our estimates are principally based on assumptions regarding the lifetime warranty costs of each product  including where little or no claims experience may exist 
due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of these estimates  changes in our assumptions could have a material effect on our reported operating results 
our estimate of warranty liability is reevaluated on a quarterly basis 
experience has shown that initial data for a new product can be very volatile due to factors such as product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs in correcting product failures  therefore our process relies upon long term historical averages until sufficient data is available 
as actual experience becomes available  it is used to modify the historical averages to ensure that the forecast is within the range of likely outcomes 
the resulting balances are then compared to current spending rates to ensure that the accruals are adequate to meet expected future obligations 

table of contents revenue recognition in general  revenue for product sales is recognized when title has transferred to the customer as stipulated by the delivery terms in a sales contract 
in addition  prior to revenue recognition we require persuasive written evidence of the arrangement  a fixed or determinable price  and a determination that collectibility is reasonably assured 
we also offer various services to customers depending on the type of product the customer has purchased  which may include on site services or installation and integration services 
such services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered product 
revenue for services is recognized at the time services are provided 
when products and services are contracted under a single arrangement  we allocate the total sales price to the multiple deliverables based on their relative fair values 
the fair value of our equipment is based on our average historical selling prices  while the fair value of services is based upon the rates that we charge customers in separately negotiated transactions or based on the market price an independent third party would charge to provide these services 
revenue associated with the sale of extended warranties is recognized ratably over the contract period 
stock based compensation beginning in we adopted sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation  using the modified prospective application method and began accounting for our stock based compensation using a fair value based recognition method 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating stock price volatility  expected option life and forfeiture rates 
we develop our estimates based on historical data and market information that can change significantly over time 
a small change in estimates used can have a relatively large change in the estimated valuation 
we use the black scholes option valuation model to value employee stock awards 
we estimate stock price volatility based upon our historical volatility 
estimated option life and forfeiture rate assumptions are derived from historical data 
for stock based compensation awards with graded vesting that were granted after  we recognize compensation expense using the straight line amortization method 
through  we accounted for our stock plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma income and per share data as if a fair value method had been used to account for stock based compensation 

table of contents results of operations comparison of to product revenue product revenue primarily consists of sales of our cleansource power quality products  comprising both ups and dc product lines  and sales of continuous power systems cps which are comprised of our ups systems and some combination of third party ancillary equipment  such as engine generators and switchgear 
beginning in  product revenue also includes sales of our coolair dc product and coolair ups products 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our product revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change product revenue represented and of total revenue for and  respectively 
the increase in product revenue from was due to million in increased sales of our kva product lines  as well as million in increased sales of ancillary equipment that we sold along with our ups products and million from higher coolair sales 
this was offset by a decrease in sales of our kva products of million from in  we sold flywheel product units  a decrease over the units that we sold in this decrease in volume was offset by our increase in average sales price per kva flywheel by to approximately  in from approximately  in the increase in average selling price is due to price increases and proportionately more wheels sold through our direct sales channel 
our direct sales channel typically has higher sales prices and profit margins compared to our oem channel as we do not have to offer channel discounts on our direct sales 
we expect this trend in mix and average selling price to continue 
the frequency and timing of our larger system sales  including megawatt class ups products  is more volatile and can result in material changes in period to period revenue 
such revenues also can occur in periods other than when originally anticipated  which can add to the potential volatility and affect our ability to meet forecasted targets 
larger system sales may also involve higher amounts of ancillary products upon which we typically generate lower profits when compared to sale of our ups products 
therefore  a significant increase in product revenues that was caused by higher sales of ancillary products may not result in a commensurate increase in our gross or operating profit levels 
north america sales were of our total revenue for compared to for we continued to expand the sales territories where we sell our active power branded products in as we increased our direct sales organization  particularly in europe and asia 
we opened new offices in japan during the year as part of this effort 
we also increased the size of our sales and service organization in the uk and europe 
we anticipate higher revenues from these locations in as a result 
caterpillar represented of our revenues in as compared to of our revenue in and remains our largest single customer as well as our largest oem customer 
our revenue from caterpillar increased by in  however this increase was smaller than the increase in our direct business in compared to as a result  caterpillar represented a smaller portion of our total revenue in we expect further growth in sales to caterpillar in as they enjoy success with their large engine generators  particularly in the megawatt and larger power applications 
we also have seen and anticipate a further increase in capital spending in datacenters where there is a requirement for higher density power solutions such as flywheels 
we believe that we may be able to capitalize on this trend  driving higher product revenue levels for us in 
table of contents in  we began to offer our coolair dc product for commercial sale 
sales of this new technology reached million in we have obtained important market feedback from these initial product sales and are now investigating the development of a next generation coolair product  which we anticipate will provide a substantial increase in bridging cooling integrated with a high efficiency ups to offer customers a more compelling business solution instead of a stand alone dc product 
system efficiencies are expected to be greatly improved  exceeding existing double conversion battery based ups products that do not provide cooling capabilities 
additional features such as a compact footprint combined with a user friendly architecture should make the future coolair product a preferred choice for deployment in small and medium sized data centers 
our products perform well in harsh environments where power quality is particularly poor  which makes them a good fit for industrial countries with a poor power infrastructure and therefore we have traditionally focused our direct sales efforts to these customers 
due to the large size of some of our customer orders relative to our current total revenue levels  our quarterly total revenue trend and the proportion of sales made directly by us can be expected to fluctuate 
we have also seen and anticipate a further increase in capital spending in data centers where there is a requirement for higher density power solutions such as flywheels  and believe that focusing sales at this market segment along with our expanding direct sales strategy will result in higher product revenue levels for us in service and spares revenue service and spares revenue primarily relates to revenue generated from installation  startup  repairs or reconfigurations of our products and the sale of spare or replacement parts to our oem and end user customers 
it also includes revenue associated with the costs of travel of our service personnel 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated a year over year comparison of our service and spares revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the increase in our installed base of customers  particularly those arising from direct sales made by us  is driving the trend of higher service and spares revenue 
our service and spares revenue in was also helped by our improved level of direct sales and large multi megawatt sales that affords us the ability to generate higher startup service revenues 
we anticipate that service and spares revenue will continue to grow as our product revenue increases and as our installed base of product expands because as more units are sold to customers  more installation  startup and maintenance services will be required 
where sales are made through an oem channel  our oem partner would typically provide these services to their end user customers 
thus  increasing direct sales gives us a greater opportunity to grow our service and spares revenues 
cost of product revenue cost of product revenue includes the cost of component parts of our products or ancillary equipment that are sourced from external suppliers  personnel  equipment and other costs associated with our assembly and test operations including costs from having underutilized facilities  shipping costs  warranty costs  and the costs of manufacturing support functions such as logistics and quality assurance 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our cost of product revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change gross margin 
table of contents the increase in cost of product revenue was driven by the increase in product revenues that we experienced in during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated our level of coolair inventory compared to our historic and projected product demand  and in light of planned future development efforts for the tacas technology as we migrate a dc only product into a more compelling customer solution with increased capability and marketability 
as a result of this review we reserved million for excess inventory charges and recorded a  impairment charge against specific coolair manufacturing assets 
we have been able to improve our gross product margins by increasing the average selling price of our products that we sell 
as a result  our product revenue increased more than the increase in the cost of product revenue 
this has been part of our strategy to improve the profitability of individual transactions and the profitability of the company as a whole 
we achieved a positive gross margin for the company for the first time in  and with higher product volume and higher product pricing in  we were able to improve our positive gross margin in to 
we believe that as our direct sales increase  our product margins will improve 
in  we increased sales of higher margin product options and features with the ups systems we sold  which lead to a further increase in our average selling price 
we have also continued to improve the efficiency and utilization of our manufacturing facility  which has a large portion of fixed costs 
we incur approximately million per year in fixed costs for our manufacturing facility that has a capacity in excess of our current business requirements 
we expense the excess costs of the underutilization of this facility as part of our cost of product revenues 
we now produce more goods with less overhead than in previous years 
some of this efficiency is driven by higher product volumes that allow for better utilization of our test facility and our manufacturing space 
we also have ongoing programs within our engineering and manufacturing departments to lower product costs  to identify alternative and cheaper vendors if possible  to reduce our absolute level of overhead spending and headcount  and to improve the manufacturability of our products 
these efforts have helped reduce our cost of product revenue and we anticipate further cost reductions in as we reduce our manufacturing space and make further cost reductions 
these benefits have been mitigated during by higher raw material and commodity price increases  but have allowed us to maintain prices despite the higher incoming costs of materials 
cost of service and spares revenue cost of service and spares revenue includes the cost of component parts that we use in service or sell as spare parts to customers  as well as the labor and overhead costs of our service organization  including travel and related costs incurred in fulfilling our service obligations to our customers 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated a year over year comparison of our cost of service and spares revenue in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change gross margin the increase of in the cost of service and spares revenue in is driven by the increase in service and spares revenue 
the increase also reflects the higher headcount and related expenses that we put in place during the year to expand our service capabilities around the world 
as our direct sales organization has expanded we have added service and technical personnel  including in many foreign markets  in order to support our selling efforts and to meet our customer responsibilities 
this increase in costs compares to the increase in service and spares revenue that we achieved in balancing our labor requirements to our customer needs will continue to be a business challenge for our service organization in  as we seek to ensure that we do not incur additional fixed labor costs in advance of anticipated service revenues 
maintaining the efficient utilization of our service labor will be key to profitably growing this area of our business 
many of the costs of the service organization are fixed in nature  and higher volume of installation  startup and service work is resulting in improved efficiency and operating results for this group 
we expect this trend to continue in 
table of contents research and development research and development expense primarily consists of compensation and related costs of employees engaged in research  development and engineering activities  third party consulting and development activities  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our research and development expense in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change our research and development efforts in were largely focused on new configurations of our existing flywheel technology under development  as well as enhancements to our megawatt class ups products 
the decrease in spending compared to is a result of significantly lower prototype expenses with the coolair product development as it neared production  and from lower salary expenses following a reduction in headcount that we made in the third quarter of this research and development expense included approximately  of stock based compensation 
we believe that research and development expenses will remain at current levels in although this will represent a smaller percentage of our total revenue  and that the spending will be focused on enhancements and cost reductions to our flywheel products  and continued improvements to the coolair products 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses primarily comprise compensation and related costs for selling and marketing personnel  and related travel  selling and marketing expenses  as well as an allocated portion of our occupancy costs 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our selling and marketing expense in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the increase in selling and marketing expenses in reflects the higher headcount and related costs as we have expanded our direct sales force in emea and north america and from higher variable compensation as our total revenues increase 
although the total headcount has not changed significantly  we have changed the composition of our sales organization from supporting oem partners to one supporting more direct selling during we have also increased our marketing department staffing as we concentrate on improving the active power brand  and supporting our direct selling activities 
the expense also includes approximately  of stock based compensation 
we anticipate that selling and marketing expenses will continue to increase in but reduce as a percentage of revenues as we expand our direct sales force into new geographies and due to higher variable compensation as our revenues continue to increase 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of compensation and related costs for executive and administrative personnel  professional fees  taxes  and the allowance for doubtful accounts expense 
the following table summarizes for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of our selling  general and administrative expense in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the increase in general and administrative expense from to was primarily attributable to million in expenses related to an investigation into our historical stock option granting procedures that resulted in restatement of prior year financial statements 
absent these expenses  our general and administrative expenses would have been lower than  reflecting our efforts to control costs and headcount and the resolution of our prior legal issues resulting in lower legal expenses 
we anticipate general and administrative expenses to decrease in due to the absence of the costs of the stock option investigation  which is now substantially complete 
we are currently in the process of negotiating to settle outstanding tax matters resulting from the option investigation with the internal revenue service  and may record additional expense to cover tax obligations for innocent employees who were affected by the option review 
we would record any further expenses at the time we legally finalize those obligations for our employees 
absent the impact of such expenses from the option review  we anticipate that the level of general and administrative expenses should stay at similar levels in interest income the following table summarizes the yearly changes in our interest income in thousands year annual amount change from prior year percent change the decrease in interest income from to is primarily attributable to the decrease in the amount of available funds that we had for investment as our operating losses decreased our cash reserves 
during the year  as part of our investment strategy  we moved more investments into short term instruments in reaction to the declining interest rate environment 
we expect interest income to fluctuate depending on cash and investment balances and trends in interest rates 
income tax expense due to operating losses  we have not recorded any income tax expenses  other than minimum or statutory costs 
as of december   our accumulated net operating loss carryforward was million and our research and development credit carryforwards were million 
we anticipate that these loss carryforward amounts may offset future taxable income that we may achieve and future tax liabilities  however  because of uncertainty regarding our ability to use these carryforwards and the potential limitations due to ownership changes  we have established a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets 

table of contents comparison of to product revenue product revenue represented of total revenue in both and the increase in product revenue from was due to higher sales of our kva and our megawatt class ups product lines which collectively saw sales increase by million from this was offset by a decrease in sales of our cleansource dc products and our lower power kva products 
we increased our average sales price per flywheel by to  in from  in due to price increases and due to proportionately more wheels sold through our direct sales channel 
our direct sales channel typically has higher sales prices and profit margins compared to our oem channel as we do not have to offer channel discounts on our direct sales 
in we sold flywheel product units  a increase over the units that we sold in this includes a significantly higher number of our megawatt class systems where we sold wheels in  up from in we continued to expand the territories in which we sold our active power branded products in as we increased our direct sales organization  particularly in europe and northern africa 
we opened new offices in algeria  germany and the uk during the year as part of this effort 
caterpillar represented of our revenues in as compared to of our revenue in and remains our largest single customer as well as our largest oem customer 
our revenue from caterpillar increased by in  however this increase was smaller than the increase in our direct business  which is why they now represent a smaller part of our total revenue 
in  we began to offer our new coolair dc product for commercial sale although the results were not significant 
service and spares revenue the increase in our installed base of customers  particularly those arising from direct sales made by us  is driving the trend of higher service and spares revenue 
our revenue in was also helped by our improved level of direct sales and large multi megawatt sales that affords us the ability to generate higher startup service revenues 
we anticipate that service and spares revenue will continue to grow as our product revenue increases and as our installed base of product expands because as more units are sold to customers  more installation  startup and maintenance services will be required 
where sales are made through an oem channel  our oem partner would typically provide these services to their end user customers 
thus  increasing direct sales gives us a greater opportunity to grow our service and spares revenues 
cost of product revenue the increase in cost of product revenues in reflects the higher unit volume of sales and production that we experienced 
the increase in cost of product revenue mirrors the increase in product revenues that we experienced in also included in cost of product revenues in was  of stock based compensation 
we have been able to improve our gross product margins by increasing the average selling price of our products that we sold 
was the first year that we have achieved a positive gross margin for the company 
as our direct sales increase  this will lead to improved product margins 
in  we increased sales of higher margin product options and features with the ups systems we sold  which lead to a further increase in our average selling price 
we have also continued to improve the efficiency and utilization of our manufacturing facility that has a large portion of fixed costs

cost of service and spares revenue the increase of in the cost of service and spares revenue in reflects the higher headcount and related expenses that we put in place during the year to expand our service capabilities 
as our direct sales organization has expanded we have added service and technical personnel  including in many foreign markets  in order to support our selling efforts and to meet our customer responsibilities 
this increase in costs compares to the increase in service and spares revenue that we achieved in many of the costs of the service organization are fixed in nature  and higher volume of installation  startup and service work is resulting in improved efficiency and operating results for this group 
research and development our research and development efforts in were largely focused on the completion and commercialization of our coolair dc product  and enhancements to our megawatt class ups products 
the decrease in spending compared to is a result of significantly lower prototype expenses with the coolair development as it neared production  and from lower salary expenses following a reduction in headcount that we made in the third quarter of this decrease was offset by approximately  of stock based compensation that we began recording as an expense in the expense included a  technology impairment charge that we incurred in the fourth quarter of related to certain technology license agreements that we entered into in and we had decided not to commercially pursue the underlying technology  but instead plan to focus our development efforts on our existing flywheel and coolair product families 
selling and marketing the increase in selling and marketing expenses in reflects the higher headcount and related costs as we have expanded our direct sales force in emea and opened new offices in the uk and germany 
we have also increased our marketing department staffing as we concentrate on improving the active power brand  and supporting our direct selling activities 
the expense also includes approximately  of stock based compensation 
general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expense from to was primarily attributable to million of stock based compensation expense that we began recording in  and from  of higher legal fees in connection with the greenwich litigation 
these increases were offset by a decrease in the change in our allowance for doubtful accounts expense of million compared to  and lower salaries due to lower headcount 
litigation settlement expense in november we reached a settlement of the litigation with greenwich insurance company whereby greenwich agreed to pay us million in exchange for a full settlement of this case 
accordingly  after million was paid to our former chairman and ceo  pursuant to the reimbursement agreement  we received gross proceeds of million 

table of contents interest income the decrease in interest income from to is primarily attributable to the decrease in the amount of available funds that the company had for investment as our operating losses decreased our cash reserves 
we also altered our investment strategy to move more investments into short term instruments rather than longer term investments  to take advantage of the rising interest rate environment 
income tax expense due to operating losses  we have not recorded any income tax expenses  other than minimum or statutory costs 
as of december   our accumulated net operating loss carryforward was million and our research and development credit carryforwards were million 
we anticipate that these loss carryforward amounts may offset future taxable income that we may achieve and future tax liabilities  however  because of uncertainty regarding our ability to use these carryforwards and the potential limitations due to ownership changes  we have established a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets 
change in market value of additional investment rights in february  we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock to certain accredited investors at a price of per share  resulting in aggregate proceeds of million 
in connection with this offering  we offered these investors additional investor rights to purchase a further  shares of common stock at the price for a limited period of time 
in accordance with the requirements of fas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  we established the fair value of the additional investment rights at the time of the offering based on the proceeds of the offering and the relative fair values of the securities and the additional investment rights 
we used the black scholes valuation model to determine the fair value of the additional investment rights  and accordingly  attributed a value of  to the additional investment rights which was recorded as paid in capital 
changes in the value of the additional investment rights subsequent to the date of issuance due to fluctuations in the market value of our common stock were required to be reflected in our earnings and we revalued these rights at each reporting date 
the additional investment rights expired unexercised in the third quarter of  and as a result  we recorded a gain of  to our earnings 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and investments at december  totaled million 
we have primarily funded our operations through public and private placements of our common stock as well as million in development funding received from caterpillar since  and from our product  service and spares revenue 
in august  we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock to certain accredited institutional investors at a price of per share  for an aggregate offering of million before expenses 
we paid approximately  in commissions to our exclusive placement agent  rbc capital markets in connection with this transaction 
we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission in september to register the underlying shares offered in the private placement  and this was declared effective on october  further  during the third quarter of  we entered into a secured revolving line of credit facility of up to million  subject to a borrowing base formula  with silicon valley bank svb  to help fund our working capital requirements and to provide additional liquidity 
there were no amounts outstanding under this facility at december  
table of contents revolving loans under this credit facility may be borrowed  repaid and re borrowed until october   at which time all amounts borrowed must be repaid and all outstanding letters of credit must be cash collateralized 
revolving loans bear interest at a floating per annum rate equal to svb s prime rate plus 
a default interest rate shall apply during an event of default at a rate per annum equal to above the otherwise applicable interest rate 
the revolving loans are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets  provided that such security interest is limited to no more than of the outstanding capital stock held by us of each of our subsidiaries 
included within our short term investments at december  are aaa aa a rated investments in auction rate securities 
auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments whose interest rates are reset approximately every to days 
the underlying securities generally have longer dated contractual maturities 
the auction rate securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at estimated fair value 
typically  the carrying value of auction rate securities approximates estimated fair value due to the frequent resetting of the interest rates 
at december   we held million of auction rate securities that were included in our short term investments 
these investments were recorded at their fair market value and represented of our total short term investments 
at december   we did not report any unrealized gains or losses related to these securities as we have historically reported the fair market value of these investments at par since that is the value we received when trading them in the established market 
any difference between par value and the purchase price or settlement value have historically been comprised of accrued interest 
all of the auction rate securities were held in taxable municipal bonds 
in accordance with our investment policy and guidelines  our short term investments are diversified among and limited to high quality securities with a minimum of investment grade ratings 
we actively monitor our investment portfolio to ensure compliance with our investment objective to preserve capital  meet liquidity requirements and maximize return on our investments 
we do not require collateral or enter into master netting arrangements to mitigate our credit risk 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
any difficulties in the auction rate securities marketplace may impact the potential liquidity of these investments 
while the underlying credit risk would be unchanged  this may impact our ability to liquidate our investments 
subsequent to year end  we have redeemed million of our auction rate securities 
significant uses of cash operating activities the following table summarizes the yearly changes in cash used in operating activities year annual amount change from prior year percent change cash used in operating activities in decreased by compared to this is primarily attributable to lower operating losses  non cash impairment charges expensed in  lower levels of stock based compensation  and better working capital management as reflected in a decrease in outstanding accounts receivable  and higher deferred revenue from maintenance contracts and customer deposits 
these were partially offset by decreases in accounts payable as we paid for the expenses of our historical stock option review and higher inventory levels 
we anticipate cash used in operating activities for the to continue to decrease from as we anticipate further increases in revenues and reductions in operating losses  which will be partially offset as we reach settlement of the income tax liabilities related to the option investigation  and as a result of an expected increase in receivables due to anticipated higher revenues 

table of contents we used million of cash in funding our operating activities during  which was  or  higher than the million that we consumed in the benefits of the litigation proceeds of million were primarily offset by higher amounts of cash used in working capital  with our inventory and receivables increasing by million compared to the prior year 
the increase in inventories was due to the initial investments we made in sourcing inventory for the coolair product family  and from holding higher levels of finished goods to support our higher revenue levels 
collectively our inventories increased by million from receivables have increased in line with higher quarterly revenues  and increased by million or from this compares to the growth in fourth quarter revenues of from fourth quarter revenues of these increases in inventory and receivables have been reduced by and partially financed by somewhat higher trade payables and accrued liabilities 
investing activities investing activities primarily consist of sales and purchases of investments and purchases of property and equipment 
fluctuations in the sale and purchase of investments generally reflect our use of these funds to finance our ongoing operations 
capital expenditures were  in  compared to million in the this decrease was primarily due to lower investments in in opening foreign sales offices and demonstration centers 
cash provided from investing activities was million in compared to cash used in investing activities of million in this difference is largely due to the timing of purchases and sales of short and long term investments that we hold  and that we redeem periodically to finance our operations 
our purchases of property and equipment increased to million in from million in this increase was due to the investments that we are making in infrastructure as we expand our direct sales presence  and provide demonstration equipment and showrooms in foreign locations  and from investments made to facilitate the development of paralleled megawatt class ups products and new variations of our megawatt class products 
financing activities funds provided by financing activities during were million compared to million for the corresponding period in the significant increase in funds from financing activities compared to the comparable period of is due to the million net proceeds from the private placement that we completed during the third quarter  offset by lower proceeds from option exercises in cash provided from financing activities was million in compared to million in the proceeds in were primarily from the exercise of employee stock options and proceeds from our discontinued employee stock purchase program 
in we received million net proceeds from the private placement of shares of common stock 
contractual commitments in our day to day operations  we incur commitments to make future payments for goods and services 
these arise from entering into operating leases and as we make commitments to vendors to provide us materials and services 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commitments at december  in thousands and thereafter operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations our principal lease commitments consist of our lease for our corporate headquarters and engineering facilities and our global sales offices 

table of contents we have entered into a secured revolving line of credit facility of up to million  subject to a borrowing base formula  with svb 
there were no amounts outstanding under this facility at december  future uses of cash we believe that our cash and investments on hand will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
we expect the level of capital investments to remain similar in to those in we still have outstanding liabilities for professional fees and tax obligations from this investigation that we expensed in but that will be paid in and we expect those payments to not exceed beyond the next twelve months  our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  the market acceptance of our products  the gross profit we are able to generate with our sales  the timing and level of development funding  the rate of expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the rate of expansion of our manufacturing processes  and the timing and extent of research and development projects 
although we are not a party to any agreement or letter of intent with respect to a potential acquisition or merger  we may enter into acquisitions or strategic arrangements in the future  which could also require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
other factors that may affect liquidity as noted above  we believe our existing cash and investments balances at december  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements through at least the next months 
beyond the next months  our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of sales growth  the success of our direct selling strategy  the continued market acceptance of our products  including the coolair dc product family  the timing and level of development funding  the rate of expansion of our sales and marketing activities  the efficiency of our manufacturing processes  and the timing and extent of research and development projects 
should additional funding be required  we may need to raise the required funds through borrowings or public or private sales of debt or equity securities 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt or equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders could be significantly diluted 
if we obtain additional debt financing  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow may be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on such indebtedness  and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations 
we do not know whether we will be able to secure additional funding  or funding on terms acceptable to us  to continue our operations as planned 
if financing is not available  we may be required to reduce  delay or eliminate certain activities or to license or sell to others some of our proprietary technology 
off balance sheet arrangements during the years ended december   and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes

r revised  business combinations  or sfas r  which establishes the acquisition method to account for business combinations 
sfas r requires the acquiring entity to recognize all of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits  and taxable variable rate and fixed rate obligations of corporations  municipalities  and local  state and national government entities and agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
we believe that our investment policy is conservative  both in terms of the average maturity of investments that we allow and in terms of the credit quality of the investments we hold 
we estimate that a decrease in market interest rates would decrease our annual interest income by  because of the nature of the majority of our investments  we do not believe a decline in interest rates would have a material effect on their fair value 
our international sales have historically been made in us dollars 
as the company increases sales in foreign markets  it is making more sales that are denominated in other currencies  primarily euro and british pounds 
those sales in currencies other than us dollars can result in translation gains and losses which have been minimal to date 
currently  we do not engage in hedging activities for our international operations other than an increasing amount of sales and support expenses being incurred in foreign currencies 
however  we may engage in hedging activities in the future 
our international business is subject to the typical risks of any international business  including  but not limited to  the risks described in item a  risk factors 
accordingly  our future results could be materially harmed by the actual occurrence of any of these or other risks
