item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic products for diseases such as diabetes and cancer 
our lead investigational product candidate  the technosphere insulin system  is currently in phase clinical trials in the united states  europe and latin america to study its safety and efficacy in the treatment of diabetes 
this dry powder therapy consists of our proprietary technosphere particles onto which insulin molecules are loaded 
these loaded particles are then aerosolized and inhaled into the deep lung using our proprietary medtone inhaler 
we believe that the performance characteristics  unique kinetics  convenience and ease of use of the technosphere insulin system may have the potential to change the way diabetes is treated 
currently  we are conducting clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of another technosphere based product for the treatment of diabetes and are developing additional formulations of active compounds loaded onto technosphere particles 
we are also developing therapies for the treatment of different types of cancer 
our other product candidates are at the research stage or in pre clinical development 
we are a development stage enterprise and have incurred significant losses since our inception in as of december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of billion 
to date  we have not generated any product revenues and have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities 
we do not expect to record sales of any product prior to regulatory approval and commercialization of our technosphere insulin system 
we currently do not have the required approvals to market any of our product candidates  and we may not receive such approvals 
we may not be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates 
we expect to make substantial and increasing expenditures and to incur additional operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue the clinical development of our technosphere insulin system for the treatment of diabetes  expand our manufacturing operations for our technosphere insulin system to meet our currently anticipated commercial production needs  expand our other research  discovery and development programs  expand our proprietary technosphere platform technology and develop additional applications for the pulmonary delivery of other drugs  and enter into sales and marketing collaborations with other companies  if available on commercially reasonable terms  or develop these capabilities ourselves 

table of contents our business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to the risks inherent in our ongoing clinical trials and the regulatory approval process  the results of our research and development efforts  competition from other products and technologies and uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patent rights 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist mainly of costs associated with the clinical trials of our product candidates that have not yet received regulatory approval for marketing and for which no alternative future use has been identified 
this includes the salaries  benefits and stock based compensation of research and development personnel  laboratory supplies and materials  facility costs  costs for consultants and related contract research  licensing fees  and depreciation of laboratory equipment 
we track research and development costs by the type of cost incurred 
we partially offset research and development expenses with the recognition of estimated amounts receivable from the state of connecticut pursuant to a program under which we can exchange qualified research and development income tax credits for cash 
our research and development staff conducts our internal research and development activities  which include research  product development  clinical development  manufacturing and related activities 
this staff is located in our facilities in valencia  california  paramus  new jersey  and danbury  connecticut 
we expense the majority of research and development costs as we incur them 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we are focused primarily on advancing the technosphere insulin system through phase clinical trials and regulatory filings 
based on the results of preclinical studies  we plan to develop additional applications of our technosphere technology 
additionally  we anticipate that we will continue to determine which research and development projects to pursue  and how much funding to direct to each project  on an ongoing basis  in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate 
we cannot be certain when any revenues from the commercialization of our products will commence 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product candidates other than the technosphere insulin system  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs that we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization 
the costs required to complete the development of our technosphere insulin system will be largely dependent on the scope of our clinical trials  the cost and efficiency of our manufacturing process and discussions with the fda on its requirements 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and stock based compensation for administrative  finance  business development  human resources  legal and information systems support personnel 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include professional service fees and business insurance costs 
critical accounting policies we have based our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates of expenses such as stock option expenses and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies that are critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in more detail below 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets assessing long lived assets for impairment requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets  a determination that the carrying value of such assets cannot be recovered through undiscounted cash flows  loss of legal ownership or title to the assets  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we believe our assets to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
any write downs would be treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the asset and an operating loss would be recognized 
in addition  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the useful lives of the assets 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  our reported results could materially change 
to date  we have had recurring operating losses  and the recoverability of our long lived assets is contingent upon executing our business plan 
if we are unable to execute our business plan  we may be required to write down the value of our long lived assets in future periods 
clinical trial expenses our clinical trial accrual process seeks to account for expenses resulting from our obligations under contract with vendors  consultants  and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts 
our objective is to reflect the appropriate trial expenses in our financial statements by matching period expenses with period services and efforts expended 
we account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial 
we determine accrual estimates through discussions with internal clinical personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials  or the services completed 
service provider status is then compared to the contractual obligated fee to be paid for such services 
during the course of a clinical trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for a period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of the services are often judgmental 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

prior to january   the company accounted for employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and adopted the disclosure only alternative of sfas no 
sfas no 
r eliminated the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options which the company followed until december  further  sfas no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options and the compensatory elements of employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the income statement based upon the fair value of the awards at the grant date 

table of contents upon adoption of sfas no 
r  the company selected the modified prospective transition method whereby unvested awards at the date of adoption  as well as awards that are granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption  will be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
r 
measurement and attribution of compensation cost for awards unvested as of january  is based on the same estimate of the grant date or modification date fair value and the same attribution method straight line used previously under sfas no 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december  and reflect the impact of sfas no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
accounting for income taxes we must make significant management judgments when determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we have established a valuation allowance of million against all of our net deferred tax asset balance  due to uncertainties related to our deferred tax assets as a result of our history of operating losses 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
we are subject to the provisions of fin as of january  we believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our financial position 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to fin the cumulative effect  if any  of applying fin is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
our adoption of fin did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings 
tax years since remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues during the years ended december  and  the company recognized  and  respectively  in revenue under a license agreement 
we do not anticipate sales of any product prior to regulatory approval and commercialization of our technosphere insulin system 
research and development expenses the following table provides a comparison of the research and development expense categories for the years ended december  and dollars in thousands year ended december  change change clinical manufacturing research research and development tax credit stock based compensation expense research and development expenses 
table of contents the increase in research and development expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to increases in manufacturing costs  including clinical supplies  for technosphere insulin and increased costs associated with the expanded clinical development of our technosphere insulin system and the continuation of other preclinical studies 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses will increase slightly in as we complete our pivotal technosphere insulin trials  continue preparation for commercial scale manufacturing of technosphere insulin  expand our technosphere platform technology  and continue to pursue cancer therapies 
specifically  we anticipate increased expenses related to the expansion  qualification and validation of our commercial manufacturing processes and facilities 
the research and development tax credit recognized for the years ended december  and partially offsets our research and development expenses 
the state of connecticut provides an opportunity to exchange certain research and development income tax credit carryforwards for cash in exchange for forgoing the carryforward of the research and development credits 
estimated amounts receivable under the program are recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses

we expect general and administrative expenses to increase slightly in as a result of increased salary related expenses and professional service fees 
interest income and expense interest income for the year ended december  increased million as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to higher cash balances resulting from the sale by the company of common stock and convertible notes in december interest expense for the year ended december  was related to the convertible notes issued in december and amortization of the debt issuance costs  partially offset by capitalized interest related to construction in progress 
interest expense for the year ended december  was related to amounts borrowed under the loan arrangement with our principal stockholder in august years ended december  and revenues during the year ended december   the company recognized  in revenue under a license agreement

the increase in stock based compensation expense was due to the adoption of sfas r on january  as compared to the stock based compensation benefit in that resulted from the fluctuation of our stock price on stock options that were repriced in november liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities 
in october  we issued and sold a total of  shares of our common stock 
of this total   shares were sold to our principal stockholder at a price per share of and  shares were sold to other investors at a price per share of 
the resulting aggregate net proceeds were approximately million after expenses 
in december  
table of contents we issued and sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share in an underwritten public offering 
the resulting aggregate net proceeds to us from this common stock offering were approximately million after expenses 
in december  we also sold million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due the resulting aggregate net proceeds to us from this note offering were approximately million after expenses 
in august  we entered into a million loan arrangement with our principal stockholder  which was amended on august  and replaced with a new loan arrangement on october  under the new loan arrangement  we can borrow up to a total of million before january  from april  until september   we can borrow up to million in one or more advances  and from march  until december   we can borrow the remaining million plus any amount not previously borrowed in one or more advances 
we may not borrow more than one advance in any month period  and each advance must be not less than million 
interest will accrue on each outstanding advance at a fixed rate equal to the one year libor rate as reported by the wall street journal on the date of such advance plus per annum and will be payable quarterly in arrears 
principal repayment is due on december  at any time after january   our principal stockholder can require us to prepay up to million in advances that have been outstanding for at least months 
if our principal stockholder exercises this right  we will have until the earlier of days after our principal stockholder provides written notice or december  to prepay such advances 
in the event of a default  all unpaid principal and interest either becomes immediately due and payable or may be accelerated at our principal stockholder s option  and the interest rate will increase to the one year libor rate calculated on the date of the initial advance or in effect on the date of default  whichever is greater  plus per annum 
any borrowings under the loan arrangement will be unsecured 
the loan arrangement contains no financial covenants 
there are no warrants associated with the loan arrangement  nor are advances convertible into our common stock 
during the year ended december   we used million of cash for our operations compared to using million for our operations in the year ended december  we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   of which million consisted of non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  and other stock based charges pursuant to a research agreement 
we expect our negative operating cash flow to continue at least until we obtain regulatory approval and achieve commercialization of our technosphere insulin system 
we generated million of cash for investing activities during the year ended december   compared to using million for the year ended december  cash provided by investing activities was primarily from net sales of marketable securities of million partially offset by million in machinery and equipment purchases used to expand our manufacturing operations and quality systems in support of our expansion of clinical trials for technosphere insulin system 
we expect to make significant purchases of equipment in the foreseeable future 
our financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december  compared to million for cash from financing activities in was primarily from the equity offering in october and the exercise of stock options throughout the year 
for  cash from financing activities was primarily from the equity and convertible note offerings in december  as well as the exercise of stock options 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
although we believe our existing cash resources  including the expanded million loan arrangement with our principal stockholder  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements through the fourth quarter of  we will require significant additional financing in the future to fund our operations 
accordingly  we expect that we will need to raise additional capital  either through the sale of equity and or debt securities  a strategic business collaboration with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company or the establishment of other funding facilities  in order to continue the development and commercialization of our technosphere insulin system and other product candidates and to support our other ongoing activities 
we intend to use our capital resources to continue the development of our technosphere insulin system and to develop additional applications for our proprietary technosphere platform technology 
in addition  portions of our capital resources will be devoted to expanding our other product development programs for the treatment of different types of cancers 
we are expending a portion of our capital to scale up our manufacturing capabilities in 
table of contents our danbury facilities 
we also intend to use our capital resources for general corporate purposes  which may include in licensing or acquiring additional technologies 
we have held extensive discussions with a number of pharmaceutical companies concerning a potential strategic business collaboration for our technosphere insulin system 
to date  we have not reached agreement with any of these companies on a collaboration 
while we are continuing to engage in such discussions  we believe that we will have to expend significant additional time and effort before we could reach agreement  and we cannot predict when  if ever  we could conclude such an agreement with a partner 
there can be no assurance that any such collaboration will be available to us on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we enter into a strategic business collaboration with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company  we would expect  as part of the transaction  to receive additional capital 
in addition  we expect to pursue the sale of equity and or debt securities  or the establishment of other funding facilities 
issuances of debt or additional equity could impact the rights of our existing stockholders  dilute the ownership percentages of our existing stockholders and may impose restrictions on our operations 
these restrictions could include limitations on additional borrowing  specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens  pay dividends  redeem our stock or make investments 
we also may seek to raise additional capital by pursuing opportunities for the licensing  sale or divestiture of certain intellectual property and other assets  including our technosphere technology platform 
there can be no assurance  however  that any strategic collaboration  sale of securities or sale or license of assets will be available to us on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  we may be required to enter into agreements with third parties to develop or commercialize products or technologies that we otherwise would have sought to develop independently  and any such agreements may not be on terms as commercially favorable to us 
however  we cannot provide assurances that our plans will not change or that changed circumstances will not result in the depletion of our capital resources more rapidly than we currently anticipate 
if planned operating results are not achieved or we are not successful in raising additional equity financing or entering a business collaboration  we may be required to reduce expenses through the delay  reduction or curtailment of our projects  including our technosphere insulin system development activities  or further reduction of costs for facilities and administration 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
commitments and contingencies our contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments 
accordingly  the table below excludes contractual obligations relating to milestone and royalty payments due to third parties  all of which are contingent upon certain future events 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information 
future payments relate to operating lease obligations including facility leases executed in march and november  the senior convertible notes  and open purchase order and supply commitments consisted of the following at december  in thousands payments due in less than more than contractual obligations one year years years years total open purchase order and supply commitments senior convertible note obligations operating lease obligations total contractual obligations the amounts included in open purchase order and supply commitments are subject to performance under the purchase order or contract by the supplier of the goods or services and do not become our obligation until such 
table of contents performance is rendered 
the amount shown is principally for the purchase of materials for our clinical trials  the acquisition of manufacturing equipment  and commitments related to the expansion of our manufacturing plant and the purchase of raw materials under long term supply agreements 
the senior convertible note obligation amounts include future interest payments at a fixed rate of and payment of the notes in full upon maturity in related party transactions for a description of our related party transactions see note related party transactions in the notes to our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb ratified the eitf consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements  that discusses how parties to a collaborative arrangement which does not establish a legal entity within such arrangement should account for various activities 
the consensus indicates that costs incurred and revenues generated from transactions with third parties ie parties outside of the collaborative arrangement should be reported by the collaborators on the respective line items in their income statements pursuant to eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  additionally  the consensus provides that income statement characterization of payments between the participants in a collaborative arrangement should be based upon existing authoritative pronouncements  analogy to such pronouncements if not within their scope  or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
eitf issue no

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not used derivative financial instruments in the past to hedge market risk 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates impacting our cash investment portfolio as well as the interest rate on our credit facility 
the interest rate on our credit facility is a fixed rate equal to the one year libor rate as reported by the wall street journal on the date of such advance plus per annum 
our current policy requires us to maintain a highly liquid short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market funds and investment grade corporate  government and municipal debt 
none of these investments is entered into for trading purposes 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
we do not have any short term investments at december  if we were to draw the available amount on our million credit facility and interest rates were to increase from levels at december  we could experience a higher level of interest expense than assumed in our current operating plan
