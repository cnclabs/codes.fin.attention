item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period 
we use the terms gtsi  we  our  and us to refer to gtsi corp 
and its subsidiaries 
overview gtsi has nearly years of experience in selling it products and solutions primarily to us federal  state and local governments and to prime contractors who are working directly on government contracts 
we believe our key differentiators to be our strong brand among government customers  extensive contract portfolio  close relationships with wide variety of vendors  and a technology lifecycle management approach 
the it solutions we offer to our customers have a strong product component  along with a services component on many solutions 
we connect it s leading vendors  products and services inside the core technology areas most critical to government success by partnering with global it leaders such as sun  cisco  microsoft  hewlett packard  panasonic and network appliance 
gtsi has strong strategic relationships with hardware and software industry leading oems and includes these products in the solutions provided to our customers 
in  we accelerated our realignment around solutions providing us with the greatest opportunity for sustained return on investment 
we directed our attention to government solutions  including unified communications  network security  mobile evidence capture  storage consolidation  and server consolidation 
to help our customers acquire  manage and refresh this technology in a strategic and application appropriate manner  gtsi has created a mix of professional and financial services capable of managing and funding the entire technology lifecycle 
gtsi has grown the professional services organization to handle the increase in engineering  maintenance  and management services supporting our solutions 
additionally  gtsi offers leasing arrangements to allow government agencies to acquire access to technology as an evenly distributed operating expense  rather than the much more budget sensitive and discontinuous capital expenses 
this model is in high demand from our customers  and we believe it represents a distinctive advantage 
as discussed in more detail below our sales decreased approximately million  or  from to  gross margin decreased million however gross margin as a percentage of sales increased percentage points from to  in  we recognized a million extinguishment of a liability  in accordance with fas  and changes in estimates related to vendor payable amounts and vendor rebates of million and million  respectively 
these adjustments positively impacted gross margin and net loss by million  expenses were impacted by approximately million of consulting fees which we do not anticipate in  expenses were impacted by approximately million of one time charges related to refinancing our debt included in interest and other income  and severance and restatement fees included in selling  general administrative expenses  our net loss for the year ended december  was million  cash provided by operations totaled million for the year ended december   
table of contents our business experiences significant fluctuations in our quarterly sales  operating loss income and net loss income as a result of the buying patterns of the federal government  our primary customer 
additionally  our results were positively affected by the derecognition of million in aged accrued payables 
we recorded this legal release from these vendor obligations as an offset to cost of sales  which increased our gross margin by million and decreased our loss from operations and net loss by million  or a decrease of per share 
our results were also positively affected by a change in estimate of vendor rebates of million and a change in estimate of vendor payable amounts of million 
as a result of these items  loss from operations and net loss were million or per share lower and gross margin as a percentage of sales increased percentage points for the year ended december  for additional details  see the further md a discussion below  and refer to note of the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
we continue to evolve as a provider of value added infrastructure solutions that include both products and services to our government and system integrator customers 
we are continually identifying and eliminating certain redundancies within the company and have terminated activities which have failed to yield adequate profitability  including in a reduction in workforce totaling over full time positions and realigning functions throughout the company to increase margin improvement through cost reductions 
in  we have been successful in providing technical assistance to support complex  multi vendor solutions and in priming as well as subcontracting with other service providers 
while the larger infrastructure solutions sales transactions represent a small percentage of our total transactions  they represent the majority of our margin and profits 
going forward  we will continue to focus on these larger  more profitable transactions  and drive processes and changes to make the delivery of the smaller transactions more profitable 
in addition  we will continue to take other action to create and maintain a profitable company 
critical accounting estimates and policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have included below our policies that are both important to our financial condition and operating results  and require management s most subjective and complex judgments in determining the underlying estimates and assumptions 
the following list of critical accounting estimates and policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
accounting policies and estimates that management believes are most important to our financial condition and require management s significant judgments and estimates pertain to revenue recognition  transfer of receivables  valuation of inventory  capitalized internal use software  accounts payable and income taxes 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting estimates and policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the majority of our sales relates to physical products and is generally recognized when title and risk of loss to the products sold passes to the customer 
based on our standard shipping terms  title generally passes upon the customer s receipt of the products 
this requires us to analyze sales near the end of reporting periods to estimate the amount of products in transit to the customer that cannot be recognized as revenue 
many of our sales of physical products are shipped to our customers directly from our vendor partners 
the accurate recording of revenue for these transactions relies upon the accuracy of shipment dates we receive from our vendors and is subject to additional estimates and judgments by management 
when a customer order contains multiple items such as hardware  software  and services that are delivered at varying times  significant judgment is required to determine whether the delivered items can be considered separate units of accounting and if so  how the price should be allocated among the deliverable elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
we also offer lease and other financing arrangements to customers to acquire technology 
these arrangements typically have terms from two to four years and are generally accounted for as sales type leases under financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for leases  fas 
certain of our service and solution agreements require the evaluation of pattern of performance 
revenues on professional service contracts are generally recognized using the proportional performance basis of accounting 
for some professional services engagements the completed performance method is used when there are customer specified subjective acceptance criteria 

table of contents at the time of sale  we record an estimate for product returns based on historical experience 
management reviews the assumptions regarding the lag time and volume of sales returns at least on a quarterly basis  and changes in the estimates are recorded in the period in which they occur 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  we record vendor rebates received under our vendor incentive programs pursuant to a binding arrangement as a reduction of cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation that results in progress by the company toward earning the rebate provided the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
if the rebate is not probable and reasonably estimable  it is recognized as the milestones are achieved 
in the first quarter of  we determined that rebates under one vendor program were both probable and reasonably estimable and thus began to record rebates under this program as purchases occured during each program period 
accrued vendor rebates recorded at december  related to this vendor positively impacted gross margin by million 
financing receivables we enter into complex agreements with our customers to provide it solutions with payment terms generally spread over a two to four year period 
usually we monetize these future revenue streams by selling such receivables to third party financial institutions 
we have master service agreements with multiple lenders each with varying terms 
these agreements  as well as the individual transaction agreements  require significant analysis to determine whether the transfer of the receivable should be accounted for as a sale or a secured borrowing with pledge of collateral based on financial accounting standards board fasb statement of accounting standards fas no 
 accounting for transfer servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  fas criteria that requires gtsi to effectively surrender control over the asset 
the technical accounting and legal requirements involved are complex and subject to interpretation 
significant judgment is required to determine whether we have effectively surrendered control over the asset 
if certain criteria are met and control is surrendered  the transaction is recorded as financing revenue and associated expenses as cost of sales 
if the transfer does not meet the criteria for a sale  the transaction is reported as a secured borrowing with pledge of collateral 
the collateral remains on our balance sheet and revenues and cost of sales are recognized over the term of the agreement 
differing conclusions in these statements could impact total assets  total liabilities  interest expense and earnings loss per share on our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted fas no 
revised  share based payment  fas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payments on estimated fair values 
we adopted this standard using the modified prospective transition method 
prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
during the year ended december   our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of unvested stock options with an exercise price higher than  the market value on the date of the acceleration  previously awarded to employees  officers and directors under gtsi s stock option plans 
this action affected unvested options to purchase an aggregate of thousand shares of common stock at exercise prices per share between and 
the vesting of these options was accelerated to avoid recognizing compensation expense in future financial statements upon the adoption of fas r 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock based awards  which consisted of unrecognized compensation of million related to stock options  million related to restricted stock awards  and million related to sars 
the cost for unrecognized compensation related to stock options  restricted stock awards  and sars is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years  years  and years  respectively 
inventory our inventory is stated at the lower of average cost or market value 
we reduce the value of our inventory for excess and obsolete inventory based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory 
in the future  if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we would be required to increase our expense to write down inventory to market value and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
capitalized internal use software significant judgment is required to determine what expenditures qualify for capitalization of internal use software 
subsequent additions  modifications or upgrades to internal use software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task that it previously did not perform 
capitalized internal use software is required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair market value 

table of contents accounts payable we purchase significant amounts of inventory each year and record an estimate of the payable based on purchases as of the balance sheet date and the historic rate of purchase price variances  which is analyzed and adjusted on a quarterly basis 
for products shipped directly from our vendors to our customers  management makes significant estimates regarding the payable for shipped goods 
as invoices are received  we record adjustments for purchase price variances 
changes in our estimate of the payable balance may be caused by changes in price between the order date and the receipt date related to volume discounts  changes in market rates  or special pricing promotions offered by our vendors 
bids and proposals in accordance to staff accounting bulletin reference to fsb technical bulletin no 
 we amortize costs that are directly related to the acquisition of a long term contract and that would have not been incurred but for the acquisition of that contract incremental direct acquisition costs 
as long term contracts are awarded the related up front incentive costs  which are specific incremental costs associated with the acquisition of long term contracts  are recorded as prepaid deferred assets and amortized over the term of the contract or five years  whichever is shorter 
income taxes determining our effective tax rate  provision for tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the related valuation allowance involves judgments and estimates 
deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the basis reported in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse 
valuation allowances are provided against assets  including net operating losses  if it is anticipated that the asset is not more likely than not to be realized through future taxable earnings or implementation of tax planning strategies 
we record reserves for uncertain tax positions  which management believes are adequate 
we have a valuation allowance against the full amount of our net deferred tax assets  because in the opinion of management  it is not more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized 
our effective tax rate in a given period could be impacted if we determine the allowance is or is not required  or if we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves
