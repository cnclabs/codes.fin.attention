item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere this annual report on form k 
overview we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs  markets and sells mixed signal integrated circuits for multiple video applications in the security surveillance  automotive  consumer and pc markets 
we target video applications based on digital technologies that receive and process analog video signals 
these video applications include security surveillance systems  in car lcd displays  advanced tvs  multifunction lcd monitors  camcorders  dvd recorders and tv tuner cards 
these applications receive analog video signals commonly generated by surveillance cameras  by consumer electronics devices such as set top boxes  dvd players  vcrs and camcorders  and to a lesser extent by over the air tv broadcasts 
we design application specific products that enable the conversion of analog video sources to digital form and perform advanced digital video processing to facilitate the display  storage and transport of video content 
we believe this product strategy allows us to better address varying customer requirements  fully leverage our technology capabilities and achieve greater share within our target markets 
our semiconductors are based on our proprietary architecture and mixed signal technologies that we believe provide high video quality under a wide range of signal conditions  enable high levels of integration and are cost effective 
we commenced operations in from to  we were primarily involved in developing our technology 
we shipped our first generation video decoder in since  our business has experienced significant growth primarily as a result of our ability to develop new products  obtain design wins and convert these design wins into revenues 
we generated revenues from the sale of over different products in the year ending december  we have three principal semiconductor product lines security surveillance products  liquid crystal display  or lcd  products  and video decoder products 
our security surveillance products integrate important functions required to display  store and transport analog video signals from security surveillance cameras 
for example  we integrate multiple video decoders into a single semiconductor 
as a result  this semiconductor is able to receive and decode analog video signal from multiple cameras into a standard digital format 
in addition  we integrate a multiplexer  a key technology required to combine multiple video signals into a single video signal 
in  we introduced our most integrated security surveillance product  which includes four video decoders and a system controller and a multiplexer on a single semiconductor 
we also have developed a motion jpeg  or mjpeg  encoder decoder  or codec  that facilitates the storage and playback of video from a hard disk drive and transport of video over the internet 
we currently sell our security surveillance products to customers for the following applications embedded digital video recorders  or dvrs  pc based dvrs  network video recorders  or nvrs and multiplexers 
our lcd display products integrate important functions required to display analog tv broadcast  popular analog video  high definition video and pc graphics signals on an lcd display 
we have targeted our initial products for applications in the in the automotive markets 
our first products in this market provided customers with an integrated video decoder and lcd display processor for lcd display panels in vehicles that provided rear seat entertainment 
in the first quarter of  we introduced five new lcd display processors that can be used in navigation systems for front seat consoles in the automotive market 
these new products are designed to provide advanced image processing  an integrated programmable timing controller and multiple analog and digital video inputs 
our video decoder products are high performance mixed signal semiconductors that decode analog tv broadcast signals  including national television systems committee  or ntsc  phase alternation line  or pal  and sequential color with memory  or secam  and popular analog video signals  including composite  s video  component and syndicate of radio and television manufacturers  or scart  into a standard digital format 
we intend to develop our video decoder products for targeted applications within the consumer and pc markets 
our other products include early generation mixed signal semiconductors for digital video applications and pci video decoder products  which are video decoders that utilize peripheral component interconnect  or pci  technology for personal computer applications 
although our revenues have grown rapidly in a short period of time  we do not expect to achieve similar growth rates in the future 
we currently expect to increase our expense levels in each of the next several quarters to support increased research and development and sales and marketing efforts 
these expenditures may not result in increased revenue or profitability in the future 
in addition  our ability to increase our revenues will depend on increased demand for digital video applications in the consumer  security surveillance and automotive markets 
the growth of our target markets is uncertain 
in addition  the timing of orders by and shipments to our customers  as well as general trends in our target markets  can cause our revenue growth to be inconsistent 
we undertake significant product development efforts well in advance of a product s release  and in advance of receiving purchase orders from our customers 
our product development efforts  which are focused on developing new designs with broad demand and potential for future derivative products  typically take from six months to two years until production begins  depending on the product s complexity 
if we secure a design win  the system designer is likely to continue to use the same or enhanced versions of our product across a number of their models  which tends to extend the life cycles of our product 
conversely  if a competitor secures the design win  it may be difficult for us to sell into the customer s application for an extended period 
our sales cycle typically ranges from six to months 
due to the length of our product development and sales cycle  the majority of our revenues for any period is generally weighted toward products introduced for sale  meaning products for which we commenced placing orders with our manufacturing subcontractors  in the prior one or two years 
as a result  our present revenues are not necessarily representative of future sales because our future sales are likely to be comprised of a different mix of products  some of which are now in the development stage 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we outsource all of our manufacturing  assembly and test functions to third party vendors primarily located in taiwan 
this business model enables us to reduce our capital expenditures and fixed costs  while focusing our engineering and design resources on our core strength  the design of mixed signal semiconductors for digital video applications 
we sell our products to distributors that fulfill third party orders for our products 
we also sell directly  using independent sales representatives  to oems and to original design manufacturers  or odms 
in  we derived approximately of our revenues from products sold to distributors and from products sold to oems or odms 
in  we derived approximately of our revenues from products sold to distributors and from products sold to oems or odms 
in  we derived of our revenues from products sold to distributors and from products sold to oems or odms 
our gross margins have not historically been significantly different between sales to distributors and sales to oems or odms through orders procured by independent sales representatives 
however  our operating profit on sales through orders procured by independent sales representatives can be less due to the payment of commissions to sales representatives which we record as sales and marketing expense 
we received an aggregate of  and of our revenues from our ten largest customers in  and  respectively 
in  one of our customers  a distributor  accounted for of our revenues 
in  three of our customers  all of which are distributors  accounted for  and of our revenues  respectively 
in  two of our customers  both of which are distributors  each accounted for of our revenues 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from sales to foreign customers  particularly in asia  which sales accounted for approximately of our revenues in both and and approximately of our revenues in the table below indicates the percentage of total revenue by geographic location for the periods indicated year ended december  taiwan south korea china japan other we believe that a substantial majority of our revenues will continue to come from customers located in asia  where most of the consumer electronic devices that use our semiconductors  are manufactured 
as a result of this regional customer concentration  we may be subject to economic  cultural and political events and other developments that impact our customers in asia 
all of our sales currently are denominated in us dollars 
therefore  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
substantially all of our cost of revenues and a majority of our operating expenses are also denominated in us dollars 
as a consequence  we believe that our overall exposure to foreign exchange risk is low 
we have two international subsidiaries  one in japan and one in china 
we also have two international branches  one in south korea and one in taiwan 
at december   of our employees were located in our international subsidiaries and branch offices 
our japan subsidiary is involved in both product development and technical marketing support 
our china subsidiary and our taiwan and korea branches primarily provide marketing support 
it is difficult for us to forecast the demand for our products  in part because of the highly complex supply chain between us and the end markets that incorporate our products 
demand for new features changes rapidly 
distributors and odms add an additional layer of complexity 
we must  therefore  forecast demand not only from our direct customers  but also from other participants in this multi level distribution channel 
because of our lengthy product development cycle  it is critical for us to anticipate changes in demand for our various product features and the applications they serve  to allow sufficient time for product design 
our failure to accurately forecast demand can lead to product shortages that can impede production by our customers and harm our relationship with these customers 
conversely  our failure to forecast declining demand or shifts in product mix can result in excess or obsolete inventory 
generally  the average selling price of our products will decline over the life of the product 
our experience to date is that the decline has not had a material effect on our gross margins  as price reductions have been mitigated by lower per unit costs associated with both high unit volume and the transition of our products to smaller process geometries 
we expect revenues from these products to be lower in the first calendar quarter of the year 
in addition  a significant number of our semiconductors are sold to customers located in asia  primarily to customers located in regions who observe the lunar new year holiday 
typically  our customers are closed for a week or more during the extended holiday period  which negatively impacts our business 
as a result of seasonality associated with the consumer market and our customer concentration in asia  we expect our revenues to lower in the first calendar quarter of each year 
our revenues increased by for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  our income before income taxes decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to increased compensation related expenses  tape out expenses  and expenses associated with the expansion of our foreign offices 
we may not be able to maintain our recent growth and profitability and our limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results very difficult 
we believe that period to period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our condensed consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to inventory valuations  income taxes  warranty obligations and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments we make about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
because these estimates can vary depending on the situation  actual results may differ from the estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment  provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
we do not allow for price protection or stock rotation rights with any of our distributors 
if we change our practice and allow stock rotation or price protection in the future  we would have to evaluate the consequences on the timing of our revenue recognition  which could lead to the deferral of the revenues subject to such uncertainties unless reasonable estimates can be made at the time of shipment 
warranty 
we offer an month product replacement warranty against any defective product 
we accrue for estimated returns of defective products at the time revenue is recognized  based on the rate of return from our historical experience 
as a consequence of standardized manufacturing processes and product testing procedures  returns of defective product are infrequent and the quantities have not been significant 
accordingly  historical warranty costs have not been significant in the fiscal periods presented 
if our future experience with warranty costs differs significantly from our historical experience  we would need to exercise increased judgment in determining the appropriate warranty accrual 
inventory valuation 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market  computed on a first in  first out basis 
we evaluate inventory for excess and obsolescence and write off units that are unlikely to be sold based upon a six months demand forecast 
this evaluation may take into account matters including expected demand  anticipated sales price  product obsolescence and other factors 
if actual future demand for our products is less than currently forecasted  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
once a reserve is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or scrapped 
if a unit that has been written down or off is subsequently sold  the cost associated with the revenue from this unit is reduced to the extent of the write off  resulting in an increase in gross profit 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of statement of financial standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in applying sfas no 
 we are required to estimate our current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
at december   our total deferred tax assets were principally comprised of net operating loss carryforwards  research tax credit carryforwards  stock based compensation expenses  and expense accruals 
as required under the provisions of sfas no 
 we assessed the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from taxable income  we applied the guidance provided in sfas no 
and considered both positive evidence that indicates a valuation allowance is not needed and negative evidence that indicates a valuation allowance is needed 
at september   we considered our recent history of consecutive profitable quarters and anticipated profit in future periods  and we released the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets of approximately million as we believe that it is more likely than not the deferred tax assets will be realized in the future 
we file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  various states and foreign jurisdictions 
we have not been under the examination of us federal  state or other foreign jurisdictions 
on january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 or fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of the implementation of fin no 
 we recognized no material adjustment to the january  balance of retained earnings 
we recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in our income tax expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in our operating expenses 
during the year ended december   we recognized approximately  in interest and no penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  or sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires that we measure compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including employee stock options  based on estimated fair values and recognize that expense over the required service period 
prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for stock based compensation awards issued to our employees using the intrinsic value measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 or apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under apb opinion no 
 compensation cost was recognized based on the difference  if any  on the date of grant between the fair value of our stock and the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the prospective transition method 
under this method  sfas no 
r is applied to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after january  compensation cost previously recorded under apb opinion no 
for unvested options will continue to be recognized as the required services are rendered 
accordingly  for the years ended december  and  stock based compensation expense includes compensation costs related to estimated fair values of awards granted after the date of adoption of sfas no 
r and compensation costs related to unvested awards at the date of adoption based on the intrinsic values as previously recorded under apb opinion no 
for options granted after january   and valued in accordance with sfas no 
r  we use the straight line method for expense attribution 
for options granted prior to january   we use the multiple grant approach for expense attribution  which results in substantially higher amounts of amortization in earlier years as opposed to the straight line method  which results in equal amortization over the vesting period of the options 
the fair value of options granted after january  is estimated on the grant date using the black scholes option valuation model 
since our stock has been actively traded for only a short period of time  we use the simplified calculation of expected term described in staff accounting bulletin no 
and volatility is based on an average of the historical volatilities of the common stock of several entities with characteristics similar to us 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected term of the option 
the estimated forfeiture rate is based on our historical forfeiture experience and is estimated at for all periods presented 
the following assumptions are used to value stock options granted after adoption of sfas no 
r year ended december  expected term in years risk free interest rate expected volatility dividend yield compensation expense for restricted stock awards is determined using the fair value of techwell s stock on the date of the grant and is recognized on a straight line basis over the service period 
stock based compensation expense is allocated among cost of revenues  research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively  based upon the employee s job function 
we expect to continue to recognize substantial amounts of stock based compensation expense relating to our employee stock options in future periods primarily as a result of our adoption of sfas no

consists of our video decoders designed for use in the consumer  security surveillance and automotive markets 
revenues from video decoders used in security surveillance systems and lcd displays are reported under our video decoder product line and not our security surveillance or lcd display product lines 
consists of our application specific products designed for use in lcd displays 
consists of early generation mixed signal semiconductors for digital video applications and pci video decoder products 
comparison of years ended december   and revenues 
our revenues consist of sales of our mixed signal integrated circuits for digital video applications 
we have three principal product lines security surveillance  lcd display and video decoders 
all of our sales are denominated in us dollars 
revenues were million in and million in  an increase of 
revenues from our security surveillance products were million an increase of approximately million  or  in compared to  primarily a result of the increase in sales of our four in one video decoders and our more highly integrated security surveillance products 
revenues from our video decoder products were million  a decrease of approximately million  or  in compared to  primarily as a result of a general decrease in demand from the markets for products utilizing video decoders such as multi function monitors and dvd recorders 
revenues from our lcd display products were million  a decrease of approximately million  or  in compared to  primarily as a result of a decline in production in the automotive market of vehicles installed with in car lcd displays that utilize our product 
other revenues increased slightly in as compared to  primarily as a result of increased sales of our pci video decoder products 
revenues were million in and million in  an increase of primarily from the increased revenues from our security surveillance products that increased approximately million  or  in compared to the increased revenues in security surveillance were primarily a result of the increase in sales of our four in one video decoders and our recently introduced more highly integrated security surveillance products 
revenues from our video decoder products increased approximately million  or  in compared to  primarily as a result of a general increase in demand from the markets for products such as multi function monitors and dvd recorders  offset by a shift in sales from general purpose video decoders to application specific products specifically designed for the security surveillance market 
revenues from our lcd display products increased approximately million  or  in compared to  primarily as a result of a continuing ramp of customer projects begun from earlier design wins in the automotive market 
other revenues decreased million  or  in as compared to  primarily as a result of decreased sales of our pci video decoder products 
gross profit and gross margin 
gross profit is the difference between revenues and cost of revenues  and gross margin represents gross profit as a percentage of revenues 
cost of revenues  also known as cost of goods sold  consists primarily of cost of processed silicon wafers  costs associated with assembly  test and shipping of our production semiconductors  cost of personnel and related expenses associated with supporting our outsourced manufacturing activities and write downs for excess and obsolete inventory 
gross profit was million in  million in  and million in the year over year increase in gross profit was attributable to a higher volume of product sales for each successive year 
gross margin was for  for and for the increase in gross margin in from was favorably impacted by cost savings from reduced materials costs partially attributable to increased volume purchases and the increasing transition of our products to lower process geometries that has occurred throughout the increase in gross margin in from was primarily a result of reduced materials costs and production costs in as compared to partially attributable to increased volume purchases 
we incurred stock based compensation included in cost of revenues associated with outsourced manufacturing support and quality assurance personnel of million in  million in and less than million in research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and associated costs of employees engaged in research and development  contractor costs  tape out costs  development testing and evaluation costs  occupancy costs and depreciation expense 
before releasing new products  we incur charges for mask sets  prototype wafers and mask set revisions  which we refer to as tape out costs 
tape out costs cause our research and development expenses to fluctuate because they are not incurred uniformly every quarter 
we expect our research and development costs to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we increase our investment in developing new products 
research and development expenses were million  or of revenues  in  million  or of revenues  in  million  or of revenues  in the increase in research and development expense in from was primarily attributable to increased compensation expense of million reflecting both increases in stock based compensation and in headcount to support the development of new technologies 
the increase in was also attributable to an increase of approximately million of tape out expenses 
tape out expenses are not incurred uniformly each quarter and that have increased with our migration to smaller geometry process technologies 
the increase in research and development expense in from was primarily attributable to increased compensation expense of million to support the development of new technologies 
the increase in compensation related expenses was partially offset by a decrease of million in tape out expenses for new products in we incurred stock based compensation expense associated with research and development personnel of million in  million in and million in the increase in stock based compensation expenses was a result of the increase in personnel in research and development from to in  stock based compensation expense included million for stock options and awards granted to certain consultants as compensation for product development services 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and associated costs for marketing  selling and administrative personnel  sales commissions to independent sales representatives  contractor compensation  public relations  promotional and other marketing expenses  insurance and fees paid for professional services  travel  depreciation expenses and occupancy costs 
costs associated with audit and tax services  corporate governance and compliance and financial reporting are also selling  general and administrative expenses 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the future in support of our anticipated growth and to cover additional costs associated with operating as a public company  such as improvements to our information technology infrastructure and increased costs associated with our efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of revenues  in  million  or of revenues  in  million  or of revenues  in the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in from was primarily attributable to increases of million in compensation related expenses primarily associated with stock based compensation  million of expenses associated with the expansion of our foreign offices  million in insurance and administrative fees reflecting costs associated with being a public company  million for trade shows and other marketing activities  million in professional services expenses primarily for audit  tax and legal services  and million for depreciation expenses and occupancy costs 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in the future in support of our anticipated growth as we hire additional personnel and expand our sales and marketing efforts 
administrative expenses will also increase to cover additional costs associated with our information technology infrastructure and our efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of the million increase in from was primarily attributable to an increase of million in compensation related expenses associated with the growth in our business  million in professional services expenses primarily for audit  tax and legal services and million in insurance and administrative fees reflecting costs associated with being a public company  and million of expenses associated with the expansion of our foreign offices and our subsidiary in china 
these increases in expenses were offset in part by a decrease of million in in commission expense paid to our outside sales representatives reflecting a larger proportion of sales to distributors in we incurred stock based compensation expense associated with selling  general and administrative personnel of million in  million in and million in the increase in stock based compensation expenses was a result of the increase in personnel in sales from to interest income 
interest income was million in  million in and million in the increase in from was attributable to higher cash  cash equivalent and short and long term investment balances primarily as a result of our income from operations and higher interest rates earned on our cash  cash equivalent and investment balances in as compared to the increase in from was attributable to higher cash  cash equivalent and short and long term investment balances primarily as a result of our initial public offering and higher interest rates in as compared to income taxes 
a benefit from income taxes of million was recorded in a provision for income taxes of million and million were recorded in and  respectively 
in  the effective tax rate differed from the statutory federal income tax rate primarily because we recognized a tax benefit from the release of our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets of approximately million 
the effective tax rate for and differed from the statutory federal income tax rate primarily because we utilized prior net operating losses and available tax credits in years which we had a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we expect our effective tax rate to increase significantly beginning in the first quarter of however  our future effective income tax rate will be subject to many variables  including the absolute amount and future geographic distribution of our pre tax income and our ability to take advantage of tax planning strategies that may be available to us 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our growth primarily with proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock and common stock 
in june  we received approximately million in cash  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and other offering costs  from our initial public offering of common stock 
in july  we received aggregate proceeds of million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions  from the sale of an additional  shares following the underwriters partial exercise of their over allotment option related to our initial public offering 
our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million as of december   million as of december  and million as of december  net cash provided by operating activities was million in the cash provided by our operating activities in the was primarily due to our net income of million and a decrease of accounts receivable of million attributable to the timing of customer collections  as well as non cash charges to stock based compensation expenses of million and depreciation expense of million in we also recognized a tax benefit of million attributable to our equity incentive plans 
these were partially offset by decreases in accrued liabilities of million and accounts payable of million primarily related to compensation costs and payments we have received from our customers in advance of product shipment  an increase in inventory of million in response to increasing customer demand  and a million increase in deferred income taxes  which was non cash as a result of the release of a valuation allowance 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the cash provided by our operating activities in the was primarily due to our net income of million  an increase in accounts payable of million associated with increasing customer demand as a result of new product introductions and increased sales of existing products  an increase in accrued liabilities of million primarily related to compensation costs and payments we have received from our customers in advance of product shipment and a decrease of accounts receivable of million attributable to the timing of customer collections 
these were partially offset by an increase in inventory of million in response to increasing customer demand and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of million reflecting interest earned on our investments but not received  advance payments for insurance expense and excess tax benefits from stock based compensation 
we incurred non cash expenses of million for stock based compensation expense and million in depreciation expense in we also recognized a tax benefit of million attributable to our equity incentive plans 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the cash provided by our operating activities in was primarily due to our net income of million and an increase in accrued liabilities of million and accounts payable of million and prepaid expenses and other current assets of million  which was substantially offset by increases in accounts receivable of million and inventory of million 
the increases in inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable were associated with the increase in revenues during the period as a result of new product introductions and increased sales of existing products 
the increase in accrued liabilities was due to compensation costs associated with our increased headcount and inventory purchases and taxes payable associated with achieving profitability 
we incurred non cash expenses of million for stock based compensation expense and million in depreciation expenses in net cash used in our investing activities was million in reflecting purchases of short and long term investments of million and purchases of capital equipment of million offset by maturities of short investments of million 
net cash used in our investing activities was million in reflecting purchases of short and long term investments of million and purchases of capital equipment of million offset by maturities of short investments of million 
net cash provided by our investing activities was million in due to the maturities of short term investments of million and a million decrease in restricted cash  partially offset by the purchase of capital equipment of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in reflecting proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in reflecting proceeds from our initial stock offering  net of underwriting discounts  commissions and offering costs of million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
net cash provided by our financing activities was million in net cash provided by our financing activities in consisted of proceeds of million from the issuance of series f preferred stock  million from the exercise of common stock options  million from collections of stockholders notes receivable  partially offset by payment of deferred offering costs of million 
at february   we held approximately million of investments  classified as current assets  with an auction reset feature  which are referred to as auction rate securities  whose underlying assets are generally student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
our holdings of auction rate securities decreased from million at december  due to successful sales of several auction rate securities at the carrying value in february in february  auctions failed for our auction rate securities  and there is no assurance that currently successful auctions on the other auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not 
all of our auction rate securities  including those subject to the failure  were rated aaa at the time of purchase  the highest rating  by a rating agency 
if the issuers of these securities are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we believe that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing our auction rate securities have not been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these investments 
we are continuing to evaluate the credit quality  classification and valuation of our auction rate securities  however  we are not yet able to quantify the amount of impairment  if any  or change in classification in these investments at this time 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
we believe our existing cash balances  as well as cash expected to be generated from operating activities  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our long term future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our level of revenues  the timing and extent of spending to support our product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of our introductions of new products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  the continuing market acceptance of our products and our ability to liquidate our auction rate securities in a timely manner 
we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of the securities and exchange commission s regulation s k

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objectives of our investment activity are to preserve principal  provide liquidity and maximize income without significantly increasing the risk 
some of the securities we invest in are subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents  short and long term investments in demand accounts  money market funds  commercial paper  corporate bonds  us government agency securities and auction rate securities which are investment grade securities with a maximum dollar weighted maturity of two years or less 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio  and we believe that a change in interest rates would not have a significant impact on our interest income 
at february   we held approximately million of investments  classified as current assets  with an auction reset feature  which are referred to as auction rate securities  whose underlying assets are generally student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
our holdings of auction rate securities decreased from million at december  due to successful sales of several auction rate securities at the carrying value in february in february auctions failed for our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that currently successful auctions on the other auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will continue to succeed and as a result our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not 
all of our auction rate securities  including those subject to the failure  were rated aaa at the time of purchase  the highest rating  by a rating agency 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we believe that the underlying credit quality of the assets backing our auction rate securities have not been impacted by the reduced liquidity of these investments 
we are continuing to evaluate the credit quality  classification and valuation of our auction rate securities  however  we are not yet able to quantify the amount of impairment  if any  or change in classification in these investments at this time 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
to date  our international customer agreements have been denominated solely in us dollars  and accordingly  we have not been exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations from customer agreements  and do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  the functional currency of our operations in taiwan  south korea and china is the us dollar and our local accounts are maintained in the local currency in taiwan  south korea and china  respectively  and thus we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations associated with remeasurement to us dollars 
such fluctuations have not been significant historically and we believe that a change in exchange rates would not have a significant impact on our operating expenses
