item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included in part iv  item of this report and the risk factors section in item a  as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this report  before deciding to purchase  hold or sell our common stock 
overview we are a leader in the traffic management market that focuses on the development and application of advanced technologies that reduce traffic congestion  minimize the environmental impact of traffic congestion and improve the safety of surface transportation systems 
by combining outdoor image processing  traffic engineering and information technology  we offer a broad range of intelligent transportation systems and driver safety solutions to customers worldwide 
we currently operate in three reportable segments roadway sensors  vehicle sensors and transportation systems 
the roadway sensors segment includes our vantage vehicle detection systems for traffic intersection control  incident detection and certain highway traffic data collection applications 
the vehicle sensors segment is comprised of all activities related to our autovue lane departure warning systems for vehicle safety 
the transportation systems segment includes transportation engineering and consulting services and the development of transportation management and traveler information systems for the its industry 
our vantage product is a video vehicle detection system that detects the presence of vehicles on roadways 
vantage systems are used at signalized intersections to enable a traffic controller to more efficiently allocate green signal time and are also used for incident detection and highway traffic data collection applications 
we sell and distribute our vantage products primarily to commercial customers and municipal agencies 
our autovue ldw systems consist of a small windshield mounted sensor that uses proprietary software to detect and warn drivers of unintended lane departures 
in excess of  production autovue units have been sold for car and truck platforms in the north american and european markets 
our autovue ldw systems are currently qualified as an option on certain heavy trucks  including mercedes benz  man  iveco  daf  scania  freightliner and fuso  as well as neoplan and man luxury bus and coach lines 
in north america  our ldw systems are sold primarily to truck fleets  and to date  us heavy truck fleets have selected our ldw systems  representing an estimated  vehicles 
in september  we entered into an agreement with valeo schalter and sensuren gmbh valeo  pursuant to which we granted valeo the exclusive right to sell and manufacture our autovue ldw systems to the worldwide passenger car market in exchange for royalty payments for each autovue ldw unit sold 
to date  royalty payments from valeo have not been significant 
pursuant to this agreement  we also provide specific contract engineering services  technical marketing and sales support to valeo to enable the incorporation of our ldw technology on three infiniti platforms  the fx  m and ex  where the device is offered as part of various option packages 
valeo is currently in discussions to provide our ldw system to other passenger car oems  however  we cannot assure you that such discussions will be successful 
we plan to continue to provide technical marketing and sales support to valeo in our efforts to win new oem customers for the passenger car market as well as contract engineering services related to the possible launch of new infiniti platforms that include our ldw system 
we believe that autovue is a broad sensor platform that  through additional software development  may be expanded to incorporate additional safety and convenience features 
our transportation management systems business includes transportation engineering and consulting services focused on the planning  design  development and implementation of software based systems that integrate sensors  video surveillance  computers and advanced communications equipment to enable public agencies to monitor  control and direct traffic flow  assist in the quick dispatch of emergency crews and distribute real time information about traffic conditions 
our services include planning  design and implementation of surface transportation infrastructure systems 
we perform analysis and study goods movement  commercial vehicle operations  travel demand forecasting and systems engineering  and identify mitigation measures to reduce traffic congestion 
these services and systems are primarily sold to local  state and national transportation agencies in the united states 
our transportation management systems business is largely dependent upon governmental funding and budgetary issues 
the federal highway bill that was passed in august provided for a significant increase in transportation funding over the following six years 
we believe the recent expansion of our transportation management systems business was due in part to the passage of the federal highway bill  combined with increased transportation funds available at state and local agencies throughout the country 
the federal highway bill is set to expire in it is too early to determine any impact on future contract revenues as a result of potential delays in the passage of future bills 
prior to our fiscal year ended march  fiscal  we operated in three segments consisting of its  video products and telecom products 
the its segment consisted of our current operations  which was previously conducted by the iteris subsidiary 
the video products segment included our former wholly owned subsidiary  maxxess systems  inc maxxess  which designed and manufactured security management systems 
our telecom products segment included our wholly owned subsidiary  zyfer  inc zyfer  which developed and manufactured timing and synchronization products 
during fiscal  we completed the divestiture of maxxess and zyfer and restructured our operations to focus on the operations of our iteris subsidiary 
our financial statements for all periods presented in this report have been restated to reflect the discontinuation of the operations of maxxess and zyfer 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements included herein  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to the collectibility of accounts receivable  the valuation of inventories  the recoverability of long lived assets and goodwill  the realizability of deferred tax assets  accounting for stock based compensation  the valuation of equity instruments  warranty reserves and other contingencies 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions by their nature involve risks and uncertainties  and may prove to be inaccurate 
in the event that any of our estimates or assumptions are inaccurate in any material respect  it could have a material adverse effect on our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record product revenues and related costs of sales upon transfer of title  which is generally upon shipment or  if required  upon acceptance by the customer  provided that we believe collectibility of the net sales amount is reasonably assured 
accordingly  at the date revenue is recognized  the significant uncertainties concerning the sale have been resolved 
contract revenues are derived primarily from long term contracts with governmental agencies 
contract revenues include costs incurred plus a portion of estimated fees or profits determined using the percentage of completion method of accounting based on the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated costs 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to earnings when identified 
changes in job performance and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to recognized costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
profit incentives are included in revenue when their realization is reasonably assured 
in addition to product and contract revenues  we derive revenue from technology access fees  the provision of specific non recurring contract engineering services to our strategic partner  valeo  related to our autovue ldw systems  and royalties earned on unit sales of our autovue ldw systems by valeo to the passenger car market 
technology access fee revenues are recognized evenly over the period in which they are earned 
non recurring contract engineering revenues are recognized in the period in which the related services are performed 
royalty revenues are recorded based on unit sales of our products by valeo and are recognized in the period in which such sales occur 
technology access fee revenues  non recurring contract engineering revenues and royalty revenues are included in net sales 
revenues from follow on service and support  for which we generally charge separately  are recorded in the period in which the services are performed 
accounts receivable 
we estimate the collectibility of customer receivables on an ongoing basis by periodically reviewing invoices outstanding greater than a certain period of time 
we record reserves for receivables deemed to be at risk for collection as well as a general reserve based on our historical collections experience 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of trade receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
inventory 
inventories consist of finished goods  work in process and raw materials and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we provide reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventory 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
reserves are established for inventory levels that exceed anticipated future demand 
it is possible that reserves over and above those already established may be required in the future if market conditions for our products deteriorate 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually in our fourth fiscal quarter at the reporting unit level unless a change in circumstances indicates that more frequent impairment analysis is required 
impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the reporting units with the recorded goodwill 
fair value is determined by using the income approach methodology of valuation which utilizes discounted cash flows 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use the financial assumptions in our current budget and our current strategic plan  subject to modification as considered necessary  including sales and expense growth rates and the discount rates we estimate to represent our cost of funds 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of goodwill  we could incur impairment charges 
warranty 
we generally provide a one to three year warranty from the original invoice date on all products  materials and workmanship 
defective products are either repaired or replaced  at our option  upon meeting certain criteria 
we accrue a provision for the estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties relating to a product as a component of cost of sales at the time revenue for that product is recognized 
the accrued warranty provision is included within accrued expenses on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
should our actual experience of warranty returns be higher than anticipated  additional warranty reserves may be required  which may adversely affect our operating results 
income taxes 
we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that we believe are more likely than not to be realized 
realization of deferred tax assets such as net operating loss carryforwards is dependent on future taxable earnings and is therefore uncertain 
on a quarterly basis  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset  increasing our income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
on an interim basis  we estimate what our anticipated annual effective tax rate will be and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with this anticipated rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  we refine our estimates based upon actual events and earnings during the year 
this estimation process can result in significant changes to our expected effective tax rate 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision reflects the expected annual rate 
the changes described in the preceding sentence and adjustments to our valuation allowance may create fluctuations in our overall effective tax rate from quarter to quarter 
effective april   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which applies to all tax positions accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by establishing minimum standards for the recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under the requirements of fin  we must review all of our tax positions and make a determination as to whether our position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by regulatory authorities 
if a tax position meets the more likely than not standard  then the related tax benefit is measured based on a cumulative probability analysis of the amount that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement or disposition of the underlying issue 
stock based compensation 
we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  effective april  prior to april   we followed the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  and  accordingly  accounted for our stock based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations 
sfas r requires all stock based payments  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations as an expense  based on their grant date fair values with such fair values amortized over the requisite service period 
we elected to utilize the modified prospective method for the transition to sfas r 
under the modified prospective method  sfas r applies to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption 
in addition  under the modified prospective method  compensation expense will be recognized for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of april   based on grant date fair values estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas in implementing sfas r  we have used the black scholes merton bsm option pricing formula to estimate the fair value of stock based awards granted subsequent to april  our assumptions under the bsm formula include the following expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our stock price  the expected life of options is derived based on the historical life of our options  and the risk free rate for periods within the expected life of the option is based on the us treasury interest rates in effect at the time of grant 
additionally  sfas did not require the estimation of forfeitures in the calculation of stock compensation expense  however  sfas r does require such estimation and upon adoption of sfas r  we changed our methodology to include an estimate of forfeitures 
future stock based compensation expense in any particular quarter or year could be affected by changes in our assumptions or changes in market conditions 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data as a percentage of total net sales and contract revenues for the periods indicated 
the following table should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
fiscal year ended march  net sales and contract revenues net sales contract revenues total net sales and contract revenues costs of net sales and contract revenues cost of net sales a cost of contract revenues a gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative a research and development a amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses operating income non operating income expense other income expense  net interest expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax benefit net income a includes stock based compensation expense as a percent of total net sales and contract revenues as follows cost of net sales cost of contract revenues selling  general and administrative expense research and development expense total stock based compensation expense analysis of fiscal  fiscal and fiscal results of operations net sales and contract revenues 
net sales are comprised of roadway sensors sales  which are derived from sales of our vantage video detection systems  and vehicle sensors sales  which are derived from sales of autovue ldw systems  technology access fees  contract engineering revenue and royalty revenue generated from autovue related activities 
contract revenues consist entirely of transportation systems contract revenues  which are generated from systems integration and its consulting services primarily with federal  state  county and municipal agencies 
we currently have a diverse customer base with our largest customer constituting of total net sales and contract revenues in fiscal total net sales and contract revenues increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  and increased in fiscal from million in fiscal net sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  and increased in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in net sales in each of the periods reflected increased unit sales in both roadway sensors and vehicle sensors 
roadway sensors net sales comprised  and of net sales in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and increased in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the majority of roadway sensors net sales were derived from sales within north america 
the fiscal and fiscal increases primarily reflect the continued adoption of video vehicle detection technology  such as the technology offered by our vantage line of products  both domestically and internationally 
fiscal sales growth was not as strong as sales growth in fiscal due primarily to lower sales volumes in texas as a result of local budgetary issues  a trend that we expect to continue for at least the next few fiscal quarters 
we continue to believe that the current increased rate of adoption has to some extent been due to increased government spending on traffic initiatives  which we believe has been at least partially made possible by the passage of the federal highway bill in august  as well as expanded sales and marketing efforts  particularly in north america 
the federal highway bill is set to expire in although we are not aware of any imminent changes in government spending patterns  it is possible that  as a result of softening macroeconomic conditions in the us and the decline in the new housing market  government funding for certain traffic initiatives and roadway improvement projects could be delayed or diverted to focus on other budgetary needs 
should this occur  future domestic roadway sensors net sales may be adversely affected 
net sales from vehicle sensors products and services increased in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal and increased in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the largest element of vehicle sensors net sales was sales of our ldw systems to the heavy truck market  which aggregated million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in fiscal net sales of vehicle sensors products was primarily a result of increased unit sales of our ldw systems to european and asian oems 
the increase in fiscal net sales of vehicle sensors products was primarily related to increased unit sales of ldw systems in the north american commercial heavy truck market  partially offset by oem volume discounts provided to our largest customer and the impact of the transition to our next generation autovue ldw systems for the heavy truck market in the latter part of fiscal although we have experienced an overall increase in unit sales of our autovue ldw systems in recent fiscal years  in fiscal  we began to experience softness in ldw unit sales to the north american truck market as a result of an overall decline in new truck sales in the us driven largely by the general slowdown in the us housing market and overall economy 
we expect flat or declining ldw unit sales in the north american market over at least the next several fiscal quarters due to these macroeconomic conditions 
we have not experienced the same decline in net sales to our european and asian oem customers  however  a slowdown in international truck sales could lead to similar sluggishness in ldw unit sales internationally 
vehicle sensors unit sales in fiscal and beyond could also be adversely impacted by slower than expected adoption rates of our ldw system by european and asian oems and north american heavy truck fleets  as well as potential additional oem volume discounts resulting from increased price competition as new competitors have entered this market 
additionally  recent environmental regulations in europe and north america have substantially increased the cost of new commercial trucks  which could impact future truck sales volumes and  ultimately  unit sales of our ldw systems 
also included in vehicle sensors net sales are revenues from contract engineering services  technology access fees and royalty revenues in the passenger car market that are derived from our strategic relationship with valeo  which aggregated million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
such revenues were lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal and fiscal as a result of technology access fee revenue of  that was recognized in fiscal and fiscal royalty revenues from valeo for sales of our ldw systems for the passenger car market were relatively insignificant in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal our ldw systems are now offered as an option on three infiniti models 
while valeo is currently in discussions to offer our ldw systems on other passenger car platforms  we cannot assure you that valeo will be successful in these efforts 
contract revenues increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and increased in fiscal compared to million in fiscal contract revenues are dependent upon the continued availability of funding at both the state and federal levels from the various departments of transportation 
the fiscal and fiscal increases in contract revenues were largely due to increased funding at the federal  state and local levels throughout the country  as well as new contract awards 
in response to the growth in our transportation systems segment  we increased our transportation systems staff by in fiscal and in fiscal we expect to continue to increase our transportation systems staff in fiscal we believe the ability of our transportation systems business to grow and successfully win and service new contracts will be highly dependent upon our continued success in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel 
all of our contract revenues are derived from work performed in north america under a broad range of fixed price and cost plus fixed fee contracts 
gross profit 
total gross profit increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  and increased in fiscal compared to million in fiscal total gross profit as a percent of net sales and contract revenues increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and decreased in fiscal from in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was a result of a favorable sales mix in terms of both geography and product mix  as well as improved production efficiencies 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales also improved in fiscal through the expansion of our vehicle sensors customer base  which helped mitigate the impact of lower contractual pricing to our largest european customer 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to volume discounts given to our largest vehicle sensors product customer  as well as an overall decline in unit volumes to this customer 
fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales in our roadway sensors division was relatively consistent with fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales can fluctuate in any specific quarter or year based on customer and product mix  as well as possible shifts of engineering resources from development activities to sustaining activities  which we record as cost of goods sold 
gross profit as a percent of net sales has fluctuated over the last five years from a low of in fiscal to a high of in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of contract revenues decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal and decreased from in fiscal we recognize contract revenues and related gross profit using percentage of completion contract accounting and the underlying mix of contract activity affects the related gross profit recognized in any given period 
the decreases in gross profit as a percent of contract revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal  and in fiscal compared to fiscal reflect a contract mix weighted more toward lower margin contracts in those periods 
lower margin contracts generally have a higher proportion of sub consulting revenues associated with them 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to million or of total net sales and contract revenues in fiscal compared to million or of total net sales and contract revenues in fiscal  and increased in fiscal compared to million or of total net sales and contract revenues in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was largely attributable to higher commissions and selling expenses driven by sales growth in our roadway sensors segment  as well as general and administrative expenses incurred related to our efforts to comply with the internal control attestation requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
in fiscal  we expect to continue to experience increased selling  general and administrative expenses as we pursue further sales growth 
furthermore  we expect to experience further increases in general and administrative expenses as we continue our efforts to comply with the internal control attestation requirements of the sarbanes oxley act 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly a result of higher commissions associated with increased roadway sensors net sales and increased sales and marketing activities in our transportation systems segment 
additionally  selling  general and administrative expense included legal expenses associated with the settlement of litigation described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  a severance accrual of approximately  associated with the departure of our former chief executive officer in march and  related to the write off of past due accounts receivable related to rent and other services provided to our former subsidiary  maxxess note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
no further expense is expected to be incurred in connection with the aforementioned lawsuit or the severance arrangement with our former chief executive officer 
we have written off all balances receivable from maxxess based on our accounts receivable accounting policy  but will continue to work with maxxess to attempt to collect amounts due to us 
certain members of our board of directors are part of maxxess management and ownership 
research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased to million or of total net sales and contract revenues in fiscal compared to million or of total net sales and contract revenues in fiscal  and decreased in fiscal compared to million or of total net sales and contract revenues in fiscal the decrease in research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to reduced research and development activities in vehicle sensors as many of our significant truck oem customers now have production ldw units that only require minimal further development and the majority of our passenger car research and development efforts are funded by our strategic partner  valeo 
this decreased spending was partially offset by increased research and development spending in roadway sensors 
we believe research and development activities are crucial to our ability to continue to be a leader in our markets  and we expect our fiscal research and development expenditures to increase from fiscal levels 
the decrease in research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was largely a result of higher than anticipated costs in fiscal in vehicle sensors as we expended significant development resources in qualifying the next generation ldw system with our largest customer  as well as several other heavy truck oems 
additionally  in fiscal  there was a shift in engineering resources from research and development activities to product support activities as a result of new product introductions and improvements in roadway sensors 
costs associated with product support activities are included in cost of net sales rather than research and development expense 
for competitive reasons  we closely guard the confidentiality of specific development projects 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net reflects the following year ended march  in thousands gain on early extinguishment of debt settlement of lawsuits other other income expense  net other income expense  net in fiscal primarily reflects the gain of  we recognized in connection with the early retirement of million of convertible debentures  which is discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
other income expense  net in fiscal primarily reflects  of expense recorded in connection with the settlement of litigation in july  which is discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net reflects the net of interest expense and interest income as follows year ended march  in thousands interest expense interest income interest expense  net interest expense  net decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal and increased in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a lower level of borrowings as well as a lower interest rate on our line of credit  which bears interest at a rate indexed to the prime rate 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was mainly related to the october refinancing of our bank term note and line of credit with a new bank  which resulted in a slightly higher interest rate on our bank borrowings 
income taxes 
during fiscal  we recognized an income tax benefit of million and at march  our consolidated balance sheet included net deferred tax assets of million 
the ability to record the deferred tax asset was based on the more likely than not criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
during fiscal  we recognized an income tax benefit of million and at march   our consolidated balance sheet included net deferred tax assets of million 
the income tax benefits recorded in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal were primarily the result of a decrease in the valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets as a result of changes in estimates of the future realizability of these assets 
in the future  we may continue to record similar adjustments to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance as our estimates are updated 
we anticipate this will cause our future overall effective tax rate in any given period to fluctuate from prior effective tax rates and statutory tax rates 
at march   we had million of federal net operating loss carryforwards and million of state net operating loss carryforwards that begin to expire in and  respectively 
due to changes in stock ownership  our federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to a section limitation estimated at approximately million annually which can be utilized to offset federal consolidated taxable income 
although the impact cannot be precisely determined  we believe that our net operating loss carryforwards and the valuation allowance we have recorded against our net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets will cause us to have future income tax payments and income tax expense that are substantially lower than the income tax liability and income tax expense calculated using statutory tax rates 
in fiscal  we adopted fin see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our implementation of fin stock based compensation expense 
in fiscal  we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective approach 
stock based compensation expense remained relatively consistent in fiscal and fiscal at  and  respectively 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our implementation of sfas r 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows we have historically financed our operations with a combination of cash flows from operations  borrowings under credit facilities and the sale of equity securities 
we currently rely on cash flows from operations and borrowings on a line of credit facility to fund our operations  which we believe to be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
at march   we had million in working capital  which included no borrowings on our million line of credit and  in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to working capital of million at march   which included borrowings of million on our line of credit and  in cash and cash equivalents 
our operations provided million of cash during fiscal  primarily as a result of net income adjusted for non cash items within the statement of operations 
during fiscal  our operations used million of cash  primarily as a result of investments in inventory due to sales growth and longer lead times in procuring certain components  and an increased level of net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings due to sales growth and the timing of invoicing on contracts in our transportation systems segment 
these were partially offset by net income of million 
during fiscal  our operations provided  of cash  primarily as a result of planned decreases in inventory and the timing of payments on accrued expenses and payables  which were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and net costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  both as a result of sales growth 
investing activities for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment  which aggregated   and million  respectively 
in fiscal  capital expenditures were higher primarily due to hardware  software and related labor costs to implement a new enterprise resource management system  which was placed in service at the beginning of fiscal cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  which was the net result of net payments on borrowings of million offset by cash inflows of million from the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase our common stock 
during fiscal  financing activities provided million of cash  which was the net result of net payments on borrowings of million  offset by cash inflows of million from the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase our common stock 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  approximately million of the million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants was raised through the exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock 
during fiscal  financing activities provided million of cash as a result of net borrowings of  and cash inflows of  from the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants to purchase our common stock 
borrowings the following table summarizes our borrowings and long term debt at march  in thousands convertible debentures  net bank term note other in october  we entered into a two year credit facility with a bank which includes our line of credit and bank term note 
the credit facility provides for line of credit borrowings of up to million against our eligible accounts receivable and inventory  as defined in the credit agreement 
the term note provided for monthly principal payments of approximately  and matured in may the interest rate on the line of credit is the current stated prime rate plus  and the interest rate on the bank term note was fixed at an annual rate of 
we are obligated to pay an unused line fee of per annum applied to the amount by which the maximum credit amount exceeds the average daily principal balance during the preceding month 
the credit facility also requires  in monthly collateral management fees and includes an early termination fee equal to of the total facility 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets 
at march   we had million available under our credit facility  all of which was unused 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations were as follows at march  payments due by period thereafter total in thousands notes payable convertible debentures operating leases total at march   we had firm commitments to purchase inventory in the amount of million during the first and second quarters of fiscal off balance sheet arrangements in may  we issued subordinated convertible debentures in an aggregate original principal amount of million 
these debentures are due in full on may  and are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
at march   convertible debentures in an aggregate principal amount of million remained outstanding 
because these debentures are conventionally convertible  we have not separately accounted for the conversion feature and  accordingly  no separate amounts are presented in our consolidated financial statements in connection with this conversion feature 
at march   outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share are callable by us if the market price of our common stock trades for consecutive days at a price equal to or greater than two times the exercise price of the warrants 
outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share are callable by us if the market price of our common stock trades for consecutive days at a price equal to or greater than one and a half times the exercise price of the warrants 
in connection with the issuance of warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share  we are a party to a registration rights agreement that contains provisions under which we could be subjected to liquidated damages should we fail to maintain effective registration statements for the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of certain underlying warrants 
these warrants have been accounted for within equity in our consolidated balance sheets in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  and  accordingly  no liabilities have been recorded in connection therewith 
as of the date of this filing  no liquidated damages are payable under the provisions of the registration rights agreement associated with these warrants 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  rather it specifies valuation methods to be applied when fair value measurements are required under existing or future accounting pronouncements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
in february the fasb issued fsp  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november  generally  this statement will be applied prospectively 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas and expect to adopt sfas in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending march  in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our results of operations and financial condition and expect to adopt sfas in our fiscal year ending march  seasonality we have historically experienced seasonality  particularly with respect to our roadway sensors net sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters due to a reduction in road construction and repairs during the winter months due to inclement weather conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk is limited to our line of credit
