item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
references made to years are for fiscal year periods 
dollar amounts are in thousands  except share and per share data and as indicated 
the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations  financial position  cash flows  indebtedness  and other key financial information of joy global inc and its subsidiaries for fiscal   and for a more complete understanding of this discussion  please read the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
overview we are the direct successor to businesses that have been manufacturing mining equipment for almost years 
we operate in three business segments underground mining machinery  comprised of our joy mining machinery business  surface mining equipment  comprised of our p h mining equipment business and continental crushing conveying 
joy is the world s largest producer of high productivity underground mining equipment used primarily for the extraction of coal 
p h is the world s largest producer of high productivity electric mining shovels and a leading producer of walking draglines and large rotary blasthole drills  used primarily for surface mining copper  coal  iron ore  oil sands  and other minerals 
ccc is a worldwide leader in breakage equipment and conveyor systems for bulk material handling in mining and industrial applications 
in addition to selling new equipment  we provide parts  components  repairs  rebuilds  diagnostic analysis  fabrication  training  and other aftermarket services for our installed base of machines 
in the case of surface mining equipment  we also provide aftermarket services for equipment manufactured by other companies  including manufacturers with which we have ongoing relationships and which we refer to as alliance partners 
we emphasize our aftermarket products and services as an integral part of lowering our customers cost per unit of production and are focused on continuing to grow this part of our business 
original equipment sales have ranged from million in fiscal to billion in fiscal our aftermarket business has shown more consistent growth since fiscal with sales ranging from million in to billion in fiscal along with record revenues in fiscal  our backlog has also continued to grow 
our backlog of billion as of october  increased to billion as of october  driven by increased original equipment orders for expansion projects as well as aftermarket products and services to support the high utilization of the current installed fleet 
demand for new equipment is cyclical in nature  being driven by commodity prices and other factors 
the evolving economic crisis increasingly impacts the outlook for the mining industry 
slowing of the world s economies is reducing demand for commodities  forcing prices down and limiting mining company cash flows 
this combination has created a general downward bias on commodity prices 
as a result of this outlook  we expect our customers to become more selective about their next new mine expansion projects  but at the same time expect projects to continue to be approved 
approximately of our sales in fiscal were recorded at the time of shipment of the product or delivery of the service 
the remaining of sales was recorded using percentage of completion accounting  a practice we follow in recognizing revenue on the sale of long lead time equipment such as electric mining shovels  walking draglines  powered roof support systems and conveyor systems 
under percentage of completion accounting  revenue is recognized on firm orders from customers as the product is manufactured based on the ratio of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs to be incurred 
we generally receive progress payments on long lead time equipment 
operating results of fiscal were indicative of the strength of the underground coal market in the us and overall strength of surfaced mined commodities  including coal  iron ore  and copper for the most part of fiscal net sales for fiscal totaled billion  compared with billion in fiscal the acquisition of continental in the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal added million of revenue for the year  the continued strength of all surface markets added million and the rebound of the us underground activity page contributed million 
operating income totaled million in fiscal  up million from fiscal the increase in operating income was the result of increased sales related to strong demand across all surface and underground markets  offset by increased incentive based compensation expense of million and a million charge related to a maintenance and repair contract in australia 
net income was million  or per diluted share in fiscal compared with million or per diluted share in the prior year 
results of operations compared with sales the following table sets forth fiscal and fiscal net sales as derived from our consolidated statement of income fiscal fiscal in thousands change change net sales underground mining machinery surface mining equipment crushing conveying eliminations total the increase in net sales for underground mining machinery in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of a million increase in original equipment combined with a million increase in aftermarket products and service 
after a challenging fiscal  the central appalachia region of the united states experienced growth across substantially all original equipment product lines 
china s original equipment sales also increased primarily due to increased armored face conveyor and shearer sales 
increased original equipment sales were reported in eurasia primarily due to the sale of a powered roof support system in fiscal united states aftermarket sales increased reflecting continued investment in both existing and greenfield metallurgical and thermal projects 
the increase in net sales for surface mining equipment in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of a million increase in original equipment combined with a million increase in aftermarket parts and service 
increases in original equipment sales due to timing of production schedules primarily consisted of increased shovel revenue in the canadian oil sands  the united states  chile and china 
as a result of the increasing installed base of electric mining shovels  aftermarket sales increased by million in the united states  million in chile and million in canada 
the net sales in crushing conveying represented the strength of the crushing equipment and conveying systems and aftermarket parts and services in the united states  australia and the united kingdom 
revenue from this segment was included from the february  acquisition date of nes investment co 
the eliminations represent the stamler crushing equipment which is sold through the underground mining machinery and surface mining equipment segments but managed as part of the crushing conveying segment 
page operating income the following table sets forth fiscal and fiscal operating income as derived from our consolidated statement of income fiscal fiscal operating operating in thousands income loss of net sales income loss of net sales operating income loss underground mining machinery surface mining equipment crushing conveying corporate expense eliminations total operating income for underground mining machinery increased to million in fiscal  or of sales  as compared to million in fiscal  or of sales 
the increase in operating income was principally due to the impact of higher volume of million and lower pension expense of million  partially offset by the impact of a greater mix of lower margin original equipment of million  and increased performance based incentive compensation of million 
operating income for surface mining equipment increased to million in fiscal  or of sales  as compared to million in fiscal  or of sales 
the increase in operating income was principally due to increased sales volume of million offset by the settlement of a maintenance and repair contract in australia of million  increased performance based incentive compensation of million  the retiree benefit cost associated upon the execution of the steelworkers agreement in milwaukee of million and increased selling  general and administrative expenses to support the global mining infrastructure 
operating income for crushing conveying included million of purchase accounting charges in fiscal corporate expense increased by million due to increased performance based compensation  legal fees and severance costs 
the eliminations represent the stamler crushing equipment which is sold through the underground mining machinery and surface mining equipment segment but managed as part of the crushing conveying segment 
product development  selling and administrative expense product development  selling and administrative expense for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal the increase in product development  selling and administrative expense was primarily due to of additional expenses related to the continental acquisition  million of higher selling expenses related to increased business activity and increase in administrative costs due to increased incentive based compensation of million and global infrastructure development 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rates from continuing operations were and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
income tax expense from continuing operations decreased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the main drivers of the variance in tax rates and income tax expense page were higher utilization of us foreign tax credits and the associated subpart f earnings  tax holidays and incentives in fiscal  us state income taxes  mix of earnings year over year and differences in local statutory tax rates 
a discrete tax benefit of million was recorded in fiscal to reflect us foreign tax credits recognition offset partially by us subpart f income not previously recognized  completion of an r d study to validate the credits available and offset by the tax required on a dividend between foreign subsidiaries 
fiscal also included a discrete tax expense of million which included taxes on dividends received from foreign subsidiaries during the fourth quarter not previously forecasted  the resolution of an r d study which resulted in the write off of pre bankruptcy r d credits  and a reserve added following the quarterly evaluation of a previously disclosed contingent tax liability in south africa 
a review of uncertain income tax positions was performed throughout fiscal and as part of the overall income tax provision and a net benefit of million and million  respectively  was recorded on a global basis 
compared with sales the following table sets forth fiscal and fiscal net sales as derived from our consolidated statement of income fiscal fiscal in thousands change change net sales underground mining machinery surface mining equipment total the slight decrease in net sales for underground mining machinery in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of a million decrease in original equipment combined with a million increase in aftermarket products and service 
weakness in the central appalachia region of the united states resulted in a decrease across substantially all original equipment product lines 
china s original equipment sales also decreased primarily due to lower armored face conveyor and powered roof support sales and on more local competition 
offsetting the impact of the united states and china  increased original equipment sales were reported in australia and associated with stamler 
international aftermarket sales increased in south africa and china reflecting continued high level of coal mining activity on a global basis 
the increase in net sales for surface mining equipment in fiscal compared to fiscal was the result of a million increase in original equipment combined with a million increase in aftermarket parts and service 
increases in original equipment sales due to timing of production schedules primarily consisted of increased shovel revenue in two key markets  the canadian oil sands and china 
aftermarket sales increases were primarily due to million in emerging markets and million in the united states and most notably in the southwest region of the united states 
the emerging market increase was primarily related to continued strength of coal markets in china and russia  while the southwest increase was due to the continued global demand for copper 
page operating income the following table sets forth fiscal and fiscal operating income as derived from our consolidated statement of income fiscal fiscal operating operating in thousands income loss of net sales income loss of net sales operating income loss underground mining machinery surface mining equipment corporate expense total operating income as a percentage of net sales for underground mining machinery decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in operating income was principally due to increased warranty expense of million and increased product development  selling and administrative expense of million offset by a greater mix of higher margin aftermarket sales and decreased incentive compensation expense 
the increase in product development  selling and administrative expense was related to international infrastructure development  the inclusion of stamler for all of fiscal  and increased pension expense 
operating income as a percentage of net sales for surface mining equipment increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in operating income was principally due to increased sales volume of million and a more profitable mix of original equipment and aftermarket sales 
product development  selling and administrative expenses were up approximately million in fiscal  but were down percentage points in comparison to net sales year over year 
product development  selling and administrative expense product development  selling and administrative expense for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal the increase in product development  selling and administrative expense was primarily due to million of increased warranty costs  million of costs related to the development and expansion of global infrastructure  million of expenses related to the inclusion of stamler for all of fiscal  million of foreign exchange impact  million increase in pension expense  and general inflation 
this increase was offset by a million decrease in incentive based compensation expense 
interest expense interest expense for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal the million increase was principally due to the november issuance of million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due the proceeds from the notes were primarily used to finance our common stock repurchase program and to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit agreement 
provision for income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rates from continuing operations for fiscal and fiscal were approximately and  respectively 
consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the main drivers of the variance in tax rates and income tax expense were us subpart f earnings  us state income taxes  mix of earnings year over year  differences in local statutory tax rates and the reversal of certain us and australian deferred income tax valuation reserves in fiscal fiscal also included tax adjustments of million which included taxes on dividends received from foreign subsidiaries during the quarter not previously forecasted  the resolution of an r d study which resulted in page the write off of pre bankruptcy r d credits  and a reserve added following the quarterly evaluation of a previously disclosed contingent tax liability in south africa 
a review of income tax valuation reserves was performed throughout fiscal as part of the overall income tax provision and a net benefit of million was recorded on a global basis 
for fiscal  a tax benefit of million was recorded relating to the reversal of certain valuation reserves  principally million applicable to us deferred income tax assets and million related to certain deferred income tax assets applicable to our australian consolidated tax group 
reorganization items reorganization items include income  expenses  and losses that were realized or incurred by the predecessor company as a result of its decision to reorganize under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
net reorganization items for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal consisted of the following fiscal fiscal fiscal in thousands expense income beloit uk claim settlement resolution of contingent payable professional fees directly related to the reorganization net reorganization expense income critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  excess inventory  warranty  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the accounting policies described below are the ones that most frequently require us to make estimates and judgments  and therefore are critical to the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue at the time of shipment and passage of title for sales of products and at the time of performance for sales of services 
we recognize revenue on long term contracts  such as the manufacture of mining shovels  drills  draglines and roof support systems  using either the percentage of completion or inventory sales methods 
when using the percentage of completion method  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion 
sales and gross profit are adjusted prospectively for revisions in estimated total contract costs and contract values 
estimated losses are recognized in full when identified 
we have life cycle management contracts with customers to supply parts and service for terms of to years 
these contracts are set up based on the projected costs and revenues of servicing the respective machines over the specified contract terms 
accounting for these contracts requires us to make various estimates  including estimates of the relevant machine s long term maintenance requirements 
under these contracts  customers are generally billed monthly and the respective deferred revenues are recorded when billed 
revenue is recognized in the period in which parts are supplied or services provided 
these contracts are reviewed periodically and revenue recognition page is adjusted appropriately for future estimated costs 
if a loss is expected at any time  the full amount of the loss is recognized immediately 
in limited circumstances  we have customer agreements that are multiple element arrangements as defined by the financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the agreements are considered for multiple elements based on the following criteria the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item and the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  and delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the control of the vendor 
revenue is then allocated to each identified unit of accounting based on our estimate of their relative fair values 
revenue recognition involves judgments  assessments of expected returns  the likelihood of nonpayment  and estimates of expected costs and profits on long term contracts 
we analyze various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  credit worthiness of customers  and current market and economic conditions  in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or net realizable value using the first in  first out fifo method for all inventories 
we evaluate the need to record valuation adjustments for inventory on a regular basis 
our policy is to evaluate all inventories including raw material  work in process  finished goods  and spare parts 
inventory in excess of our estimated usage requirements is written down to its estimated net realizable value 
inherent in the estimates of net realizable value are estimates related to our future manufacturing schedules  customer demand  possible alternative uses  and ultimate realization of potentially excess inventory 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets include drawings  patents  trademarks  technology  customer relationships and other specifically identifiable assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not being amortized 
these assets are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed  which is principally the straight line method 
intangible assets that are subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes occur that suggest impairment in carrying value 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is tested for impairment using the two step approach  in accordance with statement on financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
goodwill is assigned to specific reporting units and tested for impairment at least annually  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently upon the occurrence of an event or when circumstances indicate that a reporting unit s carrying amount is greater than its fair value 
management judgment is used in the development of assumptions in the impairment testing process  including growth and discount rate assumptions 
we performed our goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of fiscal and no impairment was identified 
accrued warranties we record accruals for potential warranty claims based on prior claim experience 
warranty costs are accrued at the time revenue is recognized 
these warranty costs are based upon management s assessment of past claims and current experience 
however  actual claims could be higher or lower than amounts estimated  as the amount and value of warranty claims are subject to variation as a result of many factors that cannot be predicted with certainty 
pension and postretirement benefits and costs we have pension and postretirement benefits and expenses which are developed from actuarial valuations 
these valuations are based on assumptions including  among other things  discount rates  expected returns on plan page assets  retirement ages  years of service  future salary increases  and future health care cost trend rates 
future changes affecting the assumptions will change the related pension benefit or expense 
as such  a 
change in the discount rate and rate of return on net assets would have the following effects on projected benefit obligation and pension expense  respectively  as of and for the fiscal year ended october  
increase 
decrease expected expected discount long term discount long term in thousands rate rate of return rate rate of return u 
s pension plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation non us pension plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation other postretirement benefit plans net pension expense projected benefit obligation income taxes deferred taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using statutory tax rates 
deferred income tax provisions are based on changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities from period to period  adjusted for certain reclassifications under fresh start accounting 
additionally  we analyze our ability to recognize the net deferred tax assets created in each jurisdiction in which we operate to determine if valuation allowances are necessary based on the more likely than not criteria 
as required under the application of fresh start accounting  the release of pre emergence tax valuation reserves was not recorded in the income statement but instead was treated first as a reduction of excess reorganization value until exhausted  then intangibles until exhausted  and thereafter reported as additional paid in capital 
consequently  a net tax charge will be incurred in future years when these tax assets are utilized 
we will continue to monitor the appropriateness of the existing valuation allowances and determine annually the amount of valuation allowances that are required to be maintained 
as of october   there were million of valuation allowances against pre emergence net operating loss carryforwards 
all future reversals of pre emergence valuation allowances will be recorded to additional paid in capital 
we estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year on an interim basis 
the estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned eg  united states compared to non united states as well as tax planning strategies 
if the actual results are different from these estimates  adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made 
additionally  discrete items are treated separately from the effective rate analysis and are recorded separately as an income tax provision or benefit at the time they are recognized 
to the extent recognized  these items will impact the effective tax rate in aggregate but will not adjust the amount used for future periods within the same fiscal year 
page liquidity and capital resources working capital and cash flow are two financial measurements that provide an indication of our ability to meet our financial obligations 
we currently use a combination of cash generated by operations  borrowings on our line of credit and debt offerings to fund continuing operations 
the following table summarizes the major elements of our working capital as of october  and october   respectively october  october  in millions cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable inventories other current assets short term notes payable  including current portion of long term obligations accounts payable employee compensation and benefits advance payments and progress billings accrued warranties other accrued liabilities working capital we currently use working capital and cash flow production as two financial measurements to evaluate the performance of our operations and our ability to meet our financial obligations 
we continue to require working capital investment to maintain our position as a leading manufacturer and servicer of high productivity mining equipment 
the primary drivers of these requirements are funding for purchases of production and replacement parts inventories 
our position as a market leader in providing timely service and repair requires us to maintain a certain level of replacement parts 
as part of our continuous improvement of purchasing and manufacturing processes  we continue to strive for alignment of inventory levels with customer demand and current production schedules 
we expect fiscal capital spending to be between and of sales 
this represents an increase from fiscal capital spending as a percentage of sales of up to 
capital projects will be monitored to ensure alignment with customer needs and prevailing economic conditions 
in addition  cash is required for capital expenditures for the repair  replacement  and upgrading of existing facilities 
we have debt service requirements  including commitment and letter of credit fees under our revolving credit facility and biannual interest payments due to holders of our senior notes issued in november we believe that cash generated from operations  together with borrowings available under our credit facility  provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our operating and debt service requirements and planned capital expenditures 
for the long term the fundamentals of the commodity cycle remain positive  near term softness will require continuous reevaluation of new projects to ensure that we are effectively allocating resources in line with current market conditions 
in fiscal  we completed a million  square foot expansion in proprietary component machining capabilities for p h mining at our tianjin  china campus  with first piece runoff of currently installed equipment completed early in the fourth quarter of fiscal  with full production targeted for the second half of fiscal as we look to provide more efficient operations amongst our customers and three operating segments  we are in the process of consolidating six smaller existing facilities in australia into one combined underground and surface mining service center and manufacturing facility 
page cash provided by operations for fiscal was million as compared to million provided by operations for fiscal the increase in our cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to our continued focus on obtaining advance payments for original equipment 
the increase in advance payments was offset by further increases in inventory and accounts receivable 
inventory management and forecasting remains a key initiative for us in fiscal cash used by investment activities for fiscal was million as compared to million used by investment activities for fiscal the increase in cash used by investment activities was primarily due to the million acquisition of continental in the second quarter of fiscal capital expenditures increased by million in fiscal up to million primarily related to the upgrade of existing facilities  machines tools related to the tianjin facility  further sap implementations  and other projects 
cash used by financing activities for fiscal was million as compared to million used by financing activities for fiscal the cash used by financing activities for fiscal primarily consisted of the repurchase of outstanding stock of million  offset by the increase of million outstanding on our term loan supplement under the revolving credit facility 
during fiscal  we contributed million to our worldwide pension plans compared to million during fiscal although no contributions were required to be made to qualified us plans  a contribution of million was made in fiscal in order to maintain plan flexibility 
we expect to make required contributions of million to our us plans and million to our us plans in fiscal the significance of the required funding requirements of our pension plans will be largely based on the investment performance of the plans assets  the actual results of the other actuarial assumptions and most importantly  the impact of the pension protection act of ppa 
continental acquisition on february  we completed the acquisition of nes investment co 
parent and thereby its subsidiary  continental global group  inc a worldwide leader in conveyor systems for bulk material handling in mining and industrial applications 
the continental acquisition further strengthens our ability to provide a more complete mining solution to our customers 
we purchased all of the outstanding shares of the parent for an aggregate amount of million  which was net of approximately million of indebtedness we assumed at closing and million of cash acquired 
we also incurred million of direct acquisition costs related to the acquisition 
the purchase price was funded in part through available cash and credit resources and a new million term loan supplement to our existing credit agreement second amendment  as discussed below 
following the continental acquisition  the reportable segments for joy global inc were reevaluated and a new segment was created  crushing conveying 
included in the crushing conveying segment is the entire acquired continental entity  along with the stamler crushing equipment business  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal the stamler crushing equipment is currently being sold through the underground mining machinery or surface mining equipment segments to third parties  but is being supplied to each unit through the crushing conveying segment 
credit facilities we have a million unsecured revolving credit facility credit agreement which expires november  outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to the london interbank offered rate libor rate defined as applicable libor rate for the equivalent interest period plus to or the base rate defined as the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus at our option 
we pay a commitment fee ranging from to on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility based on our credit rating 
the credit agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial covenants including leverage and interest coverage 
the credit agreement also restricts payments of dividends or other return of capital based on the consolidated leverage ratio 
at october   we were in compliance with all financial covenants in the credit agreement and had no restrictions on the payment of dividends or return of capital 
page at october   there were no direct borrowings under the credit agreement 
outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit agreement  which count toward the million credit limit  totaled million 
at october   there was million available for borrowings under the credit agreement 
the continental acquisition was funded in part through the second amendment  which calls for quarterly principal payments of of the initial term loan through october   at which time the remaining outstanding principal equal to of the initial term loan is due 
as of october   million is outstanding on the term loan 
outstanding borrowings bear interest equal to the libor rate which has a weighted average interest rate of 
as part of the second amendment  we have the option to request an increase to the term loan outstanding not to exceed million 
no changes were made to existing financial covenants in fiscal in november  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due notes with interest on the notes being paid semi annually in arrears on may and november of each year  starting on may  the notes are guaranteed by each of our current and future significant domestic subsidiaries 
the notes were issued in a private placement under an exemption from registration provided by the securities act of securities act  as amended 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the notes were exchanged for similar notes registered under the securities act 
at our option  we may redeem some or all of the notes at a redemption price of the greater of of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the principal amounts and the remaining scheduled interest payments using a discount rate equal to the sum of a treasury rate of a comparable treasury issue plus for the notes and for the notes 
our credit rating by both standard and poor s and moody s has remained consistent in fiscal standard and poor s credit rating is bbb with an outlook of stable 
moody s credit rating is baa with a continued outlook of stable 
in the first quarter of fiscal  moody s confirmed the baa rating with a positive outlook 
these investment grade credit ratings provide us with greater flexibility to access financing on the open market as our business circumstances justify 
advance payments and progress billings as part of the negotiation process associated with original equipment orders  there are generally advance payments obtained from our customers 
as of october   advance payments and progress billings were million 
as orders are shipped or costs incurred  the advanced payments and progress billings are reclassified to revenue on the consolidated income statement 
stock repurchase program under our original share repurchase program  management is authorized to repurchase up to billion in shares in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions until december  on september   the board of directors revised the authorization to permit the repurchase of up to an additional billion of outstanding common stock until december  during fiscal and fiscal  we repurchased million of common stock representing  shares and million of common stock  representing  shares  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements we lease various assets under operating leases 
the aggregate payments under operating leases as of october  are disclosed in the table of disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments below 
no significant changes to lease commitments have occurred since october  we have no other off balance sheet arrangements 
page disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of october  less than more than in thousands total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations purchase obligations operating leases total new accounting pronouncements our new accounting pronouncements are set forth under item of this annual report and are incorporated herein by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk volatility in interest rates  commodity price risk  and foreign exchange rates can impact our earnings  equity  and cash flow 
from time to time we undertake transactions to hedge this impact 
under generally accepted accounting principles  a hedge instrument is considered effective if it offsets partially or completely the impact on earnings  equity  and cash flow due to fluctuations in interest  commodity  and foreign exchange rates 
in accordance with our policy  we do not execute derivatives that are speculative or that increase our risk from interest rate  commodity price  or foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on long term debt obligations 
the interest rate environment causes volatility in our variable rate borrowings and affects the value of our fixed rate debt 
we manage this risk through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt see note borrowings and credit facilities 
at october  we were not party to any interest rate derivative contracts 
commodity price risk for most of fiscal  the increased global demand for certain commodities correlated directly with the risk of higher prices for certain raw materials 
as compared to fiscal  the higher consumption levels of steel from emerging markets continued to increase prices we were charged 
we currently manage this risk by passing on a portion of these price increases to our customers 
at october   we are not party to any commodity forward contracts 
foreign currency risk most of our foreign subsidiaries use local currencies as their functional currency 
for consolidation purposes  assets and liabilities are translated at month end exchange rates 
items of income and expense are translated at average exchange rates 
translation gains and losses are not included in determining net income loss but are accumulated as a separate component of shareholders equity 
gains losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in determining net income loss 
during fiscal  we realized a gain of million arising from foreign currency transactions 
foreign exchange derivatives at october  were in the form of forward exchange contracts executed over the counter 
there is a concentration of these contracts held with bank of america  na which maintains an investment grade rating 
page we have a risk averse foreign exchange risk management policy under which significant exposures that impact earnings and cash flows are fully hedged 
exposures that impact only equity or do not have a cash flow impact are generally not hedged with derivatives 
we hedge two categories of foreign exchange exposures assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency  which include future committed receipts or payments denominated in a foreign currency and certain us functional currency entity balance sheet accounts denominated in local currencies 
these exposures normally arise from imports and exports of goods and from intercompany trade and lending activity
