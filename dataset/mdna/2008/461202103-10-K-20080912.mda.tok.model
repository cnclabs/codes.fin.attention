this summary is not intended to be exhaustive  nor is it intended to be a substitute for the detailed discussion and analysis provided elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview of financial results total net revenue for fiscal was billion  up compared with fiscal the fiscal revenue increase was driven by our acquisition of digital insight and revenue growth in our consumer tax segment 
excluding the impact of our acquisitions of digital insight  homestead  and echo and the transition of certain outsourced payroll customers in connection with a sale of assets to adp  we estimate that total net revenue for fiscal would have increased compared with fiscal operating income from continuing operations of million for fiscal increased compared with million for fiscal fiscal revenue growth was almost completely offset by higher costs of revenue and higher operating expenses 
higher costs and expenses in fiscal reflect our acquisition of digital insight  which has a higher cost structure than our other businesses  higher costs of revenue associated with revenue growth in our other segments  increased investment in research and development for new and existing offerings  and increases in advertising and other marketing spending to support our consumer tax offerings 
in addition  share based compensation expense increased approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal  and we recorded a million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal in connection with a reallocation of resources to key growth businesses 
the effects of these factors are described in more detail under cost of revenue and operating expenses below 

table of contents net income from continuing operations of million for fiscal increased compared with million for fiscal and diluted net income per share from continuing operations of for fiscal increased compared with for fiscal in fiscal we incurred interest expense of million  compared with million in fiscal interest expense for both periods related primarily to the senior notes we issued in march we also recorded a pre tax gain of million on the sale of certain outsourced payroll assets to adp in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal our effective tax rates for fiscal and fiscal were approximately and 
average shares outstanding declined during fiscal as a result of repurchases of million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase programs  partially offset by the issuance of million shares in connection with our employee stock plans 
in august we sold our intuit distribution management solutions idms business for approximately million in cash and recorded a net gain on disposal of million 
idms was part of our other businesses segment 
we have accounted for idms as a discontinued operation and segregated the operating results of idms from continuing operations for all periods presented 
in december we acquired homestead technologies inc for total consideration of approximately million on a fully diluted basis 
homestead is a provider of web site design and hosting services to small businesses and became part of our quickbooks segment 
in february we acquired electronic clearing house  inc for a total purchase price of approximately million in cash 
echo is a provider of electronic payment processing services to small businesses and became part of our payroll and payments segment 
during the third quarter of fiscal we completed the transition of certain outsourced payroll customers in connection with a sale of assets to adp 
see non operating income and expenses dispositions and discontinued operations later in this item for more information 
we ended fiscal with cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million  a decrease of million from july  this decrease was due in part to the reclassification of million in municipal auction rate securities to long term investments during fiscal see liquidity and capital resources auction rate securities  later in this item for more information 
in fiscal we generated million in cash from continuing operations  million from sales of investments  million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans  and million from the sale of our idms business 
during the same period we used million in cash for the repurchase of shares of our common stock under our stock repurchase programs  million for capital expenditures  and million for acquisitions of businesses  including homestead and echo 
at july   we had authorization from our board to expend up to million for stock repurchases through may  seasonality our quickbooks  consumer tax and accounting professionals businesses are highly seasonal 
some of our other offerings are also seasonal  but to a lesser extent 
revenue from our quickbooks software products tends to be highest during our second and third fiscal quarters  although the timing of new product releases or changes in our offerings can materially shift revenue between quarters 
sales of income tax preparation products and services are heavily concentrated in the period from november through april 
in our consumer tax business  a greater proportion of our revenue has been occurring later in this seasonal period due in part to the growth in sales of turbotax online  for which revenue is recognized upon printing or electronic filing of a tax return 
the seasonality of our consumer tax and accounting professionals revenue is also affected by the timing of the availability of tax forms from taxing agencies and the ability of those agencies to receive electronic tax return submissions 
delays in the availability of tax forms or the ability of taxing agencies to receive submissions can cause revenue to shift from our second fiscal quarter to our third fiscal quarter 
these seasonal patterns mean that our total net revenue is usually highest during our second quarter ending january and third quarter ending april we typically report losses in our first quarter ending october and fourth quarter ending july  when revenue from our tax businesses is minimal while operating expenses continue at relatively consistent levels 
we believe the seasonality of our revenue is likely to continue in the future 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our net revenue  operating income or loss and net income or loss  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our balance sheet 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
senior management has reviewed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and their disclosure in this annual report on form k with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of packaged software products  license fees  software subscriptions  product support  hosting services  payroll services  merchant services  professional services  transaction fees and multiple element arrangements that may include any combination of these items 
we follow the appropriate revenue recognition rules for each type of revenue 
for additional information  see revenue recognition in note to the financial statements in item we generally recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for example  for multiple element arrangements we must make assumptions and judgments in order to allocate the total price among the various elements we must deliver  to determine whether undelivered services are essential to the functionality of the delivered products and services  to determine whether vendor specific evidence of fair value exists for each undelivered element and to determine whether and when each element has been delivered 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
amounts for fees collected or invoiced and due relating to arrangements where revenue cannot be recognized are reflected on our balance sheet as deferred revenue and recognized when the applicable revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
in connection with the sale of certain products  we provide a limited amount of free technical support assistance to customers 
we do not defer the recognition of any revenue associated with sales of these products since the cost of providing this free technical support is insignificant 
the technical support is generally provided within one year after the associated revenue is recognized and free product enhancements are minimal and infrequent 
we accrue the estimated cost of providing this free support upon product shipment 
return and rebate reserves as part of our revenue recognition policy  we estimate future product returns and rebate payments and establish reserves against revenue at the time of sale based on these estimates 
our return policy allows distributors and retailers  subject to contractual limitations  to return purchased products 
product returns by distributors and retailers relate primarily to the return of excess and obsolete products 
in determining our product returns reserves  we consider the volume and price mix of products in the retail channel  historical return rates for prior releases of the product  trends in retailer inventory and economic trends that might impact customer demand for our products including the competitive environment and the timing of new releases of our products 
we fully reserve for excess and obsolete products in the distribution channels 
our rebate reserves include distributor and retailer sales incentive rebates and end user rebates 
our estimated reserves for distributor and retailer incentive rebates are based on distributors and retailers actual performance against the terms and conditions of rebate programs  which we typically establish annually 
our reserves for end user rebates are estimated based on the terms and conditions of the specific promotional rebate program  actual sales during the promotion and historical redemption trends by product and by type of promotional program 
in the past  actual returns and rebates have not differed significantly from the reserves that we have established 
however  actual returns and rebates in any future period are inherently uncertain 
if we were to change our assumptions and estimates  our revenue reserves would change  which would impact the net revenue we report 
if actual returns and rebates are significantly greater than the reserves we have established  the actual results would decrease our future reported revenue 
conversely  if actual returns and rebates are significantly less than our 
table of contents reserves  this would increase our future reported revenue 
for example  if we had increased our fiscal returns reserves by of non consignment sales to retailers for quickbooks  turbotax and quicken  our total net revenue for fiscal would have been million lower 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
the accounts receivable amount on our balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses 
we also make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations  and we assess current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
our reserves have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that our reserves will continue to be adequate 
if actual credit losses are significantly greater than the reserve we have established  that would increase our general and administrative expenses and reduce our reported net income 
conversely  if actual credit losses are significantly less than our reserve  this would eventually decrease our general and administrative expenses and increase our reported net income 
business combinations purchase accounting under the purchase method of accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
we record the excess of purchase price over the aggregate fair values as goodwill 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
these valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing purchased technology  customer lists and other identifiable intangible assets include future cash flows that we expect to generate from the acquired assets 
if the subsequent actual results and updated projections of the underlying business activity change compared with the assumptions and projections used to develop these values  we could experience impairment charges 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain acquired assets and these lives are used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  depreciation or amortization expenses could be accelerated or slowed 
goodwill  purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets impairment assessments we make judgments about the recoverability of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
we test the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
the timing of the formal annual test may result in charges to our statement of operations in our fourth fiscal quarter that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
in order to estimate the fair value of long lived assets  we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the business that the asset relates to  consider market factors specific to that business and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that business 
we evaluate cash flows at the lowest operating level and the number of reporting units that we have identified may make impairment more probable than it would be at a company with fewer reporting units and integrated operations following acquisitions 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset stated on our balance sheet to reflect its estimated fair value 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy and our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions and estimates could materially impact our reported financial results 
more conservative estimates of the anticipated future benefits from these businesses could result in impairment charges  which would decrease net income and result in lower asset values on our balance sheet 
conversely  less conservative estimates could result in smaller or no impairment charges  higher net income and higher asset values 
at july   we had billion in goodwill and million in net purchased intangible assets on our balance sheet 

table of contents accounting for share based compensation plans we account for share based compensation using the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based payment 
at july   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested share based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average vesting period of years 
we use a lattice binomial model and the assumptions shown in note to the financial statements in item to estimate the fair value of stock options granted 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on implied exercise patterns using a binomial model 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the implied volatility of publicly traded one year and two year options on our common stock  consistent with sfas r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in our option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on constant maturity us treasury issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in our option valuation model 
in accordance with sfas r  we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we amortize the fair value of options on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
we may elect to use different assumptions under our option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 
we value restricted stock units using the intrinsic value method 
we amortize the value of restricted stock units on a straight line basis over the restriction period 
legal contingencies we are subject to certain legal proceedings  as well as demands  claims and threatened litigation that arise in the normal course of our business 
we review the status of each significant matter quarterly and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability and an expense for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination of whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
our accruals are based on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
potential legal liabilities and the revision of estimates of potential legal liabilities could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
income taxes estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes and valuation allowance when we prepare our financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on the various jurisdictions where we conduct business 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdiction 
we estimate our current tax liability and assess temporary differences that result from differing treatments of certain items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we show on our balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
to the extent we believe that realization is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
when we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in an accounting period  we record a corresponding tax expense in our statement of operations 
our net deferred tax asset at july  was million and we had no valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets at that date 
while we have considered future taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we could in the future be required to record a valuation allowance to take into account deferred tax assets 
table of contents that we may be unable to realize 
an increase in a valuation allowance would have an adverse impact  which could be material  on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which we record the increase 
we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
on august  see note to the financial statements in item as a result of our adoption of fin we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit  the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions 
we evaluate our uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
our evaluations are based upon a number of factors  including changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  correspondence with tax authorities during the course of audits and effective settlement of audit issues 
changes in the recognition or measurement of uncertain tax positions could result in material increases or decreases in our income tax expense in the period in which we make the change  which could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and operating results

table of contents other businesses fiscal compared with fiscal other businesses segment operating income as a percentage of related revenue decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal about a quarter of the million in fiscal revenue growth in this segment came from our intuit real estate solutions business  which sells its products and services through a direct sales force and therefore has a higher cost structure than the other businesses in this segment 
while revenue from our business in canada was higher in fiscal due in part to the weaker us dollar  total costs and expenses for this business also increased due to the impact of foreign exchange rates

our effective tax rate for fiscal differed from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to state income taxes  which were partially offset by the benefit we received from tax exempt interest income  federal and state research and experimental credits and the domestic production activities deduction

in december the tax relief and health care act of was signed into law 
the act included a reinstatement of the federal research and experimental credit through december  that was retroactive to january  we recorded a discrete tax benefit of million for the retroactive amount related to fiscal during fiscal tax carryforwards we acquired electronic clearing house and homestead in fiscal and digital insight in fiscal see note to the financial statements in item these companies had federal net operating loss carryforwards at their respective dates of acquisition that totaled approximately million 
we have recorded the tax effects of these carryforwards and other federal tax credit carryforwards  which together totaled approximately million  as deferred tax assets at the respective dates of acquisition 
the carryforwards do not result in an income tax provision benefit  but they reduce income taxes payable and cash paid for income taxes as we utilize them 
at july   we had total federal net operating loss carryforwards of million that will expire starting in fiscal net deferred tax assets at july   we had net deferred tax assets of million and no valuation allowance 
while we believe no valuation allowance was appropriate at that date  it may be necessary to record a valuation allowance if it becomes more likely that we will not realize some portion of the net deferred tax assets 
we assess the need for an adjustment to the valuation allowance on a quarterly basis 
the assessment is based on our estimates of future sources of taxable income for the jurisdictions in which we operate and the periods over which our deferred tax assets will be realizable

intuit distribution management solutions discontinued operations in august we sold our intuit distribution management solutions idms business for approximately million in cash and recorded a net gain on disposal of million 
idms was part of our other businesses segment

revenue from its was million in fiscal liquidity and capital resources overview at july   our cash  cash equivalents and investments totaled million  a decrease of million from july  this decrease was due to the reclassification of million in municipal auction rate securities to long term investments see auction rate securities below and to the factors described in statements of cash flows below 
our primary source of liquidity has been cash from operations  which entails the collection of accounts receivable for products and services 
our primary uses of cash have been for research and development programs  selling and marketing activities  capital projects  debt service costs  repurchases of common stock and acquisitions of businesses 
in march we issued five year and ten year senior unsecured notes totaling billion 
we also have a million unsecured revolving line of credit facility that is described later in this item to date we have not borrowed under the facility 
the following table summarizes selected measures of our liquidity and capital resources at the dates indicated july  july  dollars in millions change change cash  cash equivalents and investments long term investments nm long term debt working capital ratio of current assets to current liabilities nm not meaningful auction rate securities at july   we held million in municipal auction rate securities 
these securities are collateralized long term debt instruments that provide liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  typically every days 
due to a decrease in liquidity in the global credit markets  in february auctions began failing for the municipal auction rate securities we held 
regularly scheduled 
table of contents auctions for these securities have generally continued to fail since that time 
when these auctions initially failed  higher interest rates for many of the securities went into effect 
of the total auction rate securities we held at july   the underlying assets of million or were student loans which are guaranteed by the us department of education and million or were rated aaa aaa by the major credit rating agencies 
we estimated the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities we held at july  based on valuation reports from third parties and a discounted cash flow model that we prepared 
using the valuation reports from third parties and our discounted cash flow model we determined that the fair values of the municipal auction rate securities we held at july  were substantially equal to their par values 
as a result  we recorded no decrease in the fair values of those securities for the twelve months then ended 
based on our ability and intent to hold these auction rate securities until liquidity returned to the market or they matured  we classified them as long term investments on our balance sheet at july  in august the broker dealers for our auction rate securities announced settlements under which they may provide liquidity solutions for  or purchase  the auction rate securities held by their institutional clients 
details of the agreements are still being finalized 
based on our expected operating cash flows and our other sources of cash  we do not believe that the reduction in liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs

we may decide to use cash and cash equivalents  investments  and our revolving line of credit facility to fund such activities in the future 
based on past performance and current expectations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet anticipated seasonal working capital needs  capital expenditure requirements  contractual obligations  commitments and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for at least the next months 
as discussed above in this item under auction rate securities  we do not believe that the reduction in the liquidity of our municipal auction rate securities will have a material impact on our overall ability to meet our liquidity needs

recent accounting pronouncements sfas  fair value measurements in september the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
this standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which means that it will be effective for our fiscal year beginning august  we are in the process of evaluating this standard and therefore have not yet determined the impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities in february the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the standard s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
the standard requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
it also requires companies to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
the new standard does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in sfas  fair value measurements  and sfas  disclosures about fair value of financial instruments

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment portfolio our investments consist of instruments that meet quality standards that are consistent with our investment policy 
this policy specifies that  except for direct obligations of the united states government  securities issued by agencies of the united states government  and money market funds  we diversify our investments by limiting our holdings with any individual issuer 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our portfolio of investments 
see note to the financial statements in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources  in item  and risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k for a description of market events that have affected the liquidity of certain municipal auction rate securities that we held at july  the following table presents our portfolio of cash equivalents and available for sale debt securities as of july  by stated maturity 
the table is classified by the original maturity date listed on the security and includes cash equivalents  which consist primarily of money market funds 
at july   the weighted average interest rate earned on our money market accounts was and the weighted average tax adjusted interest rate earned on our investments was 
years ending july  and in thousands thereafter total cash equivalents investments long term investments total interest rate risk our cash equivalents and investments are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and investments and the value of those investments 
should the federal reserve target rate increase by basis points from the level of july   the value of our investments would decline by approximately million 
should interest rates increase by basis points from the level of july   the value of our investments would decline by approximately million 
we are also exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates as they affect our million revolving credit facility 
advances under the credit facility accrue interest at rates that are equal to citibank s base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that ranges from to based on our senior debt credit ratings 
consequently  our interest expense would fluctuate with changes in the general level of these interest rates if we were to borrow any amounts under the credit facility 
at july   no amounts were outstanding under the credit facility 
on march  we issued million of senior unsecured notes due on march  and million of senior unsecured notes due on march  since these senior notes bear interest at fixed rates  they are not subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
impact of foreign currency rate changes the functional currencies of our international operating subsidiaries are the local currencies 
we translate the assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date 
we translate their revenue  costs and expenses at the average rates of exchange in effect during the period 
we include translation 
table of contents gains and losses in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheet 
we include net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions in interest and other income in our statements of operations 
since we translate foreign currencies primarily canadian dollars  british pounds and indian rupees into u 
s dollars for financial reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact on our financial results 
the historical impact of currency fluctuations has generally been immaterial 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is not significant primarily because our global subsidiaries invoice customers and satisfy their financial obligations almost exclusively in their local currencies 
although the impact of currency fluctuations on our financial results has generally been immaterial in the past and we believe that for the reasons cited above currency fluctuations will not be significant in the future  there can be no guarantee that the impact of currency fluctuations will not be material in the future 
as of july  we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
