item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this report 
market risk the primary objective of wesbanco s alco is to maximize net interest income within established policy parameters 
this objective is accomplished through the management of balance sheet composition  market risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions and liquidity risk 
market risk is defined as the risk of loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices 
management considers interest rate risk wesbanco s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
consistency of wesbanco s net interest income is largely dependent on effective management of interest rate risk 
as interest rates change in the market  rates earned on interest rate sensitive assets and rates paid on interest rate sensitive liabilities do not necessarily move concurrently 
differing rate sensitivities may arise because fixed rate assets and liabilities may not have the same maturities or because variable rate assets and liabilities differ in the timing and or the percentage of rate changes 
wesbanco s alco  comprised of senior management  monitors and manages interest rate risk within board approved policy limits 
interest rate risk is monitored primarily through the use of an earnings simulation model 
the model is highly dependent on assumptions  which change regularly as the balance sheet and interest rates change 
the key assumptions and strategies employed are analyzed bi monthly and reviewed by alco 
the earnings simulation model projects changes in net interest income resulting from the effect of changes in interest rates 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the earnings simulation model 
modeling changes in net interest income requires making certain assumptions regarding prepayment rates  callable bonds  and adjustments to non time deposit interest rates which may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
prepayment assumptions and adjustments to non time deposit rates at varying levels of interest rates are based primarily on historical experience and current market rates 
security portfolio maturities and prepayments are assumed to be reinvested in similar instruments and callable bond forecasts are adjusted at varying levels of interest rates 
while we believe such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates  callable bond forecasts and non time deposit rate changes will approximate actual future results 
moreover  the net interest income sensitivity chart presented in table  net interest income sensitivity  assumes the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of the period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration of the maturity or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
since the assumptions used in modeling changes in interest rates are uncertain  the simulation analysis should not be relied upon as being indicative of actual results 
the analysis may not consider all actions that wesbanco could employ in response to changes in interest rates 
management is aware of the significant effect inflation has on interest rates and can have on financial performance 
wesbanco s ability to cope with this is best determined by analyzing its capability to respond to changing interest rates and its ability to manage noninterest income and expense 
wesbanco monitors its mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities through alco in order to reduce the impact of inflation on net interest income 
management also controls the effects of inflation by reviewing the prices of its products and services  by introducing new products and services and by controlling overhead expenses 
interest rate risk policy limits are determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a twelve month period assuming an immediate and sustained basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates compared to a stable rate or base model 
wesbanco s current policy limits this exposure to of net interest income from the base model for a twelve month period 
table  net interest income sensitivity  shows wesbanco s interest rate sensitivity at december  and december  assuming both a and basis point interest rate change  compared to a base model 
table net interest income sensitivity immediate change in interest rates basis points percentage change in net interest income from base over one year alco guidelines december  december  n a n a throughout most of the first three quarters of  the yield curve was relatively flat or somewhat inverted  particularly between short term funding rates and longer term rates for investments and loans  causing many banks to experience lower net interest margins 
in mid third quarter  rate expectations began to change to a lower interest rate environment  due to market conditions and liquidity concerns in the sub prime and collateralized debt instrument markets 
for the remainder of the third quarter and throughout the fourth quarter  the federal reserve bank provided liquidity to the markets and lowered the benchmark federal funds rate charged between banks and the discount rate charged to banks  resulting in these rates ending the year at and  respectively  from and before the rate cuts 
rates have continued to drop early in the first quarter of  and they are expected by economists to drop further this spring primarily in the short end of the curve 
a widening of the curve between short and longer term interest rates has resulted  and due to wesbanco s liability sensitive balance sheet  the alco committee expects these lower rates should result in lower overall funding costs 
in fact  while wesbanco experienced a declining margin during the second and third quarters of  the margin was slightly improved in the fourth quarter due primarily to decreased short term funding costs 
the earnings simulation model currently projects that net interest income for the next twelve month period would increase by and if interest rates were to fall immediately by and basis points  respectively 
net interest income would decrease by and if rates increased by and basis points 
the increase in liability sensitivity between december  and december  was a result of changes in balance sheet composition primarily as customers responded to higher short term certificate of deposit and money market interest rates  and management s intentional strategy to enhance liability sensitivity in anticipation of further market interest rate decreases 
these changes favorably impacted wesbanco s sensitivity to falling interest rates  which the alco believes is more probable than an increase in rates in for at least the first half of wesbanco is slightly above its alco guidelines for a bp immediate rate increase in interest rates  however  management believes such position will be beneficial to the margin in the short run 
early in  based upon this higher rate sensitivity and current lower interest rates  wesbanco took action to reduce its short term borrowings by extending maturities as well as decreasing short term money market and certificate of deposit rates to capture improvement in the margin 
as an alternative to the immediate rate shock analysis  the alco monitors interest rate risk by ramping or increasing interest rates basis points gradually over a twelve month period 
wesbanco s current policy limits this exposure to of net interest income from the base model for a twelve month period 
management believes that the ramping analysis reflects a more realistic movement of interest rates  whereas the immediate rate shock reflects a worst case scenario 
the simulation model using the basis point increasing rate ramp analysis projects that net interest income would decrease over the next twelve months  compared to a decrease at december  wesbanco also periodically measures the economic value of equity  which is defined as the market value of equity in various increasing and decreasing rate scenarios 
at december   the market value of equity as a percent of base in a basis point rising rate environment would decrease  and it would decrease in a basis point falling rate environment 
wesbanco s policy is to limit such change to minus for a basis point change in interest rates 
wesbanco s alco evaluates various strategies to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
these strategies for the latter half of emphasized increasing liability sensitivity in anticipation of falling interest rates  which are projected to continue into the first half of among the strategies that are evaluated from time to time are extending borrowing terms with the fhlb and structuring repurchase agreements with terms providing some protection for future rate increases while minimizing current period rates paid  managing the level of wesbanco s fixed rate residential real estate loans maintained in the loan portfolio versus selling them in the secondary market  purchasing or originating adjustable rate loans  remixing of the loan portfolio as residential mortgages paydown into shorter lived  higher yielding commercial loans  offering special maturity  competitively priced short term certificates of deposit to offset runoff in money market deposit accounts  and in certain markets  regionally pricing certain deposit types to increase sales volume 
other strategies include emphasizing marketing programs to grow lower cost or non interest bearing transaction accounts  and using the cdars program and structured repurchase agreements as alternative wholesale borrowing sources 
the potential use of interest rate swap agreements to match fund certain long term commercial loans or as a fair value or cash flow hedge against certain asset and liability types  and using investment security cash flows to fund realized loan growth or to pay down short term borrowings are also evaluated as potential strategies by alco
