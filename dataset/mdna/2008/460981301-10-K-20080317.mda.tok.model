overview we have three reportable segments 
our consumer products and services segment includes our consumer protection and other consumer products and services 
our background screening segment includes the personnel and vendor background screening services provided by screening international 
our other segment includes management software solutions for the bail bonds industry provided by captira analytical  llc and corporate identity theft protection services offered by net enforcers  inc the components of our other segment were acquired in the latter part of consumer products and services we offer consumers a variety of consumer protection services and other consumer products and services primarily on a subscription basis 
our services help consumers protect themselves against identity theft or fraud and understand and monitor their credit profiles and other personal information 
through our subsidiary intersections insurance services  we offer a portfolio of services to include consumer discounts on healthcare  home  and auto related expenses  access to professional financial and legal information  and life  accidental death and disability insurance products 
our consumer services are offered through relationships with clients  including many of the largest financial institutions in the united states and canada  and clients in other industries 
we also offer our services directly to consumers 
we also offer data security breach services to organizations responding to compromises of sensitive personal information 
we help these clients notify the affected individuals and we provide the affected individuals with identity theft recovery and credit monitoring services offered by our clients at no charge to the affected individuals 
we generally are paid fees by the clients for the services we provide their customers 
our products and services are marketed to customers of our clients  and often are branded and tailored to meet our clients specifications 
our clients are principally credit card  direct deposit or mortgage issuing financial institutions  including many of the largest financial institutions in the united states and canada 
with certain of our financial institution clients  we have broadened our marketing efforts to access demand deposit accounts and selling at the point of personal contact in branches 
our financial institution clients currently account for the majority of our existing subscriber base 
we also are continuing to augment our client base through relationships with insurance companies  mortgage companies  brokerage companies  associations  travel companies  retail companies  web and technology companies and other service providers with significant market presence and brand loyalty 
with our clients  our services are marketed to potential subscribers through a variety of marketing channels  including direct mail  outbound telemarketing  inbound telemarketing  inbound customer service and account activation calls  email  mass media and the internet 
our marketing arrangements with our clients sometimes call for us to fund and manage marketing activity 
the mix between our company funded and client funded marketing programs varies from year to year based upon our and our clients strategies 
in  we substantially increased our own investment in marketing with one or more clients  and anticipate this increased investment continuing over the next months 

table of contents in we expanded our efforts to market our consumer products and services directly to consumers 
we conduct our consumer direct marketing primarily through the internet 
we also may market through other channels  including direct mail  outbound telemarketing  inbound telemarketing  email and mass media 
we expect to continue making an investment in marketing direct to consumers in our client arrangements are distinguished from one another by the allocation between us and the client of the economic risk and reward of the marketing campaigns 
the general characteristics of each arrangement are described below  although the arrangements with particular clients may contain unique characteristics direct marketing arrangements under direct marketing arrangements  we bear most of the new subscriber marketing costs and pay our client a commission for revenue derived from subscribers 
these arrangements generally result in negative cash flow over the first several months after a program is launched due to the upfront nature of the marketing investments 
in some arrangements we pay the client a service fee for access to the client s customers or billing of the subscribers by the client 
indirect marketing arrangements under indirect marketing arrangements  our client bears the marketing expense and pays us a service fee or percentage of the revenue 
because the subscriber acquisition cost is borne by our client under these arrangements  our revenue per subscriber is typically lower than that under direct marketing arrangements 
indirect marketing arrangements generally provide positive cash flow earlier than direct arrangements and the ability to obtain subscribers and utilize marketing channels that the clients otherwise may not make available 
shared marketing arrangements under shared marketing arrangements  marketing expenses are shared by us and the client in various proportions  and we may pay a commission to or receive a service fee from the client 
revenue generally is split in proportion to the investment made by our client and us 
the classification of a client relationship as direct  indirect or shared is based on whether we or the client pay the marketing expenses 
our accounting policies for revenue recognition  however  are not based on the classification of a client arrangement as direct  indirect or shared 
we look to the specific client arrangement to determine the appropriate revenue recognition policy  as discussed in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our typical contracts for direct marketing arrangements  and some indirect and shared marketing arrangements  provide that after termination of the contract we may continue to provide our services to existing subscribers  for periods ranging from two years to no specific termination period  under the economic arrangements that existed at the time of termination 
under certain of our agreements  however  including most indirect marketing arrangements and some shared marketing arrangements  the clients may require us to cease providing services under existing subscriptions 
clients under some contracts may also require us to cease providing services to their customers under existing subscriptions if the contract is terminated for material breach by us 
as shown in the following table  the number of subscribers from our indirect  direct and shared marketing arrangements  have increased over the past three fiscal years as of december  indirect marketing arrangements direct and shared marketing arrangements total subscribers subscribers in our consumer products and services segment from indirect marketing arrangements were as of december  and of total subscribers as of december  through our increased direct marketing efforts in  our subscribers from indirect marketing arrangements has decreased to as of december  the number of cancellations within the first days as a percentage of new subscribers was in  in and in the number of cancellations within the first days of subscription  as a percentage of new subscribers was higher during the year ended december  compared to the same period last year 
we analyze subscriber cancellations during the first days because we believe this time period affords 
table of contents the subscriber the opportunity to evaluate the service 
the number of cancellations after the first days  which are measured as a percentage of the number of subscribers at the beginning of the year plus new subscribers during the year less cancellations within the first days  was in  in and in the total number of cancellations during the year as a percentage of the beginning of the year subscribers plus new subscriber additions  was in and and in conversely  our retention rates  calculated by taking subscribers at the end of the year divided by subscribers at the beginning of the year plus additions for the year  decreased from in and to in the retention rate decreased in primarily due to a significant increase in the rate of credit card declines in the fourth quarter of at one of our clients due to changes to the manner in which the client administers third party products 
we cancelled service to these affected subscribers in  which had an impact on our retention rate for the year ended december  revenue from subscribers obtained through our largest clients in  and as a percentage of total revenue  and the principal contract arrangements with those clients  were as follows percentage of revenue for the years ended december  client relationship american express shared marketing discover direct marketing discover indirect marketing capital one direct and through equifax agreement indirect marketing citibank direct marketing citibank indirect marketing bank of america includes mbna shared direct marketing our relationship with american express travel related services  or american express  was a shared marketing arrangement under an agreement that expired on december  under a services transition agreement with american express  we provided our current consumer services through may   to subscribers who paid for the service through their amex credit cards 
we were compensated for those services through april   based on the commission structure in effect under the existing agreement with american express  and from may   to may   based on a service fee per subscriber 
we have not serviced those subscribers since may  the services transition agreement also provided that we maintain the perpetual and unrestricted right to provide our services to all subscribers who are currently paying for the consumer services through payment vehicles other than american express credit cards  and to all subscribers who are receiving our combined personal and business credit information services regardless of how those subscribers are billed 
we have not been required to pay any commission on those subscribers since january  we will have the right to offer our other products and services to those subscribers  and the services transition agreement prohibits either party from knowingly soliciting subscribers retained by the other party under the agreement 
as a result of the services transition agreement  since may   we ceased servicing approximately of our subscribers obtained through american express  which accounts for approximately of the revenue generated through the american express relationship 
american express also reimbursed us in the amount of one million dollars  for certain marketing expenses incurred in on february   we received written notice from our client discover that  effective september   it was terminating the agreement for services administration between us and discover dated march   as amended the services agreement  including the omnibus amendment dated december  the omnibus amendment 
on the same date  we filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the circuit court for fairfax county  virginia 
the complaint seeks a declaration that  if discover uses for its own purposes credit report authorizations given by customers to intersections or discover  it will be in breach of the services agreement and omnibus amendment to the services agreement 
intersections contends that discover or its new credit monitoring service provider must obtain new authorizations from the customers in order to provide credit 
table of contents monitoring services to them 
in the complaint  intersections alleges that reliance on the credit report authorizations by discover or its new provider would be a breach of the services agreement and omnibus amendment thereto  and thus seeks a declaratory judgment to prevent discover from committing a breach of the parties contract 
in november  we entered into a master services agreement with equifax under which we provided various services 
we recently amended the master agreement to continue the term to november  even if the master agreement is not terminated  however  either party may terminate the receipt of particular services from the other party on days prior notice 
with the exception of services to capital one customers acquired prior to january   we are not providing any services under that agreement 
prior to january   we provided our identity theft protection and credit management services under the master agreement with equifax to customers of capital one bank  or capital one  which marketed those services to consumers under an agreement between capital one and equifax 
on september   we entered into a marketing and services agreement with capital one under which  effective january   our services are marketed by capital one to its customers 
the services marketed to capital one customers under this agreement are substantially all of the services previously marketed through the master agreement between us and equifax  in addition to other services 
through our agreement with equifax  however  we continue to provide our services to the customers of capital one who enrolled for the services prior to january  some of our top revenue producing clients have re negotiated pricing with us over the last few months 
although some of these efforts resulted in lower prices for some products  we expect that increasing volumes and changing of the sales mix to higher priced products will provide continued growth with these clients 
background screening through our majority owned subsidiary  screening international  llc  we provide a variety of risk management tools for the purpose of personnel and vendor background screening services  including criminal background checks  driving records  employment verification and reference checks  drug testing and credit history checks to businesses worldwide 
our background screening services integrate data from various automated sources throughout the world  additional manual research findings from employees and subcontractors  and internal business logic provided by both screening international and by our clients into reports that assist in decision making 
our background screening services are generally sold to corporate clients under contractual arrangements with individual per unit prices for specific service specifications 
due to substantial difference in both service specifications and associated data acquisition costs  prices for our background screening services vary significantly among clients and geographies 
our clients include leading us  uk and global companies in such areas as manufacturing  healthcare  telecommunications and financial services 
our clients are primarily located in the united states and the united kingdom 
several of our clients have operations in other countries  and use our services in connection with those operations 
we have other clients in various countries  and expect the number of these clients to increase as we develop our global background screening business 
because we currently service the majority of our clients through our operations in the us and the uk  we consider those two locations to be the sources of our business for purposes of allocating revenue on a geographic basis 
we have several clients that contribute greater than of this segment s revenue 
the loss of one of these clients could have a material adverse impact on this segment s financial results 
revenue through our largest client in and was and of the segment s revenue 
none of these clients constitutes or more of our consolidated revenue 
we generally market our background screening services to businesses through an internal sales force 
our services are offered to businesses on a local or global basis 
prices for our services vary based upon complexity of the services offered  the cost of performing these services and competitive factors 
control risks group provides marketing assistance and services  and licenses certain trademarks to screening international under which our services are branded in certain geographic areas 
other through our wholly owned subsidiary  captira analytical  we provide automated service solutions for the bail bonds industry 
these services include accounting  reporting  and decision making tools which allow bail 
table of contents bondsmen  general agents and sureties to run their offices more efficiently  to exercise greater operational and financial control over their businesses  and to make better underwriting 
we believe captira analytical s services are the only fully integrated suite of bail bonds management applications of comparable scope available in the marketplace today 
captira analytical s services are sold to retail bail bondsman on a per seat license basis plus additional one time or transaction related charges for various optional services 
as captira analytical s business model is relatively new  pricing and service configurations are subject to change at any time

prices for our services vary based upon the specific configuration of services purchased by each client and range from several hundred dollars per month to thousands of dollars per month 
the pro forma impact of captira  hide n seek or net enforcers on our historical operating results is not material 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
the application of our critical accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgments by us 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations

annual subscriptions include subscribers with full refund provisions at any time during the subscription period and pro rata refund provisions 
revenue related to annual subscription with full refund provisions is recognized on the expiration of these refund provisions 
revenue related to annual subscribers with pro rata provisions is recognized based on a pro rata share of revenue earned 
an allowance for discretionary subscription refunds is established based on our actual cancellation experience 
we also provide services for which certain financial institution clients are the primary obligors directly to their customers 
revenue from these arrangements is recognized when earned  which is at the time we provide the service  generally on a monthly basis 
in addition  we generate revenue from the sale of one time credit reports and background screens  which is generally at the time of completion 
the amount of revenue recorded by us is determined in accordance with financial accounting standards board s fasb emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  which addresses whether a company should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to a customer or the net amount retained by us amount billed less commissions or fees paid 
we generally record revenue on a gross basis in the amount that we bill the subscriber when our arrangements with financial institution clients provide for us to serve as the primary obligor in the transaction  we have latitude in establishing price and we bear the risk of physical loss of inventory and credit risk for the amount billed to the subscriber 
we generally record revenue in the amount that we bill our financial institution clients  and not the amount billed to their customers  when our financial institution client is the primary obligor  establishes price to the customer and bears the credit risk

deferred subscription solicitation and commission costs deferred subscription solicitation and commission costs include direct response marketing costs and deferred commissions 
our deferred subscription solicitation costs consist of subscription acquisition costs  including telemarketing  web based marketing expenses and direct mail such as printing and postage 
telemarketing  web based marketing and direct mail expenses are direct response advertising costs  which are accounted for in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  reporting on advertising costs sop 
the recoverability of amounts capitalized as deferred subscription solicitation costs are evaluated at each balance sheet date  in accordance with sop  by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets on a cost pool basis to the probable remaining future benefit expected to result directly from such advertising costs 
probable remaining future benefit is estimated based upon historical subscriber patterns  and represents net revenues less costs to earn those revenues 
in estimating probable future benefit on a per subscriber basis we deduct our contractual cost to service that subscriber from the known sales price 
we then apply the future benefit on a per subscriber basis to the number of subscribers expected to be retained in the future to arrive at the total probable future benefit 
in estimating the number of subscribers we will retain ie  factoring in expected cancellations  we utilize historical subscriber patterns maintained by us that show attrition rates by client  product and marketing channel 
the total probable future benefit is then compared to the costs of a given marketing campaign ie  cost pools  and if the probable future benefit exceeds the cost pool  the amount is considered to be recoverable 
if direct response advertising costs were to exceed the estimated probable remaining future benefit  an adjustment would be made to the deferred subscription costs to the extent of any shortfall 
we amortize deferred subscription solicitation costs on a cost pool basis over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received  but no more than months 
in accordance with sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
 commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with full refund provisions and monthly subscriptions are expensed in the month incurred  unless we are entitled to a refund of the commissions 
if annual subscriptions are cancelled prior to their initial terms  we are generally entitled to a full refund of the previously paid commission for those annual subscriptions with a full refund provision and a pro rata refund  equal to the unused portion of their subscription  for those annual subscriptions with a pro rata refund provision 
commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with full commission refund provisions are deferred until the earlier of expiration of the refund privileges or cancellation 
once the refund privileges have expired  the commission costs are recognized ratably in the same pattern that the related revenue is recognized 
commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with pro rata refund provisions are deferred and charged to operations as the corresponding revenue is recognized 
if a subscription is cancelled  upon receipt of the refunded commission from our client  we record a reduction to the deferred commission 
we have prepaid commission agreements with some of our clients 
under these agreements  we pay a commission on new subscribers in lieu of ongoing commission payments 
we amortize these prepaid commissions  on an accelerated basis  over a period of time not to exceed three years  which is the average expected life of customers 
the prepaid commissions are shown in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
amortization is included in commissions expense on our consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents software development costs we develop software for internal use and capitalize software development costs incurred during the application development stage in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and eitf  accounting for web site development cost

on the same date  we filed a complaint for declaratory judgment in the circuit court for fairfax county  virginia 
the complaint seeks a declaration that  if discover uses for its own purposes credit report authorizations given by customers to intersections or discover  it will be in breach of the services agreement and omnibus amendment to the services agreement 
intersections contends that discover or its new credit monitoring service provider must obtain new authorizations from the customers in order to provide credit monitoring services to them 
in the complaint  intersections alleges that  under the omnibus amendment to the services agreement  the authorizations given by customers to intersections or discover were obtained solely on behalf of intersections  for the sole purpose of enabling intersections to provide its credit monitoring services 
intersections further alleges that discover has stated that its new credit monitoring provider will rely on the authorizations given to intersections and not obtain new authorizations 
intersections alleges that reliance on the credit report authorizations by discover or its new provider would be a breach of the services agreement and omnibus amendment thereto  and thus seeks a declaratory judgment to prevent discover from committing a breach of the parties contract
