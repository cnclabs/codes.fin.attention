overview we are an integrated wholesale coffee roaster and dealer in the united states and one of the few coffee companies that offers a broad array of coffee products across the entire spectrum of consumer tastes  preferences and price points 
as a result  we believe that we are well positioned to increase our profitability and endure potential coffee price volatility throughout varying cycles of the coffee market and economic conditions 
our operations have primarily focused on the following areas of the coffee industry the sale of wholesale specialty green coffee  the roasting  blending  packaging and sale of private label coffee  and the roasting  blending  packaging and sale of our seven brands of coffee 
our operating results are affected by a number of factors including the level of marketing and pricing competition from existing or new competitors in the coffee industry  our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers  fluctuations in purchase prices and supply of green coffee and in the selling prices of our products  and our ability to manage inventory and fulfillment operations and maintain gross margins 
our net sales are driven primarily by the success of our sales and marketing efforts and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers 
for this reason  we have made the strategic decision to invest in measures that will increase net sales 
in february  we acquired certain assets of premier roasters  including equipment and a roasting facility in la junta  colorado 
we also hired a west coast brand manager to market our s w brand and to increase sales of s w coffee to new customers 
in april  we entered into a joint venture with caruso s coffee of brecksville  ohio and formed generations coffee company  llc  a delaware limited liability company  which will engage in the roasting  packaging and sale of private label specialty coffee products 
we own of the joint venture and are the exclusive supplier of its coffee inventory 
we believe that the generations coffee joint venture will allow us to bid on the private label gourmet whole bean business we have not been equipped to pursue from an operational standpoint in the past 
with this specialty roasting facility in place  in many cases right in the backyard of our most important wholesale and retail customers  we believe that we are in an ideal position to combine our current canned private label business with high end private label specialty whole bean business 
high end specialty whole bean coffee sells for as much as three times more per pound than the canned coffees in which we currently specialize 
as a result of these efforts  net sales increased in our specialty green coffee  private label and branded coffee business lines in both dollars and pounds sold 
in addition  we increased the number of our customers in all three areas 
in july  we entered into a three year licensing agreement with entenmann s products  inc  a subsidiary of entenmann s  inc  which is one of the nation s oldest baking companies 
the agreement gives us the exclusive rights to manufacture  market and distribute a full line of entenmann s brand coffee products throughout the united states 
we anticipate rolling out these items to our customers in we expect to develop not only mainstream entenmann s coffee items  but upscale flavored entenmann s products in twelve ounce valve bags as well 
these products will give the line a visible upscale image to our retailers and their customers  which we believe will be integral to the long term success of this arrangement 
our net sales are affected by the price of green coffee 
we import green coffee from colombia  mexico  kenya  brazil and uganda 
the supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control 
for example  coffee crops in brazil  which produces one third of the world s green coffee  are susceptible to frost in june and july and drought in september  october and november 
however  because we purchase coffee from a number of countries and are able to freely substitute one country s coffee for another in our products  price fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material impact on the price we pay for coffee 
accordingly  price fluctuations in one country generally have not had a material effect on our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources 
historically  because we generally have been able to pass green coffee price increases through to customers  increased prices of green coffee generally result in increased net sales 
however  the average indicator price for robusta coffee  the main component for our leading espresso brands caf caribe and caf supremo  is still at its highest level seen in the last eight years 
in october  national brands reacted to these price increases  raising list prices by per unit  and we were able to increase our prices as well 
in addition  we initiated another price increase in january of per pound on most roasted products and an additional price increase of per pound in late fiscal which will take effect in fiscal historically  we have used short term coffee futures and options contracts primarily for the purpose of partially hedging and minimizing the effects of changing green coffee prices and to reduce our cost of sales 
in addition  we acquire futures contracts with longer terms  generally three to four months  primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee at favorable prices 
although the use of these derivative financial instruments has enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices  no strategy can entirely eliminate pricing risks and we generally remain exposed to loss when prices decline significantly in a short period of time 
in addition  we generally remain exposed to supply risk in the event of non performance by the counter parties to any futures contracts 
if the hedges that we enter do not adequately offset the risks of coffee bean price volatility or our hedges result in losses  our cost of sales may increase  resulting in a decrease in profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  income taxes and loss contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  may be impacted significantly by judgment  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab 
under sab  revenue is recognized at the point of passage to the customer of title and risk of loss  when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment 
sales are reflected net of discounts and returns 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to provide for losses arising from customers inability to make required payments 
if there is deterioration of our customers credit worthiness and or there is an increase in the length of time that the receivables are past due greater than the historical assumptions used  additional allowances may be required 
for example  every additional one percent of our accounts receivable that becomes uncollectible  would reduce our operating income by approximately  inventories are stated at cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
based on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions  inventories are subject to be written down to market value 
if our assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
each additional one percent of potential inventory writedown would have reduced operating income by approximately  for the year ended october  we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reflected on the balance sheet when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized 
accordingly  our net deferred tax asset as of october  of  could need to be written off if we do not remain profitable 
year ended october  fiscal compared to the year ended october  fiscal net income 
net income increased  or  to  or 
per share basic and diluted for the year ended october  compared to  or 
per share basic and diluted for the year ended october  the increase in net income primarily reflects increased net sales  partially offset by increased cost of sales and increased operating expenses 
net sales 
net sales totaled  for the year ended october   an increase of  or from  for the year ended october  the increase in net sales reflects a increase in coffee pounds sold from million pounds in to million pounds in the increase in pounds of coffee sold is the result of increased sales of our branded and specialty green coffees 
sales of our flagship hispanic espresso brands  caf caribe and caf supremo  increased once again 
the number of our customers in the specialty green coffee area grew approximately to customers 
these customers are predominately independent gourmet specialty roasters  some of whom own their own retail outlets 
sales to new customers in this area historically start slowly because many of these companies are start up ventures 
because the specialty green coffee area is the fastest growing segment of the coffee market  we believe that our customer base and sales will grow in this area 
higher coffee prices during also contributed to the increase in net sales 
cost of sales 
cost of sales for the year ended october  was  or of net sales  as compared to  or of net sales for the year ended october  cost of sales consists primarily of the cost of green coffee and packaging materials and realized and unrealized gains or losses on hedging activity 
the increase in cost of sales reflects higher packaging costs of approximately million associated with the increase in net sales and increased purchases of green coffee in the amount of approximately million 
the increase in green coffee purchases resulted from increased pounds sold and higher green coffee prices during as compared to fiscal was a year of increased prices and volatility in the green coffee markets  especially the london robusta market which accounts for approximately one third of our coffee purchases 
the average indicator price for robusta coffee  the main component for our leading espresso brands caf caribe and caf supremo  increased approximately year to year  trading to their highest levels in nine years 
despite operating in this challenging environment  we were able to keep our margins relatively stable due to price increases we implemented on our products during october and january and the success of our hedging activities 
our price increases allowed us to pass much of the increase in the cost of green coffee that occurred during along to our customers 
net gains on futures contracts increased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the success of our hedging activities was a primary reason that our cost of sales remained flat  despite the challenging environment in the coffee markets 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended october  was  an increase of  from  for the year ended october  gross profit as a percentage of net sales remained relatively unchanged at for the year ended october  compared to for the year ended october  operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased  or to  for the year ended october  from  for the fiscal year ended october  due to increases in selling and administrative expenses and a  write down in amounts due from our caf la rica joint venture which was dissolved in october after settlement of the litigation 
in consideration for the dismissal with prejudice of all defendants to the litigation and the release of all claims and counterclaims  caf la rica paid  in cash to coffee holding and returned to coffee holding the brick pack machine originally contributed to caf la rica by coffee holding 
selling and administrative expenses increased  or to  for the year ended october  from  for the increase in selling and administrative expenses reflects several factors  including increases of approximately  in office salaries   in professional fees   in commissions and  in utilities  partially offset by decreases of  in contract labor and  in advertising and promotion 
the increase in office salaries was due to additional sales personnel and support staff 
the increase in professional fees was due to the requirements of implementing our compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and the cost of the now settled litigation with caf la rica 
the increase in commissions was due to increased sales and the increase in utilities was due to higher energy costs 
the decrease in contract labor resulted from the reduced need for information technology specialists  as our information technology work was performed in house 
advertising and promotion costs decreased as a result of reduced allowances to customers which resulted in reduced chargebacks 
other expense 
other expense increased  or from  for the year ended october  to  for the year ended october  the increase was attributable to a  decrease in other income  a  write down of our investment in the caf la rica joint venture and a decrease of  in management fee income earned from providing administrative services to caf la rica 
other income in reflected insurance proceeds received on coffee inventory lost in our new orleans warehouse in hurricane katrina 
income before taxes and minority interest in subsidiary

net income decreased  or  to  or 
per share basic and diluted for the year ended october  compared to  or 
per share basic and diluted for the year ended october  the decrease in net income primarily reflects increased cost of sales and operating expenses and a loss by our caf la rica joint venture  partially offset by increased net sales

the increase in green coffee purchases resulted from increased pounds sold and higher green coffee prices during the period as prices increased per pound on the new york arabica market and per pound on the london robusta market year to year 
the average indicator price for robusta coffee  the main component for our leading espresso brands caf caribe and caf supremo  increased by august compared to august of this indicator price was the highest seen in the last seven years as measured by the international coffee organization 
by september  prices had achieved further gains  trading to their highest levels in eight years 
for competitive reasons  we were not able to pass these price increases through to our customers 
as a result  these increases had the effect of diminishing our profit margins significantly on our leading espresso lines as there were no lower priced coffees to substitute into our blends 
in addition  our private label margins were negatively impacted as well  but to a much lesser degree  as robustas represent only a small percentage of our private label blends 
in october  national brands reacted to these price increases  raising list prices by per unit 
we increased our prices as well 
gross profit

officers salaries increased  to  for the year ended october  from  for the year ended october  the increase was mainly due to a fiscal year bonus paid to our president and chief executive officer and was partially offset by a  reduction in his annual salary effective in august of other income and expense 
other expense increased  or from  for the year ended october  to  for the year ended october  the increase was attributable a loss in the initial year of our caf la rica joint venture of  and an increase in interest expense of  the increase was partially offset by an increase in interest income of  a  increase in other income and  in management fee income earned from providing administrative services to the caf la rica joint venture

in addition  if we default under our existing credit facility or if our lender demands payment of a portion or all of our indebtedness  we may not have sufficient funds to make such payments

our line of credit was amended in october and currently provides for a maximum of  expires on october  and requires monthly interest payments at a rate of libor plus 
this loan is secured by a blanket lien on all of our assets 
commodity price risks 
the supply and price of coffee beans are subject to volatility and are influenced by numerous factors which are beyond our control 
historically  we have used short term coffee futures and options contracts generally with terms of two months or less primarily for the purpose of partially hedging and minimizing the effects of changing green coffee prices  as further explained in note of the notes to financial statements in this report 
in addition  during the latter half of fiscal  we began to acquire futures contracts with longer terms generally three to four months primarily for the purpose of guaranteeing an adequate supply of green coffee 
the use of these derivative financial instruments has enabled us to mitigate the effect of changing prices although we generally remain exposed to loss when prices decline significantly in a short period of time and remain at higher levels  preventing us from obtaining inventory at favorable prices 
we generally have been able to pass green coffee price increases through to customers  thereby maintaining our gross profits 
however  we cannot predict whether we will be able to pass inventory price increases through to our customers in the future 
we believe our hedging policies remain a vital element to our business model not only in controlling our cost of sales  but also giving us the flexibility to obtain the inventory necessary to continue to grow our sales while minimizing margin compression during a time of historically high coffee prices 
at october   we held future contracts for the purchase of  pounds of coffee at an average price of per pound 
the market price of coffee applicable to such contracts was per pound at october  at october   we did not hold any options
