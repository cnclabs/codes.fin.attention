sales price increases to recover increased material costs and the effects of foreign currency translation also contributed to the improvement in net sales 
the most significant sales volume increases were realized in the irrigation and engineered support structures ess segments 
in april  we completed the acquisition of of the shares of tehomet oy tehomet  a manufacturer of lighting structures in finland 
the operations of tehomet were included in our financial statements starting at the date of acquisition 
the improvement in gross profit margin gross profit as a percent of sales in over was mainly due to improved factory performance associated with higher volumes and higher average sales prices combined with moderating raw material prices 
selling  general and administrative sg a spending in increased over levels by approximately million 
this increase was mainly due to higher employee incentives related to improved operating performance approximately million  increased salary and employee benefit costs approximately million  higher sales commissions associated with the increased sales volumes approximately million and the effects of foreign currency translations approximately million 
the decrease in net interest expense in  as compared with  was primarily due to higher interest income associated with increased interest bearing cash investments that resulted from our positive cash flow in average borrowing levels in were slightly lower than  which resulted from operating cash inflows that were used to pay down our interest bearing debt  offset to a degree by the debt that was incurred to finance the tehomet acquisition 
our effective tax rate in  while comparable to  was affected by a number of significant items 
in  we recorded million in income tax valuation allowances that related to our net operating loss and asset tax carryforwards in our mexican subsidiary 
in the fourth quarter of  mexico enacted a tax law change that effectively instituted a minimum tax on corporations  including those with net operating loss carryforwards 
we determined that it was necessary to reduce the recorded value of these net operating loss carryforwards in our financial statements 
this was offset by approximately million in certain unrecognized income tax benefits related to activities in prior tax years that were recorded as a reduction in income tax expense in in the third quarter of  due to the expirations of united states statutes of limitation 
we had previously determined that these tax benefits were not likely to be realized and therefore had not recognized these benefits in prior years 
in  china enacted a change in its income tax law that was intended to harmonize income tax rates for all companies operating in china 
as a result  we revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the new income tax rates  resulting in a million decrease in income tax expense in our income tax rate in was also favorably impacted by stronger earnings in our international operations 
these locations outside the united states generally have lower statutory income tax rates than the us  contributing to a slightly overall lower effective income tax rate in as compared with miscellaneous income in was lower than  due mainly to a million settlement associated with a retirement plan of a former subsidiary in the first quarter of our share of the profits in our nonconsolidated subsidiaries in improved over the most significant reason for the improvement was losses incurred in our owned structures operation in mexico in in the fourth quarter of  we purchased the remaining of this subsidiary from the majority owner 
our cash flows provided by operations were million in  as compared with million in the higher operating cash flows in resulted from improved net earnings in and the timing of income tax payments 
this improvement was offset to a degree by higher working capital associated with higher overall business levels in as compared with and distributions made from our nonqualified deferred compensation plan in in  our capital expenditures were million  as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the increased capital spending in was mainly due to manufacturing capacity expansions in the ess and utility support structures segments 
engineered support structures ess segment general the sales increase in the ess segment in  as compared with  was the result of improved sales volumes in all geographic regions 
the sales increase was mainly due to improved sales volumes  the impact of foreign currency translation approximately million and the tehomet acquisition that was completed in april million 
on a product line basis  sales improved in all of the major product lines in  as compared with gross profit increased at a slightly lower rate than sales  mainly as a result of steel and other raw material price increases in china that were not recoverable in the form of higher sales prices 
in addition  changes in tax laws enacted in china in limited our ability to recover value added taxes on our sales to customers outside of china added to our costs and reduced gross profit margins 
the most significant reasons for the increase in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in  as compared with  was currency translation million  increased sales commissions due to increased sales volumes million  the impact of the tehomet acquisition million and increased employee salary and benefit costs million 
the improvement in segment profitability in  as compared with  was also due to approximately million in severance and equipment disposal costs incurred in europe in lighting and traffic products in north america  lighting and traffic structure sales in increased modestly over levels 
in the transportation lighting market  sales were comparable in  as compared with this market is largely funded through us federal highway legislation and spending by the various states on road construction and improvement projects 
in  there were some delays in federal funding appropriations for road and highway projects  which we believe contributed to sluggishness in orders and shipments 
in addition  some budget weakness in certain states also caused some road and highway projects to be delayed 
these factors  we believe  contributed to some slowness in sales orders and shipments in  as compared with sales in the commercial lighting market channel increased in  as compared with  due primarily to improved orders from and expanding relationships with lighting fixture manufacturers 
in the international markets  sales of lighting structures in europe were higher in  as compared with this improvement was the result of good economic conditions in most of our key markets  especially france 
the improvement in lighting structure sales more than offset the effect of reduced tramway structure sales in europe in  as compared with lighting sales in europe were also enhanced by the tehomet acquisition 
lighting structure sales in china for were comparable with specialty products the increase in specialty structure sales in  as compared with  was due to strong sales of wireless communication structures in china 
the strong demand for wireless communication structures in china was due to the continuing development by wireless communication companies of their infrastructure to support the continuing growth and development of wireless voice and data communication in china 
in north america  the sales volume of wireless communication structures and components in was similar to sales of sign structures were lower in than  due in part to our decision in late to consolidate certain facilities that produce sign structures 
we believe that this action will help us better serve our markets and reduce operating costs in the future 
utility products this product line mainly includes that sale of utility structures outside of north america 
the main reason for the increased sales in this product line in  as compared with  was stronger sales of utility structures in china and various other international markets 
we expect sales of utility structures in china will grow in the future to support economic growth and china s efforts to develop its electrical energy infrastructure 
we also continue to experience opportunities to serve markets outside of china  using our chinese operations as a competitive way to serve these markets 
utility support structures segment in the utility support structures segment  the sales increase experienced in  as compared with  was the result of sales volumes improvement as well as improved sales prices 
we continue to experience strong sales order rates and backlogs in the business 
the electrical utility companies and independent power producers have continued their high level of infrastructure spending related to improving the quality  reliability and capacity of the electrical transmission grid 
gross profit increased at a greater rate than sales in  as compared with this improvement mainly was associated with an improved product sales mix  improved factory performance related in part to higher sales volumes  moderating material cost inflation and improved product pricing 
sg a expenses increased in  as compared with  due primarily to increased employee incentives due to improved operational performance million  higher employee salary and benefit costs to support the higher sales levels million and the consolidation of our mexico operation million 
coatings segment coatings segment sales in were above levels  mainly due to higher sales prices and increased demand for galvanizing services 
in our galvanizing operations  pounds of steel galvanized in increased over by approximately 
the volume increases were due to stronger industrial economic conditions in our market areas  including increased galvanizing services provided to our other operations in the us the increase in operating income in  as compared with  was due to higher production levels and improved production efficiencies  offset to a degree by a gain of million on the sale of one of our facilities in the third quarter of operating income in was affected by a valuation charge of approximately million related to the disposal of manufacturing equipment in our anodizing operation 
sg a spending in was comparable to irrigation segment for the fiscal year ended december   the sales increase in the irrigation segment  as compared with  was predominantly due to higher sales volumes 
in north america  historically high farm commodity prices and strong net farm income in resulted in improved demand for irrigation machines 
in addition  relatively dry growing conditions in contributed to increased after market parts sales in our major north american markets 
international sales increased in  as compared with  also due to higher farm commodity prices  which resulted in improved demand for irrigation machines 
on a regional basis  the sales improvement was broad based  as we experienced sales improvements in most geographic regions which more than offset sales weakness in brazil 
gross profit in the irrigation segment in  as compared with  increased at a higher rate than sales 
the strong sales demand in this segment resulted in better factory utilization and more than offset the effects of inflation in our raw material inputs 
the most significant factors resulting in the increase in sg a spending in  as compared with  were increased salary and benefit expense for additional administrative personnel to support the level of business million  increased employee incentives associated with improved operational performance million  and increased spending for new product development approximately million 
other this includes our tubing and industrial fastener operations  our machine tool accessories operation in france and the development costs associated with our wind energy structure initiative 
we made the decision to suspend our wind energy initiative in the fourth quarter of the main reasons for the improvement sales in  as compared with  were improved demand for industrial tubing especially for grain handling applications and improved demand for machine tool accessories in europe 
the improvement in operating income this year was related to the improvement in sales  a favorable sales mix in tubing and the impact of suspending our wind energy structure initiative 
the suspension of wind energy development resulted in approximately million less expense in  as compared with the machine tool accessories operation was sold in january net corporate expense the increase in net corporate expense in  as compared with  was mainly related to approximately million of increased employee incentives due to improved earnings and common stock price which is used to value certain long term management incentives 
fiscal compared with fiscal overview the sales increase in  as compared with  reflected improved sales volumes as well as sales price increases to recover increased material costs 
all reportable segments contributed to the sales volume increase  with the most significant increases being realized by the utility support structures  engineered support structures and irrigation segments 
the improvement in gross profit margin gross profit as a percent of sales in over was mainly due to stronger gross profit margins in the coatings segment 
the utility support structures and irrigation segments also recorded slightly higher gross profit margins 
selling  general and administrative sg a spending in increased over levels  mainly as a result of higher employee incentives related to improved operating performance approximately million  increased salary and employee benefit costs approximately million  higher sales commissions associated with the increased sales volumes approximately million and expense related to stock options approximately million that was required to be recorded under the provisions of sfas no 
r  which we adopted during the first quarter of we also incurred million more bad debt expense in  as compared with of this increase  million related to a reversal of bad debt provision for an international irrigation receivable in all reportable segments contributed to the increased operating income in  as compared with the decrease in net interest expense in  as compared with  was primarily due to lower average borrowing levels this year 
average borrowing levels in were approximately million lower than  which resulted from operating cash inflows that were used to pay down our interest bearing debt 
the impact of lower borrowing levels on interest expense were somewhat offset by higher interest rates on our variable rate debt 
the lower effective tax rate in  as compared with  was due in part to million in taxes incurred in due to repatriation of foreign earnings 
we realized approximately million in certain income tax benefits related to credits from prior tax years taken on our income tax returns in we had previously determined it was not probable that these tax benefits would be realized and therefore had not recognized these benefits in prior years 
in addition  we realized an increase in the amount of our pre tax earnings derived from foreign locations in  as compared with these foreign locations generally have lower statutory income tax rates than the us  contributing to the overall lower effective income tax rate in  as compared with miscellaneous income in was higher than  due mainly to a million settlement associated with a retirement plan of a former subsidiary in the first quarter of we realized a loss in our nonconsolidated subsidiaries in  due principally to losses in our owned structures operation in mexico 
the mexican loss mainly related to adjustment of receivable and inventory valuations in the third quarter of  which reduced our share of earnings from this nonconsolidated subsidiary by million after tax 
in the fourth quarter of  we purchased the remaining of this subsidiary for million net of cash acquired  plus approximately million in interest bearing debt and certain amounts due to the majority owner 
all of the million in assumed debts were repaid at the closing of the transaction 
our cash flows provided by operations were million in  as compared with million in the lower operating cash flows in resulted from increased working capital required by the increased net sales realized in and a larger share of our income tax expense that was payable in cash  as opposed to being deferred to later periods 
the operating cash flow realized in in part was related to a significant inventory increase in  which was related to widespread shortages in steel in steel availability improved in  which resulted in reduced inventory and  accordingly  improved operating cash flow in  as compared with engineered support structures ess segment general the sales increase in the ess segment in  as compared with  was due to higher sales in all geographic regions 
on a product line basis  the sales increase mainly resulted from stronger sales demand in the lighting and traffic and specialty product lines 
the increased gross profit of the ess segment in  as compared with  was mainly related to the stronger sales and operating performance in china  due to a combination of higher sales of communication structures in china and stronger shipments of utility structures into export markets 
improved sales and gross profit margins in the north american and european lighting markets also contributed to the improvement in operating income 
operational difficulties in our north american locations that are dedicated to specialty structures negatively affected ess segment operating income 
in  we incurred an aggregate of approximately million in expenses in this product line associated with warranty claims on sign structures in north america  receivable and inventory valuation provisions and the write off of the sigma trade name 
in addition  segment profitability was negatively affected by approximately million related to production equipment disposals and employee severance costs in europe 
the main reasons for the increase in sg a expense in  as compared with were increased salary and employee benefit cost expenses million  commissions related to higher sales volumes million  increased international management expenses million and the write off of the sigma trade name million in lighting and traffic products in north america  lighting and traffic structure sales in improved modestly over in the transportation market  while sales were essentially flat as compared with  higher sales order levels achieved after the passage of us highway funding legislation in the third quarter of have resulted in an increased backlog as of december  commercial lighting sales volumes in were higher than  as improvements in the residential and commercial construction markets resulted in higher demand for street and area lighting structures 
the improvement in commercial lighting structure sales was also due to increased demand for decorative lighting structures and expanded relationships with lighting fixture manufacturers 
in europe  lighting sales in were higher than  mainly due to new tramway and decorative lighting structures developed for the european market and improvement in economic conditions in our main market areas 
specialty products in the specialty structures product line  the increase in sales  as compared with  was mainly due to increased sales in wireless communication structures outside of north america 
sales of wireless communication structures and components in north america in were comparable to sign structure sales in were slightly lower than sales of wireless communication structures in china were higher in  as compared with a relatively weak the chinese wireless communication carriers are continuing their investment in structures as part of their plans to improve their coverage and increase services provided to their customers 
utility products this product line includes sales of utility structures for markets outside of north america 
in  the sales increase as compared with was mainly due to export sales of utility structures 
our chinese operations are an important factor in our efforts to compete effectively in these export markets 
in addition  we believe china will continue to increase its investment in basic infrastructure  including electrical energy generation  transmission and distribution 
accordingly  we believe that future demand for our steel structures for these applications will grow 
utility support structures segment in the utility support structures segment  the sales increase in as compared with was due to improved demand for steel and concrete electrical transmission  substation and distribution pole structures 
throughout and into  our order rates for structures from utility companies and independent power producers were relatively strong  as increased emphasis on improving the electrical transmission and distribution infrastructure in the us has resulted in increased demand for structures for those applications 
we also believe that incentives in energy legislation enacted in have encouraged utility companies to invest in their transmission and distribution systems 
all of these factors resulted in substantially improved sales orders  shipments and backlogs in  as compared with gross profit increased at a slightly higher rate than sales in  as compared with due to the strong sales growth in this segment  we were able to realize improved factory productivity to effectively leverage our fixed factory cost structure  although gross profit margins were dampened somewhat by rising material costs applied to certain fixed price sales contracts 
the growth in operating income in  as compared with  related mainly to the growth in sales and leverage of our fixed sg a cost structure 
the main reasons for the increased sg a spending in  as compared with  were increased salary and employee benefit costs million and commission expenses related to higher sales million 
effective november   we acquired the remaining of the shares of our steel pole manufacturing joint venture located in monterrey  mexico 
this operation was not consolidated in our financial statements until november and did not have a significant impact on segment sales and operating income in coatings segment the increase in coatings segment sales in  as compared with  was due to higher sales prices associated with higher zinc costs 
sales volume measured in physical volume of materials processed was up modestly from in  zinc prices were volatile and increased to record levels during the year  especially early in we believe we were successful in recovering our increased zinc costs in the form of higher sales prices 
the increase in operating income in  as compared with  was principally due to improved production efficiencies related to zinc and facility utilization 
gross profit and operating income in also included a million gain associated with the sale of one of our production facilities 
this facility represented excess capacity for us and this sale should not affect our ability to serve our markets 
the increase in sg a spending in  as compared with  was primarily related to higher employee incentives associated with improved operating income 
irrigation segment the sales in the irrigation segment rebounded from a weak the sales increase was due to a combination of higher sales volumes and increased selling prices to recover increased raw material costs 
in north america  improving farm commodity prices and relatively dry growing conditions contributed to modestly improved demand for irrigation machines in  as compared with we believe the increase in year to date sales of irrigation machines and service parts in over levels also resulted from an increase of equipment damaged in winter storms in late international sales in increased approximately over  mainly due to sales in newly developed international markets and generally improved market conditions in africa and latin america over the increase in operating income in over was the result of improved sales volumes and effective control of sg a spending 
the increase in sg a expense from to was mainly attributable to increased employee incentives associated with improved operational performance million and increased bad debts provisions of million in over the increased bad debts provision included a million reversal of an international accounts receivable provision that was realized in the second quarter of other this segment includes our tubing and industrial fastener businesses  our machine tool accessories operation in france and the development costs associated with our wind energy structure initiative 
the increase in sales in  as compared with  was primarily due to improved demand for tubing products 
the main reason for the improvement in operating income this year was approximately million in improved profitability of our machine tool accessory business 
our expenses related to the development of a structure for the wind energy industry in were lower than by approximately million 
in the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to suspend our efforts in this area 
the main reason for this decision was that projected economic returns for us were not sufficient to warrant further development at this time 
as a result  we recorded a million charge to operating income in the fourth quarter of  related mainly to inventory valuation adjustments associated with this decision 
net corporate expense the increase in net corporate expenses in  as compared with  was mainly related to increased employee incentives due to improved earnings this year approximately million  increased occupancy cost related to our corporate headquarters facility million and stock option expense recognized in of million 
approximately million of the occupancy cost increase was related to the termination of our synthetic lease on the corporate headquarters building and release of the related residual value guarantee 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows working capital and operating cash flows net working capital was million at fiscal year end  as compared with million at fiscal year end the increase in working capital was mainly the result of higher accounts receivables and inventories associated with the sales increase in the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was as of december  as compared with at december  operating cash flow was million in  as compared with million in and million in the increase in operating cash flow in  as compared with  resulted from increased net earnings and the timing of income tax payments 
investing cash flows capital spending was million in  as compared with million in  and million in the increase in capital spending primarily related to manufacturing capacity additions in the ess and utility support structures segments 
our depreciation and amortization expenses for  and were million  million and million  respectively 
due mainly to the large growth in the utility support structures and ess segments  we will be investing in additional steel structure manufacturing to meet the market demand in these segments 
accordingly  we estimate that our capital expenditures to be between and million 
we also made other investments and acquisitions over the past three years 
in  we invested an aggregate of million to purchase of the outstanding shares of tehomet  a finnish lighting structure manufacturer million  the remaining of the outstanding shares of our canadian lighting structure manufacturing facility million and certain assets of a galvanizing operation in salina  kansas million 
in  we invested a total of million in our mexican pole manufacturing joint venture  including million net of cash acquired for the remaining ownership in this entity 
financing cash flows total interest bearing debt increased from million in to million as of december  most of this increase related to the debt associated with the tehomet acquisition  offset to a degree by the scheduled debt repayments on our existing debt 
sources of financing and capital we have historically funded our growth  capital spending and acquisitions through a combination of operating cash flows and debt financing 
we have an internal long term objective to maintain long term debt as a percent of invested capital at or below 
at december   our long term debt to invested capital ratio was  as compared with at the end of fiscal this internal objective is exceeded from time to time in order to take advantage of opportunities to grow and improve our businesses 
we believe the acquisitions described above were appropriate opportunities to expand our market coverage and product offerings and generate earnings growth 
while our long term debt to capital ratio exceeded our objective as a result of the newmark acquisition in april  our cash flows enabled us to reduce our long term debt levels to under of invested capital by september dependent on our level of acquisition activity and steel industry availability and pricing issues  we expect our long term debt to invested capital ratio to remain below in our priorities in use of future cash flows are as follows fund internal growth initiatives in core businesses pay down interest bearing debt invest in acquisitions connected to our core businesses or an existing competency return money to our shareholders through increased dividends or common stock repurchases at appropriate share prices our debt financing at december  consisted mainly of long term debt 
we also maintain certain short term bank lines of credit totaling million  million of which was unused at december  our long term debt principally consists of million of senior subordinated notes that bear interest at per annum and are due in may we may repurchase the notes starting in may at specified prepayment premiums 
these notes are guaranteed by certain of our us subsidiaries 
million revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that accrues interest at our option at a the higher of the prime lending rate and the federal funds rate plus basis points or b an interest rate spread over the libor of to basis points inclusive of facility fees  depending on our ratio of debt to earnings before taxes  interest  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
at december   we had in outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  at an interest rate of 
the revolving credit agreement has a termination date of may  and contains certain financial covenants that limit our additional borrowing capability under the agreement 
at december   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under this facility 
term loan with a group of banks that accrues interest at our option at a the higher of the prime lending rate and the federal funds rate plus basis points or b libor plus a spread of to basis points  depending on our debt to ebitda ratio and had an outstanding balance of million at december  this loan requires quarterly principal payments through the annualized principal payments beginning in in millions are and the effective interest rate on this loan was per annum at december  under these debt agreements  we are obligated by covenants that require us to maintain certain coverage ratios and may limit us with respect to certain business activities  including capital expenditures 
our key debt covenants are that interest bearing debt is not to exceed x ebitda of the prior four quarters and that our ebitda over our prior four quarters must be at least x our interest expense over the same period 
at december  we were in compliance with all covenants related to these debt agreements 
based on our available credit facilities and our history of positive cash flows from operations  we believe that we have adequate liquidity to meet our needs 
in january  we acquired substantially all of the assets of penn summit llc  for approximately million in cash 
this acquisition price was financed by approximately million of cash we had on deposit  with the remainder funded through our revolving credit agreement 
in february  we acquired of the outstanding shares of west coast engineering group  ltd 
for million canadian dollars million us dollars 
the purchase price was financed through our revolving credit agreement 
financial obligations and financial commitments we have future financial obligations related to payment of principal and interest on interest bearing debt  including capital lease obligations  various operating leases and purchase obligations 
these obligations as of december  are summarized as follows  in millions of dollars contractual obligations total after long term debt interest unconditional purchase obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations long term debt principally consists of the million of senior subordinated notes and the bank term loan million was outstanding at december  
we had an outstanding balance on our revolving credit agreement of million at december  we also had various other borrowing arrangements aggregating million at december  obligations under these agreements could be accelerated in event of non compliance with covenants 
as part of the sale of our machine tools accessories operation in january  we transferred the capital lease on the facility to the purchaser 
operating leases relate mainly to various production and office facilities and are in the normal course of business 
unconditional purchase obligations relate to purchase orders for zinc  aluminum and steel  all of which will be used in we believe the quantities under contract are reasonable in light of normal fluctuations in business levels and we expect to use the commodities under contract during the contract period 
at december   we had approximately million of various unrecognized income tax benefits that are not scheduled above because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the timing of any potential tax payments 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating lease obligations to unaffiliated parties on leases of certain production and office facilities and equipment 
these leases are in the normal course of business and generally contain no substantial obligations for us at the end of the lease contracts 
we also have certain commercial commitments related to contingent events that could create a financial obligation for us 
our commitments at december  were as follows in millions of dollars commitment expiration period other commercial commitments total amounts committed thereafter standby letters of credit total commercial commitments the above commitments are loan guarantees of a non consolidated subsidiary in argentina that is accompanied by a guarantee from the majority owner to us 
we also maintain standby letters of credit for contract performance on certain sales contracts 
market risk changes in prices certain key materials we use are commodities traded in worldwide markets and are subject to fluctuations in price 
the most significant materials are steel  aluminum  zinc and natural gas 
over the last several years  prices for these commodities have been volatile 
the volatility in these prices was due to such factors as fluctuations in supply  government tariffs and the costs of steel making inputs 
we have also experienced volatility in natural gas prices in the past several years  especially in  zinc prices rose rapidly and reached a record high price in late our main strategies in managing these risks are a combination of fixed price purchase contracts with our vendors to reduce the volatility in our purchase prices and sales price increases where possible 
we use natural gas swap contracts to mitigate the impact of rising gas prices on our operating income 
risk management market risk the principal market risks affecting us are exposure to interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and natural gas 
we normally do not use derivative financial instruments to hedge these exposures except as described below  nor do we use derivatives for trading purposes 
interest rates our interest bearing debt is a mix of fixed and variable rate debt 
assuming average interest rates and borrowings on variable rate debt  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have an impact on interest expense of approximately million in and foreign exchange exposures to transactions denominated in a currency other than the entity s functional currency are not material  and therefore the potential exchange losses in future earnings  fair value and cash flows from these transactions are immaterial 
much of our cash in non us entities is denominated in foreign currencies  where fluctuations in exchange rates will impact cash balances in us dollar terms 
a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar would impact our reported cash balance by approximately million in and million in we manage our investment risk in foreign operations by borrowing in the functional currencies of the foreign entities where appropriate 
the following table indicates the change in the recorded value of our investments at year end assuming a hypothetical change in the value of the us dollar 
in millions europe asia south america mexico south africa commodity risk natural gas is a significant commodity used in our factories  especially in our coatings segment galvanizing operations  where natural gas is used to heat tanks that enable the hot dipped galvanizing process 
natural gas prices are volatile and we mitigate some of this volatility through the use of derivative commodity instruments 
our current policy is to manage this commodity price risk for of our us natural gas requirements for the upcoming months through the purchase of natural gas swaps based on nymex futures prices for delivery in the month being hedged 
the objective of this policy is to mitigate the impact on our earnings of sudden  significant increases in the price of natural gas 
our annual us gas requirements are approximately  mmbtu 
we have purchased swaps totaling approximately of our expected us requirements through february the fair value of these instruments is based on quoted market prices from the nymex 
market risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in price 
as of december  our market risk exposure related to future natural gas requirements being hedged was approximately million based on a sensitivity analysis 
changes in the market value of these derivative instruments have a high correlation to changes in the spot price of natural gas 
since we forward price only a portion of our natural gas requirements  this hypothetical adverse impact on natural gas derivative instruments would be more than offset by lower costs for all natural gas we purchase 
critical accounting policies the following accounting policies involve judgments and estimates used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
there is a substantial amount of management judgment used in preparing financial statements 
we must make estimates on a number of items  such as provisions for bad debts  warranties  contingencies  impairments of long lived assets  and inventory obsolescence 
we base our estimates on our experience and on other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
further  we re evaluate our estimates from time to time and as circumstances change 
actual results may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
the selection and application of our critical accounting policies are discussed annually with our audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts in determining an allowance for accounts receivable that will not ultimately be collected in full  we consider age of the accounts receivable customer credit history customer financial information reasons for non payment product  service or billing issues 
if our customers financial condition was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payment  additional allowances may be required 
warranties all of our businesses must meet certain product quality and performance criteria 
we rely on historical product claims data to estimate the cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
in determining the accrual for the estimated cost of warranty claims  we consider our experience with costs to correct the product problem in the field  including labor costs costs for replacement parts other direct costs associated with warranty claims the number of product units subject to warranty claims in addition to known claims or warranty issues  we estimate future claims on recent sales 
the key assumptions in our estimates are the rates we apply to those recent sales which is based on historical claims experience and our expected future warranty costs for products that are covered under warranty for an extended period of time 
our provision for various product warranties was approximately million at december  if our estimate changed by  the impact on operating income would be approximately million 
if our cost to repair a product or the number of products subject to warranty claims is greater than we estimated  then we would have to increase our accrued cost for warranty claims 
inventories we use the last in first out lifo method to determine the value of the majority of our inventory 
approximately of inventory is valued at the lower of cost  determined by the lifo method 
the remaining of our inventory is valued on a first in first out fifo basis 
in periods of rising costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in lower profits than fifo  because higher more recent costs are recorded to cost of goods sold than under the fifo method 
conversely  in periods of falling costs to produce inventory  the lifo method will result in higher profits than the fifo method 
in  we experienced substantially higher costs to produce inventory than in the prior respective years  due mainly to higher costs for steel  steel related products and zinc 
this resulted in higher cost of goods sold and lower operating income in of approximately million than had our entire inventory been valued on the fifo method 
the and  prices decreased modestly and operating income would have decreased by approximately million in each year  had our entire inventory been valued on the fifo method 
we write down slow moving and obsolete inventory by the difference between the value of the inventory and our estimate of the reduced value based on potential future uses  the likelihood that overstocked inventory will be sold and the expected selling prices of the inventory 
if our ability to realize value on slow moving or obsolete inventory is less favorable than assumed  additional write downs of the inventory may be required 
depreciation  amortization and impairment of long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets that were acquired in business acquisitions 
we have assigned useful lives to our property  plant and equipment and certain intangible assets ranging from to years 
we annually evaluate our reporting units for goodwill impairment during the third fiscal quarter  which coincides with our strategic planning process 
we assess the value of our reporting units using after tax cash flows from operations less capital expenditures discounted to present value and as a multiple of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
the key assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis are the discount rate and the annual free cash flow 
we also use sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in discount rates and cash flow forecasts on the valuation of the reporting units 
as allowed for under sfas no 
 we rely on our previous valuations for the annual impairment testing provided that the following criteria for each reporting unit are met the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination and the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin 
in the case of most of our reporting units  the above criteria have been met and no further evaluation was required 
if our assumptions about intangible assets change as a result of events or circumstances  and we believe the assets may have declined in value  then we may record impairment charges  resulting in lower profits 
our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of trade names and their values are separately assessed from goodwill as part of the annual impairment testing 
this assessment is made using the relief from royalty method  under which the value of a trade name is determined based on a royalty that could be charged to a third party for using the trade name in question 
the royalty  which is based on a reasonable rate applied against forecasted sales  is tax effected and discounted to present value 
the most significant assumptions in this evaluation include estimated future sales  the royalty rate and the after tax discount rate 
for our evaluation purposes  the royalty rates used vary between and of sales and the after tax discount rate of  which we estimate to be our after tax cost of capital 
stock based compensation our employees are periodically granted stock options by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  the compensation cost of all employee stock based compensation awards is measured based on the grant date fair value of those awards and that cost is recorded as compensation expense over the period during which the employee is required to perform service in exchange for the award generally over the vesting period of the award 
the valuation of stock option awards is complex in that there are a number of variables included in the calculation of the value of a stock option award volatility of our stock price expected term of the option expected dividend yield risk free interest rate over the expected term expected number of options that will not vest we have elected to use a binomial pricing model in the valuation of our stock options because we believe it provides a more accurate measure of the value of employee stock options 
the assumptions used in our valuation of stock options were as follows in  and volatility expected term from vesting date yrs 
yrs 
yrs 
risk free interest rate dividend yield these variables are developed using a combination of our internal data with respect to stock price volatility and exercise behavior of option holders and information from outside sources 
the development of each of these variables requires a significant amount of judgment 
changes in the values of the above variables will result in different option valuations and  therefore  different amounts of compensation cost 
the per share value of options granted in was lower using the assumptions  than if the assumptions had been used 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income expectations and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we estimate a deferred tax asset is not likely to be fully realized in the future  a valuation allowance to decrease the amount of the deferred tax asset would decrease net earnings in the period the determination was made 
likewise  if we subsequently determine that we are able to realize all or part of a net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment reducing the valuation allowance would increase net earnings in the period such determination was made 
at december   we had approximately million in deferred tax assets relating mainly to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  with a valuation allowance of million 
in  we added a net million of valuation allowances and  accordingly  increased our income tax expense  because we determined that  based on facts and circumstances  the realization of these deferred tax assets was not more likely than not 
the most significant increase in our valuation allowance was million related to the uncertainty in realization of the net operating loss and asset tax carryforwards in our mexican utility structures facility due to changes in mexican tax law 
we determined that  based on the new tax law  we would not likely be able to realize the full value of these carryforwards 
accordingly  we established the valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets 
if these circumstances change in the future  we may be required to increase or decrease the valuation allowance on these assets  resulting in an increase or decrease in income tax expense and a reduction or increase in net income 
we are subject to examination by taxing authorities in the various countries in which we operate 
the tax years subject to examination vary by jurisdiction 
we regularly consider the likelihood of additional income tax assessments in each of these taxing jurisdictions based on our experiences related to prior audits and our understanding of the facts and circumstances of the related tax issues 
we include in current income tax expense any changes to accruals for potential tax deficiencies 
if our judgments related to tax deficiencies differ from our actual experience  our income tax expense could increase or decrease in a given fiscal period
