bank holding company regulation bancorp is a one bank financial holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act act  and as such  is subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the federal reserve bank frb 
bancorp has been designated a financial holding company as defined in the gramm leach bliley act see description below  and does not expect such designation to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
bancorp is required to file annual reports with the frb and to provide the frb such additional information as the frb may require 
the act requires every bank holding company to obtain the prior approval of the frb before acquiring  directly or indirectly  ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if  after such acquisition  it would own or control more than of such shares unless it already owns or controls the majority of such shares  acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company  or merging or consolidating with another bank holding company 
the frb will not approve any acquisition  merger or consolidation that would have a substantial anticompetitive result  unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by a greater public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served 
the frb also considers capital adequacy and other financial and managerial factors in reviewing acquisitions or mergers 
with certain exceptions  the act also prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring or retaining direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or bank holding company  or from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks  or providing services for its subsidiaries 
the principal exceptions to these prohibitions involve certain non bank activities  which by statute or by frb regulation or order  have been identified as activities closely related to the business of banking or of managing or controlling banks 
in making this determination  the frb considers whether the performance of such activities by a bank holding company can be expected to produce benefits to the public such as greater convenience  increased competition or gains in efficiency in resources  which can be expected to outweigh the risks of possible adverse effects such as decreased or unfair competition  conflicts of interest or unsound banking practices 
state regulations concerning cash dividends the principal source of bancorp s cash revenues have been provided from dividends received from the bank 
the oregon banking laws impose certain limitations on the payment of dividends by oregon state chartered banks 
the amount of the dividend may not be greater than the bank s unreserved retained earnings  deducting from that  to the extent not already charged against earnings or reflected in a reserve  the following all bad debts  which are debts on which interest is past due and unpaid for at least six months  unless the debt is fully secured and in the process of collection  all other assets charged off as required by the director of the department of consumer and business services or a state or federal examiner  all accrued expenses  interest and taxes of the institution 
in addition  the appropriate regulatory authorities are authorized to prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends  which would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
the bank and bancorp are not currently subject to any regulatory restrictions on their dividends other than those noted above 
federal and state bank regulation the bank is a federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insured bank which is not a member of the federal reserve system  is subject to the supervision and regulation of the state of oregon department of consumer and business services  division of finance and corporate securities  and the idaho department of finance  respectively  and to the supervision and regulation of the fdic 
these agencies may prohibit the bank from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices 
the community reinvestment act cra requires that  in connection with examinations of financial institutions within their jurisdiction  the frb or the fdic evaluate the record of the financial institutions in meeting the credit needs of their local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with the safe and sound operation of those banks 
these factors are also considered in evaluating mergers  acquisitions and applications to open a branch or facility 
the current cra rating of the bank is satisfactory 
the bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by the federal reserve act on extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  principal shareholders or any related interest of such persons 
extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms  collateral and following credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not described above  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
the bank is also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons 
a violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the bank or any officer  director  employee  agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of the bank  the imposition of a cease and desist order  and other regulatory sanctions 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia  each federal banking agency is required to prescribe by regulation  non capital safety and soundness standards for institutions under its authority 
these standards are to cover internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  compensation  fees and benefits  such other operational and managerial standards as the agency determines to be appropriate  and standards for asset quality  earnings and stock valuation 
an institution  which fails to meet these standards  must develop a plan acceptable to the agency  specifying the steps that the institution will take to meet the standards 
failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions 
the company believes that the bank meets substantially all the standards that have been adopted 
capital adequacy and prompt corrective action banks and bank holding companies are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by state and federal banking agencies 
capital adequacy guidelines and  additionally for banks  prompt corrective action regulations  involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weighting and other factors 
the federal reserve board  the office of the comptroller of the currency occ and the fdic have substantially similar risk based capital ratio and leverage ratio guidelines for banking organizations 
the guidelines are intended to ensure that banking organizations have adequate capital given the risk levels of assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
under the guidelines  banking organizations are required to maintain minimum ratios for tier capital and total capital to risk weighted assets including certain off balance sheet items  such as letters of credit 
for purposes of calculating the ratios  a banking organization s assets and some of its specified off balance sheet commitments and obligations are assigned to various risk categories 
a depository institution s or holding company s capital  in turn  is classified in one of three tiers  depending on type core capital tier 
tier capital includes common equity  retained earnings  qualifying non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual stock at the holding company level  minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  qualifying trust preferred securities  less goodwill  most intangible assets and certain other assets 
supplementary capital tier 
tier capital includes  among other things  perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities not meeting the tier definition  qualifying mandatory convertible debt securities  qualifying subordinated debt  and allowances for possible loan and lease losses  subject to limitations 
market risk capital tier 
tier capital includes qualifying unsecured subordinated debt 
bancorp  like other bank holding companies  currently is required to maintain tier capital and total capital the sum of tier  tier and tier capital equal to at least and  respectively  of its total risk weighted assets including various off balance sheet items  such as letters of credit 
the bank  like other depository institutions  is required to maintain similar capital levels under capital adequacy guidelines 
for a depository institution to be considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  its tier and total capital ratios must be at least and on a risk adjusted basis  respectively 
bank holding companies and banks subject to the market risk capital guidelines are required to incorporate market and interest rate risk components into their risk based capital standards 
under the market risk capital guidelines  capital is allocated to support the amount of market risk related to a financial institution s ongoing trading activities 
bank holding companies and banks are also required to comply with minimum leverage ratio requirements 
the leverage ratio is the ratio of a banking organization s tier capital to its total adjusted quarterly average assets as defined for regulatory purposes 
the requirements necessitate a minimum leverage ratio of for financial holding companies and national banks that either have the highest supervisory rating or have implemented the appropriate federal regulatory authority s risk adjusted measure for market risk 
all other financial holding companies and national banks are required to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of  unless a different minimum is specified by an appropriate regulatory authority 
for a depository institution to be considered well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  its leverage ratio must be at least 
the federal deposit insurance act  as amended fdia  requires among other things  the federal banking agencies to take prompt corrective action in respect of depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
the fdia sets forth the following five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier will depend upon how its capital levels compare with various relevant capital measures and certain other factors  as established by regulation 
the relevant capital measures are the total capital ratio  the tier capital ratio and the leverage ratio 
under the regulations adopted by the federal regulatory authorities  a bank will be i well capitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or greater  and is not subject to any order or written directive by any such regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure  ii adequately capitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater  and a leverage ratio of or greater and is not well capitalized  iii undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than  iv significantly undercapitalized if the institution has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than or a leverage ratio of less than  and v critically undercapitalized if the institution s tangible equity is equal or less than of average quarterly tangible assets 
an institution may be downgraded to  or deemed to be in  a capital category that is lower than indicated by its capital ratios if it is determined to be in an unsafe or unsound condition or if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating with respect to certain matters 
the company believes that  as of december   the bank was well capitalized  based on the ratios and guidelines described above 
a bank s capital category is determined solely for the purpose of applying prompt corrective action regulations  and the capital category may not constitute an accurate representation of the bank s overall financial condition or prospects for other purposes 
the fdia generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distributions including payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its parent holding company if the depository institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
undercapitalized institutions are subject to growth limitations and are required to submit a capital restoration plan 
the agencies may not accept such a plan without determining  among other things  that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution s capital 
in addition  for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable  the depository institution s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan 
the aggregate liability of the parent holding company is limited to the lesser of i an amount equal to of the depository institution s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and ii the amount which is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan 
if a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it is significantly undercapitalized 
significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions  including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized  requirements to reduce total assets  and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks 
critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator 
at december   the company s leverage  tier capital and total risked based capital ratios were  and  respectively
