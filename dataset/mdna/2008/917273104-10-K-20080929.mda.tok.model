this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of selected factors  including those set forth under risk factors in item a 
all forward looking statements included herein are based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we undertake no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
overview urologix develops  manufactures  and markets non surgical  catheter based therapies that use a proprietary cooled microwave technology for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia bph  a disease that affects more than million men worldwide 
we market our control units under the targis and coolwave names and our procedure kits under the recently approved ctc advance  ctc  targis and prostaprobe names 
all systems utilize the company s cooled thermotherapy technology  a targeted microwave energy combined with a unique cooling mechanism that protects healthy tissue and enhances patient comfort while providing safe  effective  lasting relief from the symptoms of bph 
cooled thermotherapy can be performed without general anesthesia or intravenous sedation and can be performed in a physician s office or an outpatient clinic 
we believe that cooled thermotherapy provides an efficacious  safe and cost effective solution for bph with results clinically superior to medication and without the complications and side effects inherent in surgical procedures 
we believe that third party reimbursement is essential to the continued adoption of cooled thermotherapy  and that clinical efficacy  overall cost effectiveness and physician advocacy will be keys to maintaining such reimbursement 
we estimate that to of patients who receive cooled thermotherapy treatment in the united states will be eligible for medicare coverage 
the remaining patients will either be covered by private insurers  including traditional indemnity health insurers and managed care organizations  or they will be private paying patients 
as a result  medicare reimbursement is particularly critical for widespread market adoption of cooled thermotherapy in the united states 
the level of medicare reimbursement for cooled thermotherapy is dependent on the site of service 
in calendar year the reimbursement rate for a hospital performing our treatment on an outpatient basis is approximately  and the reimbursement for the urologist performing the cooled thermotherapy treatment is approximately per procedure 
the reimbursement rate inclusive of the physician s fee in calendar year for cooled thermotherapy procedures performed in the urologist s office is  which is subject to geographic adjustment 
in january  the cpt code covering cooled thermotherapy was once again added to the asc list of medicare approved procedures 
effective with this latest change  urologists who perform cooled thermotherapy procedures in an asc are reimbursed under the two part system in which the asc receives a fixed fee of  for calendar year  while the urologist performing the treatment is reimbursed for calendar year for calendar  cms is proposing additional reductions in the physician fee schedule covering cooled thermotherapy 
the exact amount of the reduction has not yet been determined however  initial estimates were in the range of a percent decrease 
we are actively participating in the comment process related to the proposed reductions  have an active reimbursement strategy  and have retained consultative experts to assist us with dealing with the proposed reimbursement rate reductions 
private insurance companies and hmos make their own determinations regarding coverage and reimbursement based upon usual and customary fees 
to date  we have received coverage and reimbursement in various geographies from private insurance companies and hmos throughout the united states 
we intend to 
table of contents continue our efforts to gain coverage and reimbursement across the united states 
there can be no assurance that we will receive favorable coverage or reimbursement determinations for cooled thermotherapy from these payers or that amounts reimbursed to physicians for performing cooled thermotherapy procedures will be sufficient to encourage physicians to use cooled thermotherapy 
our goal is to grow cooled thermotherapy as a standard of care for the treatment of bph 
our business strategy to achieve this goal is i to educate both patients and physicians on the benefits of cooled thermotherapy compared to other treatment options  ii to increase the use of cooled thermotherapy by physicians who already have access to a cooled thermotherapy system  iii to increase the number of physicians who provide cooled thermotherapy to their patients  and iv to provide more physicians with access to cooled thermotherapy through the use of third party mobile providers and our own cooled thermotherapy mobile service in the united states 
we expect to continue to invest in research and development and clinical trials  sales and marketing programs and our cooled thermotherapy mobile service as we focus on growing revenues and continuing to improve our therapy 
our future growth will be dependent upon  among other factors  our success in achieving increased treatment volume and market adoption of the cooled thermotherapy procedures in the physician s office  including treatments delivered through our cooled thermotherapy mobile service  our success in obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory clearances  as well as the risk of fda mandated recall of our products  our ability to manufacture at the volumes and quantities the market requires  the fact that our products may be subject to product recalls even after receiving fda clearance or approval  the extent to which medicare and other health care payers continue to reimburse costs of cooled thermotherapy procedures performed in physicians offices  hospitals  and ambulatory surgery centers and the amount of reimbursement provided 
critical accounting policies and estimates in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidance  we set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition  and require complex management judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of cooled thermotherapy system control units upon delivery to the customer 
in addition to our sales of cooled thermotherapy system control units  we place our cooled thermotherapy system control units with customers under a variety of programs for both evaluation and long term use  and also provide access to cooled thermotherapy treatments via our cooled thermotherapy mobile service 
we retain title to the control units placed with our customers for evaluation and longer term use and do not recognize any revenue on these control units until title has transferred 
these programs  as well as our cooled thermotherapy mobile service  are designed to expand access to our technology  and thus expand the market for our single use treatment catheters 
revenue from our mobile service is recognized upon treatment of the patient 
revenue from the sale of single use treatment catheters is recognized at the time of shipment 
revenue for warranty service contracts is deferred and recognized over the contract period and revenue subject to certain sales incentives is deferred based upon the contract provisions 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns on product sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
the provision for estimated sales returns is based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and specific customer based circumstances 
should actual sales returns differ from our estimates  revisions to the sales return reserve would be required 
sales and use taxes are reported on a net basis  excluding them from revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we consider factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic 
table of contents conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay when determining the adequacy of the allowance 
accounts receivable are written off after management determines they are uncollectible 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
product warranty we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the trend in the product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs  the historical length of time between the sale and resulting warranty claim and other factors 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or repair costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventories we value our inventories  consisting primarily of control units  single use treatment catheters  and raw materials to produce the control units and treatment catheters  at the lower of cost or market value on the first in  first out fifo basis 
the inventory cost includes both merchandise and freight 
a periodic review of the inventory on hand is performed to determine if the inventory is properly stated at the lower of cost or market 
in performing this analysis we consider  at a minimum  the following factors average selling prices  reimbursement changes  and changes in demand for our products due to competitive conditions or market acceptance 
each type of inventory is analyzed to determine net realizable values 
a provision is recorded to reduce the cost of inventories to the estimated net realizable values  if required 
we also analyze the level of inventory on hand on a periodic basis  in relation to estimated customer requirements to determine whether write downs for excess  obsolete  or slow moving inventory are required 
any significant or unanticipated change in the factors noted above could have a significant impact on the value of our inventories and on our reported operating results 
valuation of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill we recorded a million charge to fully impair our goodwill as of december  sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or at an interim period when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
as a result of our decline in stock price  coupled with recent negative operating results and further impairments of our other long lived assets  we again tested the goodwill for impairment as of december  based on this impairment test  we concluded that goodwill was fully impaired as of december  see note for a description of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in fiscal year as of june   identifiable intangible assets consist of a customer base of  and patents of  in accordance with sfas no 
 we review identifiable intangible assets for impairment as changes in circumstance or the occurrence of events suggests the remaining value is not recoverable 
these events include continued losses or a projection of continued losses  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  or a change in the expected use of an asset 
when a trigger event occurs  an impairment calculation is performed  comparing projected undiscounted future cash flows  utilizing current cash flow information to the carrying amount of those assets 
if impairment is identified for long lived assets  discounted future cash flows are compared to the asset s current carrying amount 
impairment is recorded when the carrying amount exceeds the discounted cash flows 
at june   in connection with our strategy to develop a next generation catheter  we implemented an end of life plan for our prostatron control units and prostaprobe catheters which resulted in asset impairment charges of  related to developed technologies  customer base  and trademarks 
in addition  the remaining estimated useful life of the developed technologies and trademarks were reduced from years to years at june  at december   we took additional impairment charges of 
table of contents  related to the prostatron control units and prostaprobe catheters as a result of declining sales projections for this product line 
as a result  our developed technologies and trademark assets have been completely written off 
the remaining balance of the customer base is being amortized using the straight line method over the next years  its estimated remaining useful life 
the patent intangible assets relate to fees incurred for patents that have not yet been issued 
we will begin amortization of these patent costs once the patents have been issued 
sales tax accrual we maintain an accrual for sales tax liabilities we discover 
the amount of the accrual is based on finding from sales tax audits and correspondence with state taxing authorities which indicate we may owe sales tax on items previously considered exempt  charged at incorrect tax rates  or for items which were not taxed by our vendors and we failed to self assess the sales tax 
the accrual amount also includes interest and penalties which will result from these finding 
any unanticipated changes in the factors used to determine the amount of the accrual based on continued discussions and negotiations with the various state taxing authorities could result in changes to the amount of sales tax accrual required 
based on a recent sales tax audit and new information obtained by the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we believe we may have additional sales tax exposure in some states related to our mobile service business 
as a result  we felt a liability was probable under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for contingencies and increased our sales tax accrual by approximately  in the fourth quarter of fiscal for sales we previously believed to be exempt 
this change in accounting estimate resulted in an increase to our fiscal year net loss of  or per diluted share 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax liabilities or assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
we have recorded and continue to carry a full valuation allowance against our gross deferred tax assets that will not reserve against deferred tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance necessary to offset our deferred tax assets that will not be recoverable 
if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not that we will realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we will adjust our valuation allowance in the period we make the determination 
we expect to provide a full valuation allowance on our future tax benefits until we can sustain a level of profitability that demonstrates our ability to realize these assets 
at june   we carried a valuation allowance of million against our remaining net deferred tax assets 
stock based compensation on july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  we recognize compensation expense on all stock option awards granted subsequent to july   as well as on any existing awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after july  in addition  compensation expense is recognized on the unvested portion of stock options granted prior to july  the amount of compensation expense is based on the fair value of the option award at the date of grant and is recognized over the requisite service period which corresponds to the option vesting period 
options typically vest percent after the first year of service with the remaining vesting th each month thereafter 
generally  options granted to non employee directors are immediately exercisable at the date of grant 
options are priced based on the closing price of a share of our common stock at the date of grant 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
to determine the inputs for the black scholes option pricing model we use 
table of contents historical data to estimate expected volatility and the period of time that option grants are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the estimated life of the option 
the range of these assumptions and the range of option pricing and number of options granted at the different grant dates will impact our calculation of the fair value of the awards and will therefore impact the amount of expense reflected in our statement of operations for any given period 
results of operations fiscal years ended june  and net sales net sales decreased percent to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in sales from fiscal is primarily due to reduced orders for procedure kits as a result of lost accounts  both direct and mobile  a reduction in the average order size of accounts  as well as our inability to meet demand for prostaprobes as we awaited an end of life build from our supplier 
sales were also down as a result of continued turnover in our sales force  as well as disruptions in our mobile business from employee turnover 
during fiscal  revenue from catheter sales to direct accounts constituted percent of sales compared to percent in the prior fiscal year  while our mobile treatments comprised percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent in the prior year 
the remaining one percent of our sales in fiscal were from sales of our control units and warranty service contracts 
cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold includes raw materials  labor  overhead  and royalties incurred in connection with the production of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters  amortization related to developed technologies  as well as costs associated with the delivery of our cooled thermotherapy mobile service 
cost of goods sold for fiscal decreased to million or percent from million in fiscal  and is primarily due to the percent decrease in sales from fiscal to fiscal fiscal year includes a million in asset impairment charges related to developed technologies and prostatron fixed assets  and a  write down of prostatron inventory as a result of the implementation of an end of life plan for our prostatron control units and prostaprobe catheters 
gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
gross profit margin rates were lower by in the prior fiscal year as a result of the asset impairment charges and inventory write down in fiscal mentioned above 
excluding the asset impairment charges and inventory write downs  gross profit as a percentage of sales was down approximately in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of lower sales and production volume of our treatment catheters  which provide a smaller base to absorb our fixed manufacturing overhead costs and an increase in the number of mobile unit treatments as a percentage of sales  which have lower overall margins 
selling  general administrative selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased  or percent to million from million in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expense is largely the result of a  increase to our sales tax accrual as a result of a recent sales tax audit and new information obtained by the company in the fourth quarter of fiscal  in which we believe we may have additional sales tax exposure in some states related to our mobile service business 
as a result  we felt it was probable under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for contingencies to increase our sales tax reserve by approximately  in the fourth quarter of fiscal for sales we previously believed to be exempt 
in addition  there was a  increase in wages and benefits as a result of  of severance accruals recorded during the year for former company executives  and a  increase in legal 
table of contents and audit expenses for special projects 
these increases were partially offset by  decrease in sales and marketing expenses largely as a result of a  decrease in sales and marketing wages and a  decrease in travel and entertainment due to an average decrease in headcount during fiscal  as well as an  decrease in commission expense as a result of reduced sales 
research and development research and development expenses  which include expenditures for product development  regulatory compliance and clinical studies  decreased to million  or percent at june  from million at june  the decrease in research and development is mainly due to a  decrease in wages and benefits as a result of reduced headcount and a  decrease in consulting  partially offset by an approximate  increase in product testing and project materials related to our newest catheter  ctc advance 
amortization and impairment of identifiable intangible assets amortization and impairment of identifiable intangible assets decreased to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal the decrease in amortization and impairment expense is the result of the implementation of an end of life plan at june  for the prostatron control units and prostaprobe catheters in connection with our strategy to develop a next generation catheter 
the current year impairment and amortization expense is a result of the write off of our trademark intangible asset of  as well as the additional write down of the customer base of  in december  and continued amortization of our remaining customer base intangible asset over its remaining useful life of years  as compared to asset impairment charges of  related to the prostatron customer base and  related to the prostatron trademarks in fiscal goodwill impairment we recorded a million charge to fully impair our goodwill as of december  sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment annually or at an interim period when events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
as a result of our decline in stock price  coupled with recent negative operating results and further impairments of our other long lived assets  we again tested the goodwill for impairment as of december  based on this impairment test  we concluded that goodwill was fully impaired as of december  the goodwill impairment charge does not affect the company s operations  cash flow or cash position 
net interest income net interest income for fiscal decreased to  from  in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease is due to lower cash and investment balances and lower interest rates 
provision for income taxes we recorded million of income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended june  compared to an income tax expense of million in fiscal the income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended june  is a result of a million reversal of the deferred tax liability balance related to goodwill which was no longer necessary after the impairment of goodwill at december  this was partially offset by approximately  of tax expense mainly related to state taxes 
the million of tax expense at june  was to increase our valuation allowance to fully reserve our deferred tax assets that will not reverse against deferred tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period based on management s assessment of evidence  including the net loss in fiscal in addition to the million of tax expense to increase our valuation allowance  we recorded  of income tax expense during the fiscal year related to state taxes 

table of contents fiscal years ended june  and net sales net sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in sales from fiscal was primarily due to reduced orders from our direct accounts  which includes both direct office and third party mobile accounts  as well as reduced average selling prices asp s for our disposable treatment catheters as a result of pricing pressures created by competition and reduced reimbursement rates 
this decrease in sales from direct accounts was partially offset by an increase in sales of percent from our mobile services that began operations in september the introduction of our mobile services operations in september had a direct impact to our overall sales mix 
during fiscal  percent of sales were derived from treatment catheters  compared to percent in the prior fiscal year  while our mobile treatments comprised percent of total sales in fiscal compared to percent in the prior year 
the remaining percent of our sales in fiscal were from sales of our control units and warranty service contracts 
cost of goods sold and gross profit cost of goods sold includes raw materials  labor  overhead  and royalties incurred in connection with the production of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters  amortization related to developed technologies  as well as costs associated with the delivery of our cooled thermotherapy mobile service 
cost of goods sold for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in cost of goods sold was primarily due to million in asset impairment charges related to developed technologies and prostatron fixed assets  as well as a  write down of prostatron inventory as a result of the implementation of an end of life plan for our prostatron control units and prostaprobe catheters in connection with our strategy to develop a next generation catheter 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to in fiscal from in the prior fiscal year 
gross profit margin rates decreased as a result of the asset impairment charges and inventory write down mentioned above  and the remaining decrease resulted from decreased sales and production volume of our treatment catheters  which provide a smaller base to absorb our fixed manufacturing overhead costs  an increase in the number of mobile unit treatments  which have lower overall margins  increases in overall material costs  as well as increased costs during the three month period ended september  related to the resolution of manufacturing issues identified in the fourth quarter of fiscal these manufacturing issues did not continue into the rest of fiscal selling  general administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal decreased million or percent to million from million in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense was largely the result of a decrease in wages  benefits  commissions  and travel largely due to a decrease in our sales  the size of our sales force  and a decrease in advertising and promotional expense associated with the launch of the new coolwave control unit 
these expense reductions were partially offset by increased legal  audit and consulting fees when compared to fiscal  as well as  of severance expense as a result of a headcount reduction in june research and development research and development expenses  which include expenditures for product development  regulatory compliance and clinical studies  remained relatively flat at million for both fiscal and research and development expenses for fiscal related primarily to expenditures incurred in development of our next generation catheter  as compared with fiscal when expenditures related primarily to activities related to our next generation coolwave control unit 

table of contents amortization and impairment of identifiable intangible assets amortization and impairment of identifiable intangible assets increased to  in fiscal compared to amortization of  in fiscal the increase in amortization and impairment expense was the result of the implementation of an end of life plan at june  for the prostatron control units and prostaprobe catheters in connection with our strategy to develop a next generation catheter 
this decision resulted in asset impairment charges  in accordance with sfas no 
 of  related to the prostatron customer base and  related to the prostatron trademarks 
net interest income net interest income for fiscal increased to  from  in the prior fiscal year 
the increase was due to higher cash and investment balances and higher interest rates 
provision for income taxes we recorded million of income tax expense for the fiscal year ended june   compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal this increase was a result of our recording million of tax expense at june  to increase our valuation allowance to fully reserve our deferred tax assets that will not reverse against deferred tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period 
at the end of fiscal  we had reduced our valuation allowance and recorded an income tax benefit of million as we had determined that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future 
at june  we increased our valuation allowance to fully reserve our deferred tax assets that would not reverse against deferred tax liabilities within the scheduled reversal period based on management s assessment of evidence  including the net loss in fiscal in addition to the million of tax expense to increase our valuation allowance  we also recorded  of income tax expense during fiscal related to state taxes 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception through sales of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of our cooled thermotherapy system control units and single use treatment catheters 
as of june   we had total cash and cash equivalents of million compared to cash and cash equivalents of million as of june  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from our decreased sales in fiscal which contributed to a net operating loss of million in fiscal cash provided by operating activities during fiscal  we used million of cash from operating activities compared to the generation of million in fiscal primarily as a result of our net operating loss of million 
the net loss of million included non cash charges of million of impairment charges related to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets  million of depreciation and amortization expense  and  of stock based compensation expense  offset by a million non cash benefit from the reversal of the deferred tax liability 
changes in operating items contributed million of operating cash flow for the period with accounts receivable decreasing million as a result of lower sales and improved days sales outstanding  as well as an increase of  in accrued expenses and deferred income as a result of the sales tax accrual recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and increases in severance accruals for former company executives  partially offset by decreases in legal and audit accruals 
these increases in cash were partially offset by lower accounts payable of  due to the timing of purchases versus payments 
the decrease in accounts payable is due to the receipts and payments of vendor goods and services 
cash used for investing activities we used  for investing activities as a result of the purchase of property and equipment for leasehold improvements to our facilities and to support our manufacturing operations 

table of contents cash provided by financing activities during fiscal we generated  from financing activities as a result of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we plan to continue offering customers a variety of programs for both evaluation and longer term use of our cooled thermotherapy system control units in addition to purchase options  as well as grow our mobile service which provides physicians and patients with efficient access to our cooled thermotherapy system control units on a pre scheduled basis 
as of june   our property and equipment  net  included approximately million of control units used in evaluation or long term use programs and units used in our company owned mobile service 
depending on the growth of these programs  we may use additional capital to finance these programs 
future contractual commitments  including interest  that will affect cash flows are as follows in thousands building and equipment leases we believe our million in cash and cash equivalents at june  will be sufficient to fund our operations  working capital and capital resources needs for at least the next months 
in addition  we believe the majority of our cash equivalents are secure as they are backed by united states government treasures 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will not require additional financing in the future or that any additional financing will be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
fin creates a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions and clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
specifically under fin  the tax benefits from an uncertain tax position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based upon the technical merits of the position 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted fin effective july  as required 
the adoption of fin had no impact on our financial statements 
see note for further details on the adoption of fin in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards  except for measurements of share based payments and measurements that are similar to  but not intended to be  fair value 
this statement is expected to increase the consistency of fair value measurements  but imposes no requirements for additional fair value measures in financial statements 
the provisions under sfas no 
are effective for us beginning on july  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have any impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fsp no 
is effective for us beginning july  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have any impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash equivalents instruments 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases  respectively  in the fair value of these instruments 
also  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by the credit worthiness of the issuer  prepayment options  relative values of alternative instruments  the liquidity of the instrument and other general market conditions 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates and was not materially different from the quarter end carrying value 
due to the nature of our cash equivalent instruments  we have concluded that we do not have a material market risk exposure 
our policy is not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not have any significant foreign currency exposure since we do not generally transact business in foreign currencies 
therefore  we do not have significant overall currency exposure 
in addition  we do not enter into any futures or forward commodity contracts since we do not have significant market risk exposure with respect to commodity prices
