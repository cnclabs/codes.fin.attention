item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations american biltrite s consolidated financial statements include its majority owned subsidiary  congoleum 
however  under the terms of the joint plan  abi s ownership interest in congoleum would be eliminated 
abi expects its ownership interest in congoleum to be eliminated under any alternate plan or outcome in congoleum s chapter case 
on december   congoleum filed a voluntary petition with the bankruptcy court seeking relief under chapter of the bankruptcy code as a means to resolve claims asserted against it related to the use of asbestos in its products decades ago 
during  congoleum had obtained the requisite votes of asbestos personal injury claimants necessary to seek approval of a proposed  pre packaged chapter plan of reorganization 
in january  congoleum filed its proposed joint plan of reorganization and disclosure statement with the bankruptcy court 
from that filing through  several subsequent plans were negotiated with representatives of the acc  the fcr and other asbestos claimant representatives 
in addition  an insurance company  cna  filed a plan of reorganization and the bondholders committee also filed a plan of reorganization 
in may  the bankruptcy court ordered the principal parties in interest in congoleum s reorganization proceedings to participate in reorganization plan mediation discussions 
several mediation sessions took place during  culminating in two competing plans  one which congoleum filed jointly with the acc in september and the other filed by cna  both of which the bankruptcy court subsequently ruled were not confirmable as a matter of law 
in march  congoleum resumed global plan mediation discussions with the various parties seeking to resolve the issues raised in the bankruptcy court s ruling with respect to the tenth plan 
in july  the fcr filed a plan of reorganization and proposed disclosure statement 
after extensive further mediation sessions  on february   the fcr  the acc  the bondholders committee and congoleum jointly filed the joint plan 
the bankruptcy court approved the disclosure statement for the joint plan in february  and a confirmation hearing is scheduled for june  there can be no assurance that the joint plan or any other plan will receive the acceptances necessary for confirmation  that the joint plan will not be modified further  that the conditions to the joint plan or any other plan will be satisfied or waived  that the joint plan or any other plan will timely receive necessary court approvals from the bankruptcy court and the district court  that the joint plan or any other plan will be confirmed  that the joint plan or any other plan  if confirmed  will become effective  or that congoleum will have sufficient funds to pay for continued litigation over any plan of reorganization and the state court coverage litigation 
any other plan of reorganization that may be proposed for congoleum may contain terms substantially different from those contained in the joint plan 
abi estimates that it will spend an additional thousand for legal fees in  which it has accrued  in connection with congoleum s reorganization plan 
actual costs for pursuing and implementing the joint plan or any plan of reorganization could be materially higher  and congoleum and the company may record significant additional charges should the minimum estimated cost increase 
in addition  abi is also a defendant in a number of asbestos related lawsuits in addition to those brought against congoleum 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k  which is incorporated herein by reference 
these matters could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
during  the company decided to discontinue the operations of its janus flooring corporation subsidiary  a manufacturer of pre finished hardwood flooring  and sell the related assets 
results of janus flooring  including charges resulting from the shutdown  are being reported as a discontinued operation 
during  the remaining assets of janus flooring were sold  and the discontinued operation was effectively dissolved 
as of december   the company merged janus flooring with and into american biltrite canada ltd 
due to congoleum s reorganization and separate capital structure  as well as the anticipated elimination of abi s ownership interest in congoleum  the company believes that presenting the results of operations of abi and its non debtor subsidiaries separately from those of congoleum is the most meaningful way to discuss and analyze its financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations abi and non debtor subsidiaries in thousands of dollars net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general administrative expenses operating loss income interest expense  net other income  net loss income before taxes and other items benefit from provision for income taxes noncontrolling interests loss income from continuing operations net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of thousand from sales of million in tape segment sales decreased million or due to lower sales volume  partly offset by million in selling price increases 
in  a large automotive film customer switched their business to a competitor  and a large hvac tape customer produced for itself certain tapes previously supplied by the tape division  these two matters accounted for the majority of the lower sales volume 
canadian segment sales increased million or due to the result of foreign currency translation  as well as increased sales of luxury tile and cured rubber products 
jewelry segment sales improved million or due to higher sales to mass merchandisers 
gross profit was of net sales in compared to in tape segment gross margins improved by percentage points of net sales primarily due to the impact of million in costs incurred for a product recall necessitated by defective material from a supplier on gross margins 
excluding the impact of the product recall  margins decreased by percentage points of net sales as the impact of lower production volumes more than offset the benefit of manufacturing efficiency improvements 
canadian division gross margins declined by percentage points of net sales due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar during the year 
although the canadian division s us dollar sales and purchases are approximately the same  the canadian division uses a first in  first out method of costing inventory  and as a result  exchange rate fluctuations are reflected in sales more quickly than in cost of sales 
jewelry segment margins decreased by percentage points of net sales due to higher costs for goods and freight  partly offset by lower royalty costs 
the company includes the cost of purchasing and finished goods inspection in selling  general and administrative expenses 
some companies also record such costs in operating expenses while others record them in cost of goods sold 
consequently  the company s gross profit margins may not be comparable to other companies 
had the company recorded these expenses in cost of sales  the gross profit margins for the years ended december  and would have been and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  up from million in selling  general and administrative expenses increased at canadian division due to the impact of foreign currency exchange on these expenses and increased at the tape division due to additional selling expenses 
canadian division segment selling  general and administrative expenses also benefitted from receipt of a million class action settlement in jewelry segment selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million from to due to cost reduction programs 
during  abi increased the estimate of its share of the environmental remediation costs for a previously owned property and recorded a million charge  which also contributed to the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses over net interest expense of million for was approximately the same compared to other income increased from million in to million in as a result of a charge of thousand in other expense in for prepayment costs in connection with refinancing a note 
the effective tax rates of and for and  respectively  are due primarily to the effect of combining various segments with differing statutory rates applied to pretax losses in certain locations and pretax income in other locations 
american biltrite s us operations and foreign branches incurred a pretax loss of million for and million in the tax benefits recorded for the losses were thousand and thousand for and  respectively 
the company s canadian operation had a pretax loss of million for and pretax income of million for a benefit of thousand and a provision of thousand were recorded by the canadian operations for and  respectively 
during  the canadian operations recognized a benefit as a result of a change in valuation allowance against net operating loss carryforwards from janus 
the combined pretax loss of million and net tax benefit of million for resulted in an effective tax rate of 
the combined pretax income and net tax provision of thousand and thousand  respectively  resulted in an effective rate of for the company incurred a loss of million from continuing operations for compared with income of million in as a result of the lower income from operations in versus  partly offset by the increase in other income and the tax benefit recognized in congoleum in thousands of dollars net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general administrative expenses asbestos related reorganization expenses operating loss income bond interest reversal expense interest income expense  net other expense income  net income loss before taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net loss income net sales for the year ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in sales was primarily attributable to declines in new home construction  softness in the remodeling market and lower production of homes in the manufactured housing segment 
the impact of these sales decreases were partially mitigated by continued sales growth in the duraproduct category and the impact of price increases instituted in mid gross profit for the year ended december  totaled million  or of net sales  compared to million or of net sales for the year ended december  gross profit for the year was essentially the same year over year  as raw material costs and the unfavorable impact of unabsorbed manufacturing overhead due to lower volumes were offset by price increases and manufacturing cost reduction programs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses reflects cost reduction programs  including headcount reductions  instituted in early as a percent of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended december and  respectively 
given the terms of the proposed joint plan  in the fourth quarter of congoleum recorded an additional million charge 
of this charge  million related to the write off of certain insurance litigation costs receivable that will not be collected by congoleum under the terms of the joint plan if it is confirmed and effective  and million was an additional provision for estimated costs for the reorganization proceedings and coverage litigation 
in the fourth quarter of congoleum also recorded a million interest expense credit to reverse post petition interest accrued on its senior notes 
income from operations  excluding the special charge above  was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the prior year  an increase of million 
this increase in operating income primarily reflects the reduction in operating expenses 
operating income for the year ended december  included a million gain  included in selling  general and administrative expenses  on the replacement of a damaged production line that was covered by insurance 
interest income was million and 
million in and  respectively  with the increase of 
million versus the prior year reflecting interest earned on federal income tax refunds and higher cash balances 
interest expense  excluding interest on the senior notes  for was million as compared to interest expense of million for bond interest reversal on the senior notes in was million as compared to interest expense on senior notes in of million 
congoleum recorded a provision for income taxes of million in  reflecting an increase in non deductible expenses for tax return purposes 
for  congoleum recorded a benefit of million  reflecting the reversal of previously established reserves in connection with a closing agreement with the internal revenue service for tax return years to liquidity and capital resources abi and non debtor subsidiaries cash and cash equivalents  including short term investments  increased by million to million at december  as compared to december  working capital at december  was million  compared with million at december  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities at december  was compared to at december   consistent with the increased amount of working capital at december  net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was due to a million reduction in inventory during compared with an increase in inventory of million in  as well as less cash used to settle payables and accrued liabilities in versus these factors were partly offset by lower net income and a greater increase in accounts receivable in versus capital expenditures for were million compared to million for during the second quarter of  the company completed the sale of a building and land owned by the company s former subsidiary  janus flooring  a discontinued operation  for million canadian dollars 
the company received net cash proceeds of thousand canadian  which was used to reduce borrowings  and a note for million canadian 
payment of the note is due within days of receipt of an environmental certification on the land sold  which the company received on march  the company has recorded provisions which it believes are adequate for environmental remediation  including provisions for testing and potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities  and non asbestos product related liabilities 
while the company believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable  that most of such amounts will be paid over a period of one to ten years and that the company expects to have sufficient resources to fund such amounts  the actual timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from the company s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on the company s costs  the company is not aware of any pending legislation or regulation relating to these matters that would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position 
there can be no assurances that any such costs could be passed along to its customers 
american biltrite inc s primary source of borrowings are the revolving credit facility the revolver and the term loan term loan it has with bank of america  national association bofa and bofa acting through its canada branch the canadian lender pursuant to an amended and restated credit agreement the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides american biltrite inc and its subsidiary k m with i a million commitment under the revolver with a million borrowing sublimit the canadian revolver for american biltrite inc s subsidiary ab canada and ii a million term loan 
the credit agreement also provides for domestic and canadian letter of credit facilities with availability of up to million and million  respectively  subject to availability under the revolver and the canadian revolver  respectively 
in september  american biltrite inc entered into an amendment and restatement to the credit agreement with bofa and the canadian lender 
pursuant to the amendment and restatement  the term loan was added to the credit agreement and the amount of the revolver was increased by million to its current million amount 
in addition  the availability for domestic letters of credit issued under the credit agreement was increased from million to million 
in connection with that amendment and restatement  american biltrite inc used approximately million of new borrowings from the proceeds of the term loan  which was fully drawn  and under the revolver to fully prepay million of aggregate outstanding principal amount of the company s senior notes  all of which were held by the prudential insurance company of america  together with approximately million in interest and yield maintenance fees in connection with those notes and prepayment 
a charge of approximately thousand for early extinguishment of debt was recorded in connection with this prepayment  which is included in other expense 
the amount of borrowings available from time to time for american biltrite inc and k m under the revolver may not exceed the lesser of a million less the then outstanding amount of borrowings by ab canada under the canadian revolver less any outstanding borrowings under the domestic letter of credit facility and b the applicable borrowing base 
the formula used for determining the domestic borrowing base is based upon inventory  receivables and fixed assets of the company and certain of its subsidiaries not including  among others  ab canada and congoleum  reduced by amounts outstanding under the term loan 
the amount of borrowings available from time to time for ab canada under the canadian revolver is limited to the lesser of a million less any outstanding borrowings under the canadian letter of credit facility  b ab canada s borrowing base amount  which is based upon ab canada s accounts receivable  inventory and fixed assets  and c million less the amount of domestic borrowings outstanding under the revolver on behalf of the company and k m 
ab canada may borrow amounts under the canadian revolver in united states or canadian dollar denominations  however  solely for purposes of determining amounts outstanding and borrowing availability under the revolver  all canadian dollar denominated amounts will be converted into united states dollars in the manner provided in the credit agreement 
interest is payable quarterly on the term loan and revolver borrowings by american biltrite inc and k m under the credit agreement at rates which vary depending on the applicable interest rate in effect and are generally determined based upon a if a libor based rate is in effect  at a rate between a libor based rate plus to a libor based rate plus  depending on the company s leverage ratio  as determined under the credit agreement  b if a fixed rate is in effect  at a rate between the fixed rate plus to a fixed rate plus  depending on the company s leverage ratio  as determined under the credit agreement  and c for loans not based on a libor or fixed rate  the higher of i bofa s applicable prime rate and ii plus the federal funds rate  as determined under the credit agreement 
under the credit agreement  american biltrite inc and k m may generally determine whether interest on domestic revolving loans will be calculated based on a libor based rate  and if bofa elects to make a fixed rate option available  whether interest on revolving loans will be calculated based on a fixed rate 
interest is payable quarterly on revolving loans under the canadian revolver at rates which vary depending on the applicable interest rate in effect and are generally determined based upon a if a libor based rate is in effect  at a rate between a libor based rate plus to a libor based rate plus  depending on the company s leverage ratio  as determined under the credit agreement  and b if a libor based rate is not in effect  for outstanding revolving loans denominated in canadian dollars  the higher of i plus the applicable day average bankers acceptance rate as quoted on reuters cdor page and ii the canadian lender s applicable prime rate for loans made in canadian dollars to canadian customers  and for outstanding revolving loans denominated in united states dollars  the higher of i plus the federal funds rate as calculated under the credit agreement and ii the applicable rate announced by the canadian lender as its reference rate for commercial loans denominated in united states dollars made to a person in canada 
under the credit agreement  ab canada may generally determine whether interest on canadian revolving loans will be calculated based on a libor based rate 
american biltrite inc has entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the libor rate component of the term loan and million of the revolver at and respectively 
the term loan principal is payable in quarterly installments of thousand beginning december  and ending on september  all indebtedness under the credit agreement  other than the term loan  is due on september  the credit agreement contains certain covenants that the company must satisfy 
the covenants included in the credit agreement include certain financial tests  restrictions on the ability of the company to incur additional indebtedness or to grant liens on its assets and restrictions on the ability of the company to pay dividends on its capital stock 
the financial tests are required to be calculated based on the company accounting for its majority owned subsidiary congoleum on the equity method and include a maximum ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth  a minimum ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda less certain cash payments for taxes  debt service  and dividends to interest expense  a minimum level of tangible net worth  and a maximum level of capital spending 
pursuant to the amendment and restatement to the credit agreement entered into on september   certain of the financial covenants under the credit agreement were amended to  among other things  i increase the permitted ratio of the company s consolidated total liabilities to consolidated tangible net worth to  ii to provide for a higher threshold for satisfying the consolidated tangible net worth test and iii to provide a higher permitted aggregate amount for capital expenditures in any fiscal year 
the credit agreement also requires  for each fiscal quarter ending on and after september   the company s consolidated adjusted ebitda for the four consecutive fiscal quarters then ending to exceed of the company s consolidated fixed charges for the month period ending on such date  as determined under the credit agreement 
pursuant to the credit agreement  the company and certain of its subsidiaries previously granted bofa and the canadian lender a security interest in most of the company s and its subsidiaries assets 
the security interest granted does not include shares of capital stock of congoleum or the assets of congoleum 
in addition  pursuant to the credit agreement  certain of the company s subsidiaries have agreed to guarantee the company s obligations excluding ab canada s obligations under the credit agreement 
in the past  the company has had to amend its debt agreements in order to avoid being in default of those agreements as a result of failing to satisfy certain financial covenants contained in those agreements 
at march   the company was not in compliance with the financial covenant under the credit agreement that there be no consecutive quarterly net losses from continuing operations 
on may   american biltrite inc and its subsidiaries  k m and ab canada  entered into an amendment  effective as of march   to the credit agreement with bofa and bofa acting through its canada branch  each in their respective capacities as lenders and administrative agents under the credit agreement 
the amendment revised that financial covenant to provide that for each of the two consecutive fiscal quarters of the company ending december  and march   the company may not have a quarterly net loss from continuing operations in excess of thousand 
the company was in compliance with the financial covenants of its debt agreements at june and september  at december   the company was not in compliance with the financial covenant under the credit agreement that requires a ratio of adjusted ebitda to consolidated interest expense as such terms are defined in the credit agreement to exceed and that there be no consecutive quarterly net losses from continuing operations 
on march   american biltrite inc and its subsidiaries  k m and ab canada  entered into an amendment  effective as of december   to the credit agreement with bofa and bofa acting through its canada branch  each in their respective capacities as lenders and administrative agents under the credit agreement 
the amendment removed the financial covenant that required the company not to have any consecutive quarterly net losses from continuing operations 
in addition  for purposes of determining the company s compliance with the financial covenant requiring its consolidated adjusted ebitda to exceed of the company s consolidated fixed charges in each case  as determined under the credit agreement  the amendment permits the company to add certain amounts to its consolidated adjusted ebitda to the extent those amounts are deducted in determining the company s consolidated net income as determined under the credit agreement 
further  under that amendment  the lenders waived defaults that may have otherwise existed as of december  with respect to the financial covenants that were amended by the amendment 
as of december   american biltrite was in compliance with the financial covenants of the credit agreement as amended by the may  amendment 
abi paid bofa a fee of thousand in connection with this amendment 
while the company does not currently anticipate that it will need to further amend its existing debt agreements to avoid being in default at some future date  there can be no assurances in that regard  and any required amendments  if obtained  could result in significant cost to the company 
if a default were to occur and the company was unable to obtain a waiver from bofa  the company would be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the credit agreement and the company would need to obtain funding from another source 
otherwise  the company would likely be unable to repay those outstanding amounts  in which case  bofa might exercise its rights over the collateral 
any default by the company of the credit agreement that resulted in the company being required to immediately repay outstanding amounts under the credit agreements  and for which suitable replacement financing were not timely obtained  would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
under the terms of the joint plan  abi s ownership interest in congoleum would be eliminated 
abi expects that its ownership interest in congoleum would be eliminated under any alternate plan or outcome in congoleum s chapter case 
while the company does not believe the loss of the value of its equity interest in congoleum would have a direct material adverse effect on abi s liquidity  the loss of a controlling interest could have a material adverse impact on the business relationships between abi and congoleum  which in turn could have a material adverse impact on abi s business  operations and financial condition 
in connection with congoleum s plan of reorganization  abi expects to spend thousand in  which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on abi s working capital or cash flow 
the company has not declared a dividend subsequent to the third quarter of future dividends  if any  will be determined by the company s board of directors based upon the financial performance and capital requirements of the company  among other considerations 
under the credit agreement  aggregate dividend payments since june  are generally limited to of cumulative consolidated net income computed treating congoleum under the equity method of accounting  as determined under the credit agreement  earned from june  liquidity and capital resources congoleum the consolidated financial statements of congoleum  which are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k  have been prepared on a going concern basis 
a going concern basis contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
accordingly  the consolidated financial statements of congoleum do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should congoleum be unable to continue as a going concern 
as described more fully in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k  there is substantial doubt about congoleum s ability to continue as a going concern unless it obtains relief from its substantial asbestos liabilities through a successful reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
on december   congoleum filed a voluntary petition with the bankruptcy court case no 
seeking relief under the bankruptcy code 
see notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  which are set forth in item of this annual report on form k  for a discussion of congoleum s bankruptcy proceedings 
these matters continue to have a material adverse impact on congoleum s liquidity and capital resources 
during  congoleum paid million in fees and expenses net of recoveries related to reorganization proceedings under chapter and litigation with certain insurance companies 
congoleum expects to spend an additional million in on these matters 
at december  congoleum had incurred but not paid approximately million in additional fees and expenses for services rendered through that date 
given the terms of the joint plan  congoleum has made provision in its financial statements for the minimum estimated cost to effect its plan to settle asbestos liabilities through confirmation of a plan that complies with section g of the bankruptcy code 
congoleum recorded charges aggregating approximately million in prior years 
given the terms of the proposed joint plan  in the fourth quarter of congoleum recorded an additional million charge 
of this charge  million related to the write off of certain insurance litigation costs receivable that will not be collected under the terms of the joint plan if it is confirmed and effective  and million was an additional provision for estimated costs for the reorganization proceedings and coverage litigation 
in the fourth quarter of  congoleum also recorded a million interest expense credit to reverse post petition interest accrued on its senior notes 
terms of previous reorganization plans had provided  among other things  for the payment of post petition interest on the senior notes and therefore congoleum had continued to accrue such interest 
under the terms of the joint plan  the holders of the senior notes will not receive any post petition interest 
in february  the bankruptcy court ordered congoleum s former counsel  gilbert  heintz randolph llp currently known as gilbert randolph llp ghr to disgorge all fees and certain expenses it was paid by congoleum 
the amount of the disgorgement is approximately million 
in october  congoleum and ghr entered into a settlement agreement under which ghr is to pay congoleum approximately million plus accruing interest in full satisfaction of the disgorgement order 
the payment is secured by assets of ghr and is to be made over time according to a formula based on ghr s earnings 
the bankruptcy court approved that settlement agreement in april payments received by congoleum pursuant to that settlement agreement in were not significant 
unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  including short term investments at december   were million  an increase of million from december  under the terms of its revolving credit agreement  payments on congoleum s accounts receivable are deposited in an account assigned by congoleum to its lender and the funds in that account are used by the lender to pay down any loan balance 
funds deposited in this account but not yet applied to the loan balance  which amounted to million and million at december  and december   respectively  are recorded as restricted cash 
additionally  million remaining from a million settlement received in august from an insurance carrier  which is subject to a court order  is included as restricted cash at december  congoleum expects to contribute these funds  less any amounts withheld pursuant to reimbursement arrangements  to the plan trust to be established following confirmation of the joint plan 
working capital was million at december   down from million one year earlier 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  compared to at december  net cash provided by operations during the year ended december  was million  as compared to net used in operations of million in capital expenditures in totaled million 
congoleum is currently planning capital expenditures of approximately million in and between million and million in  primarily for maintenance and improvement of plants and equipment  which it expects to fund with cash from operations and credit facilities 
in january  the bankruptcy court authorized entry of a final order approving congoleum s debtor in possession financing  which replaced its pre petition credit facility on substantially similar terms 
the debtor in possession financing agreement as amended and approved by the bankruptcy court to date provides a revolving credit facility expiring on i the earlier of june  and ii the date the plan of reorganization in congoleum s bankruptcy cases as confirmed by the bankruptcy court becomes effective 
total borrowing under the facility may not exceed million 
interest is based on above the prime rate 
this financing agreement contains certain covenants  which include the maintenance of minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
it also includes restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt and limitations on capital expenditures 
the covenants and conditions under this financing agreement must be met in order for congoleum to borrow from the facility 
congoleum was in compliance with these covenants at december  borrowings under this facility are collateralized by inventory and receivables 
at december   based on the level of receivables and inventory  million was available under the facility  of which million was utilized for outstanding letters of credit and million was utilized by the revolving loan 
congoleum anticipates that its debtor in possession financing facility including anticipated extensions thereof together with cash from operations  will provide it with sufficient liquidity to operate during while under chapter protection 
there can be no assurances that congoleum will continue to be in compliance with the required covenants under this facility or that the debtor in possession facility as extended will be renewed prior to its expiration if a plan of reorganization is not confirmed before that time 
for a plan of reorganization to be confirmed  congoleum will need to obtain and demonstrate the sufficiency of financing needed to effectuate the plan and emerge from its chapter case 
congoleum cannot presently determine the terms of any such financing it might obtain  nor can there be any assurances of its success obtaining it 
in addition to the provision for asbestos litigation discussed previously  congoleum has also recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities other than asbestos related claims  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
congoleum is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations and certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against congoleum 
among these claims  congoleum is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites more fully discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites and certain of congoleum s owned and previously owned facilities 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
the exact amount of such future cost and timing of payments are indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of congoleum s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties  and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
congoleum has recorded provisions in its financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known general and environmental contingencies 
while congoleum believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable  and that they will be paid over a period of five to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from congoleum s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on congoleum s costs  congoleum is not aware of any pending legislation which would reasonably have such an effect 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along by congoleum to its customers 
estimated insurance recoveries related to these liabilities are reflected in other non current assets 
the outcome of these environmental matters could result in significant expenses incurred by or judgments assessed against congoleum 
congoleum s principal sources of capital are net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under its financing agreement 
congoleum cannot presently determine the amount of fees  expenses  and trust contributions it may incur in connection with obtaining confirmation of its plan of reorganization 
congoleum believes that its existing cash including restricted cash  cash generated from operations  and debtor in possession credit arrangements should be sufficient to provide adequate working capital for operations during congoleum s ability to emerge from chapter will depend on obtaining sufficient exit financing to settle administrative expenses of the reorganization and any other related obligations  and to provide adequate future liquidity 
contingencies abi has recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
while abi believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable and that they will be paid for the most part over a period of one to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from abi s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on abi s costs  abi is not aware of any pending legislation which could significantly affect the liabilities abi has established for these matters 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along by abi to its customers 
certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against abi 
among these claims  abi is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites and asbestos related claims 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites 
the exact amount of such future costs to abi is indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of cleanup costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of abi s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
abi has recorded provisions in its consolidated financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known environmental and asbestos related contingencies 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
see notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results and conditions may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that its most critical accounting policies upon which its financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are those described below 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements set forth in item of this annual report on form k 
asbestos liabilities as discussed previously  the company is party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from their previous manufacture of asbestos containing products 
abi has recorded in its consolidated balance sheet a liability and corresponding insurance receivable based on its estimates of the future costs and related insurance recoveries to settle asbestos litigation and pay for related legal and loss handling costs 
these estimates are based on a number of subjective assumptions  including the anticipated costs to settle claims  the claims dismissal rate  the cost to litigate claims  the number of claims expected to be received  and the applicability and allocation of insurance coverage to these costs 
additionally  due to the numerous uncertainties related to future asbestos litigation trends and costs  the company does not believe reasonable estimates can be developed for claim developments beyond a six year horizon 
accordingly  the company s estimated liability is based on claims currently filed as well as claims anticipated to be filed over the next six years 
a change in assumptions could have a material effect on the company s estimated liability 
for example  it is estimated that a decrease in the company s dismissal rate would result in a increase in liability assuming all other variables remained constant 
due to the highly subjective nature of these assumptions  the company has estimated a wide range of potential future costs and insurance recoveries and  because management believes that no amount within the range is more likely than any other  has recorded a liability and insurance receivable based on the low end of the range in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  the selection of a different amount within the range could have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements  as could future developments  which may differ from those assumed in developing the company s estimates 
the same factors that affect developing forecasts of potential indemnity costs for asbestos related liabilities also affect estimates of the total amount of insurance that is probable of recovery  as do a number of additional factors 
these additional factors include the financial viability of some of the insurance companies  the method in which losses will be allocated to the various insurance policies and the years covered by those policies  how legal and other loss handling costs will be covered by the insurance policies  and interpretation of the effect on coverage of various policy terms and limits and their interrelationships 
the company analyzes these estimates on an annual basis and reassesses the assumptions used as additional information becomes available over the course of time 
congoleum is a party to a significant number of lawsuits stemming from its manufacture of asbestos containing products 
during  congoleum paid million net of recoveries in fees and expenses related to implementation of its planned reorganization under chapter of the bankruptcy code and litigation with certain insurance companies 
given the terms of the proposed joint plan  congoleum has made provision in its financial statements for the minimum estimated cost to effect its plan to settle asbestos liabilities through confirmation of a plan that complies with section g of the bankruptcy code 
congoleum recorded charges aggregating approximately million in prior years 
given the terms of the proposed joint plan  in the fourth quarter of congoleum recorded an additional million charge 
of this charge  million related to the write off of certain insurance litigation costs receivable that will not be collected by congoleum under the terms of the joint plan if it is confirmed and effective  and million was an additional provision for estimated costs for the reorganization proceedings and coverage litigation 
in the fourth quarter of congoleum also recorded a million interest expense credit to reverse post petition interest accrued on its senior notes 
terms of previous reorganization plans had provided  among other things  for the payment of post petition interest on the senior notes and therefore congoleum had continued to accrue such interest 
under the terms of the joint plan  the holders of the senior notes will not receive any post petition interest 
in anticipation of congoleum s commencement of the chapter cases  congoleum entered into the claimant agreement  which provides for settlement of certain prepetition asbestos claims against congoleum and provides for an aggregate settlement value of at least million as well as an additional number of individually negotiated trial listed settlements with an aggregate value of approximately million  for total settlements in excess of million 
participants in the claimant agreement signed releases limiting their recourse against congoleum to what they would receive from the plan trust and congoleum has therefore estimated its liability under the claimant agreement as the cost of effecting the settlement through confirmation of a plan of reorganization 
in addition  as a result of tabulating ballots on a previous plan  congoleum is also aware of claims by claimants whose claims were not determined under the claimant agreement but who have submitted claims with a value of approximately million based on the settlement values applicable in a previous plan 
it is also likely that additional new claims will be asserted in connection with solicitation of acceptances of the joint plan 
congoleum does not believe it can reasonably estimate the liability associated with claims that may be pending 
abi understands that congoleum expects that insurance will provide the substantial majority of the recovery available to claimants  due to the amount of insurance coverage it purchased and the comparatively limited resources and value of congoleum itself 
congoleum does not have the necessary financial resources to litigate and or settle asbestos claims in the ordinary course of business 
while congoleum has provided for the anticipated costs to effect the joint plan  costs for pursuing and implementing the joint plan and any plan of reorganization could be materially higher than recorded amounts and previous estimates 
congoleum will update its estimates  if appropriate  as additional information becomes available during the reorganization process  which could result in potentially material adjustments to congoleum s earnings in future periods 
consolidation of congoleum the company s subsidiary congoleum filed for bankruptcy protection on december  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the results for congoleum for all periods presented 
abi expects to continue to own a majority of the voting stock of congoleum until congoleum s reorganization proceedings are concluded  at which time abi expects it shares of congoleum will be cancelled 
the company has elected to continue to consolidate the financial statements of congoleum in its consolidated results because it believes that is the appropriate presentation given its current voting control of congoleum 
however  the accompanying financial statements also present the details of consolidation to separately show the financial condition  operating results and cash flows of abi including its non debtor subsidiaries and congoleum  which may be more meaningful for certain analyses 
abi s reported consolidated financial condition  operating results and cash flows results would be materially different if they did not include congoleum 
the company anticipates its equity interest in congoleum will be eliminated in connection with the effectiveness of any future congoleum plan of reorganization  at which time it will no longer include congoleum in the company s consolidated financial statements 
environmental contingencies as discussed previously  the company has incurred liabilities related to environmental remediation costs at both third party sites and company owned sites 
the company accrues for its estimate of future remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including the extent of clean up activities to be performed  the methods employed in the clean up activities  the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  existing technology  current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience 
where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another  the minimum is accrued 
for sites with multiple potentially responsible parties  the company considers its likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs 
when future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage or payment from third parties  an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded related to the expected recovery 
a receivable reserve is recorded when recoveries are disputed or are not highly probable 
these estimates are based on certain assumptions such as the company s relative share in costs at sites where other parties are involved  and the ultimate insurance coverage available 
these projects tend to be long term in nature  and assumptions are subject to refinement as facts change 
as such  it is possible that the company may need to revise its recorded liabilities and receivables for environmental costs in future periods resulting in potentially material adjustments to the company s earnings in future periods 
the company closely monitors existing and potential environmental matters to consider the reasonableness of its estimates and assumptions 
valuation of deferred tax assets the company provides for valuation reserves against its deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of sfas in evaluating the recovery of deferred tax assets  the company makes certain assumptions as to the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  taxable income in prior carryback years  the feasibility of tax planning strategies  and estimated future taxable income 
the valuation allowance can be affected by changes to tax laws  changes to statutory tax rates and changes to future taxable income estimates 
it is possible that the facts underlying these assumptions may not materialize as anticipated in future periods  which may require the company to record additional deferred tax valuation allowances  or to reduce previously recorded valuation allowances 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company sponsors several noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering most of the company s employees 
the company also maintains health and life insurance programs for retirees 
benefits under the plans are based on years of service and employee compensation 
the costs and obligations associated with these plans are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include the long term rate of return on plan assets  discount rates and other factors 
these assumptions are evaluated and updated annually by management 
other assumptions used include employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns  mortality  turnover and the rate of compensation increases 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the company considers the current and expected asset allocation  as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class 
in and  the company assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be 
the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over four years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in pension expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past actuarial gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pension expense 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities 
the discount rate is used to determine expected future benefit payments as a present value on the measurement date  reflecting the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the company determined this rate to be 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a variety of factors that affect the potential collectibility of the related receivables  including the length of time receivables are past due  customer credit ratings  financial stability of customers  specific one time events and past customer history 
in addition  in circumstances where the company is made aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance is established 
the majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the criteria previously noted 
the remainder of the reserve is based on management s estimates and takes into consideration historical trends  market conditions and the composition of the company s customer base 
the risk associated with this estimate is that the company would not become aware of potential collectibility issues related to specific accounts and thereby become exposed to potential unreserved losses 
historically  the company s estimates and assumptions around the allowance have been reasonably accurate and the company has processes and controls in place to closely monitor customers and potential credit issues 
inventory allowances the company maintains obsolescence and slow moving allowances for inventory 
products and materials that are specifically identified as obsolete are fully reserved 
the remainder of the allowance is based on management s estimates and fluctuates with market conditions  design cycles and other economic factors 
risks associated with this allowance include unforeseen changes in business cycles that could affect the marketability of certain products and an unforecasted decline in current production 
management closely monitors the market place and related inventory levels and has historically maintained reasonably accurate allowance levels 
in addition  the company values certain inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
accordingly  a lifo valuation reserve is maintained to properly value these inventories
