item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing at the end of this annual report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our financial condition and results of operations may change as a result of many factors  including those we discuss in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report and our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
overview we are developing and commercializing innovative regenerative protein therapeutic device combination products that we believe have the potential to significantly improve the treatment of musculoskeletal injuries and conditions affecting bones  tendons  ligaments and cartilage 
our platform regenerative technology  which incorporates a synthetic and potent version of one of the body s natural key stimulators of tissue repair  may offer physicians and dentists the advanced biological solutions to actively stimulate tissue healing and regeneration 
we have already demonstrated that this technology is safe and effective in stimulating bone and periodontal regeneration in the jaws with the us and canadian regulatory approvals of our first product  gem s growth factor enhanced matrix 
we also have reported that the results of early clinical trials and pre clinical studies suggest that this technology is also effective in stimulating bone healing in orthopedic  and potentially spine and sports injury  applications 
we believe that our regenerative therapies will offer new  effective and less invasive treatment options to improve the quality of life for millions of patients suffering injuries or deterioration of bones  ligaments  tendons and cartilage 
we are developing a pipeline of product candidates that are based upon our platform technology used in our previously approved periodontal product  gem s 
these product candidates are designed to target a broad range of clinical indications in bone  cartilage  ligament and tendon repair 
we currently have seven clinical studies recently completed or currently under way  which seek to demonstrate the safety  clinical utility and or efficacy of our product candidates  including our lead product candidates gem os bone graft and gem os injectable bone graft  in treating bone defects and injuries 
in addition  we have pre clinical programs focused on the development of treatments for bone defects in the spine and various sports injury applications  including those requiring cartilage  ligament and tendon repair 
our development strategy for our orthopedic product candidates is similar to the strategy that we used in the development of gem s  which received fda approval in november for the treatment of periodontal bone defects and gum tissue recession associated with periodontal disease 
this strategy was effective in that we were able to obtain product approval in less than five years 
in  we sold worldwide marketing and distribution rights for gem s to luitpold pharmaceuticals  inc luitpold  a us subsidiary of daiichi sankyo co  ltd 
in january  we sold to luitpold our remaining orofacial therapeutic business  whereas luitpold is granted the rights to the downstream formulation  fill  finish manufacturing and kitting of gem s 
this arrangement allows us to focus our expertise and our future development efforts on our orthopedic  spine and sports medicine product candidates  and provides additional capital allowing us to aggressively advance our pipeline of product candidates through clinical developm ent and into commercialization 
since inception in april  we have incurred losses each year 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
although the size and timing of our future operating losses are subject to significant uncertainty  we expect our operating losses to continue to increase over the next several years as we continue to fund our research and development activities and clinical trials and as we prepare for a future sales network to represent our products 
also  given our january sale of our remaining orofacial therapeutic business  we currently do not have an fda approved product currently in commercialization 
since inception  we have funded our operations 
table of contents from the sale of capital stock including redeemable preferred stock  our ipo in may and our secondary public offering in february  from the licensing and sale of our orofacial therapeutic business in january  and from research and development agreements  grants and product sales 
we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as we expand our operations  facilities and other activities 
furthermore  as we operate as a publicly traded company  we expect to incur additional costs  such as those related to the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase as a result of new and ongoing clinical trials and pre clinical studies in the united states  canada and the eu of our orthopedic product candidates  as well as continuing expenses associated with regulatory filings 
the following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the five years ended december  direct external costs represent significant expenses paid to third parties that specifically relate to our product candidates in clinical development  such as payments to contract research organizations  clinical investigators  manufacture of clinical material  consultants  contract manufacturing start up costs  manufacturing scale up costs  milestone payments and insurance premiums for clinical studies 
in addition  employee costs salaries  payroll taxes  benefits  and travel for employees of the manufacturing  regulatory affairs  quality assurance  quality control  research and development and clinical departments are classified as research and development costs 
research and development spending for past periods is not indicative of spending in future periods

we expect our research and development expenses to increase due to the substantial expansion of our internal research capabilities and due to the numbers of patients we expect to enroll in the clinical trials of our orthopedic product candidates and other product candidates 
we will make determinations as to which product candidates to advance and how much funding to direct to each on an ongoing basis in response to their scientific and clinical success 
the successful development of our product candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development and approval of  or the period in which material net cash flows are expected to commence from  any of our product candidates due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates  including the uncertainty of

recent developments construction commenced on new manufacturing facility in august  we entered into a new lease agreement with noblegene development llc noblegene for approximately  square feet of space within a new building  which is located in the same complex as our current headquarters in franklin  tennessee 
in december  noblegene commenced construction activities on this new building intended to house certain of our manufacturing operations once completed 
we intend to utilize the new space as a good manufacturing practices gmp manufacturing facility and will move certain of our manufacturing operations to the new space once it is completed 
this new facility will provide space to meet our current and projected needs for certain aspects of our manufacturing and product release testing for our product candidates 
in addition  the facility will provide for future expansion of office  lab  or manufacturing space and capabilities for other product candidates that we are developing 
asset purchase agreement in december  we entered into a definitive asset purchase agreement with luitpold to sell to luitpold our remaining orofacial therapeutic business 
the transaction closed in january under that agreement  luitpold is granted the rights to the downstream formulation  fill  finish manufacturing and kitting of gem s  along with all rights to the gem trademark family 
in addition  with regard to our future orthopedic and sports medicine products  luitpold is granted certain rights to adapt those products to dental applications 
luitpold currently markets the gem s product through its osteohealth company division 
we will receive million in cash as a result of the transaction  plus approximately million in cash from the sale of existing inventory  and ongoing royalty payments based on net sales of gem s and other products that are based on adapting our technology to future products in the orofacial therapeutic field 
in addition  in december  we received a time based million milestone payment for the second anniversary of the us marketing approval for gem s and will also receive a million payment based upon the future anticipated eu regulatory approval of gem s 
both payments were pre established in a prior agreement between us and luitpold 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses  fair valuation of inventory  valuation of any losses on purchase commitments  fair valuation of stock related to stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on authoritative literature and pronouncements  historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily 
table of contents apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
the results of our operations for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of the results of our operations for any other future period 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report  we believe that the following accounting policies relating to revenue recognition  research and development expense  inventory valuation  valuation of purchase commitments  accrued expenses and deferred liabilities  stock based compensation  income taxes and investments in marketable securities are significant and  therefore  important to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition we follow the revenue recognition criteria outlined in staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab  revenue recognition  emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
product sales revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product to the customer 
accordingly  up front  non refundable license fees under agreements where we have an ongoing research and development commitment are amortized  on a straight line basis  over the performance period 
revenues from milestones are only recognized upon achievement of the milestone criteria 
milestone payments received for sublicense fees are deferred and recognized into revenue on a straight line basis over the initial term of the sublicense 
revenues received for ongoing research and development activities under collaborative agreements are recognized as these activities are performed pursuant to the terms of the related agreements 
royalty revenues are received from our sublicensor in arrears based on sales by the sublicensor 
we recognize royalty income when we receive the sales information from luitpold 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
revenue related to grant awards is deferred and recognized as related research and development performance occurs 
research and development costs we expense costs associated with research and development activities as incurred 
we evaluate payments made to suppliers and other vendors in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  and determine the appropriate accounting treatment based on the nature of the services provided  the contractual terms  and the timing of the obligation 
research and development costs include payments to third parties that specifically relate to our product candidates in clinical development  such as payments to contract research organizations  clinical investigators  manufacture of clinical material  product related consultants  contract manufacturer start up costs  manufacturing scale up costs  milestone payments and insurance premiums for clinical studies 
in addition  employee costs salaries  payro ll taxes  benefits  and travel for employees of the manufacturing  regulatory affairs  quality assurance  quality control  and research and development departments are classified as research and development costs 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of our actual cost or the current estimated market value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and inventory commitments with suppliers and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our historical usage and anticipated future usage 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated change in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost first in  first out or net realizable value and consist of bulk drug substances and various components to be utilized in the manufacturing of our products 

table of contents finished goods consist of finished kits and filled syringes and cups that will be packaged in the finished kits to be sold to consumers 
inventory costs consist primarily of the purchase of raw materials  shipping costs associated with the transportation of raw materials to the contract manufacturer  fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of filled periodontal cups and syringes  kit packing fees  and quality control testing fees  less reserves for obsolescence  shrinkage and potential scrapping of product batches that may not be released for sale 
valuation of purchase commitments we have substantial firm purchase commitments with our suppliers related to our future inventory needs 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we assess the need for any provision for future losses associated with these future purchase commitments in accordance with accounting research bulletin arb no 
 restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins 
as of december   no reserves have been recorded associated with these future purchase commitments 
accrued expenses and deferred liabilities as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate expenses that we have incurred for which we have not been invoiced 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed by third parties and the associated cost incurred for such services where we have not been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs 
examples of expenses for which we accrue based on estimates include milestones payable  salaries and wages  unpaid vacation and sick pay  fees for services  such as those provided by clinical research and data management organizations  investigators and fees owed to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the manufacture of clinical trial materials 
in connection with such service fees  these estimates are most affected by management s projections of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
management makes these estimates based upon the facts and circumstances known to it at the time and in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
milestone payments due within months are considered short term liabilities and those due in over months are considered long term liabilities 
stock based compensation during  our board of directors approved the adoption of the long term stock incentive plan the option plan 
the option plan provides that stock options  other equity interests or equity based incentives in our company may be granted to key personnel at an exercise price determined by our compensation committee  at the time the option is granted  taking into account the fair value of the common stock at the date of grant 
the maximum term of any option granted pursuant to the option plan is ten years from the date of grant 
the stock options we granted to our employees are structured to qualify as incentive stock options  or isos 
under current tax regulations  we do not receive a tax deduction for the issuance  exercise or disposition of isos if the employee meets specific holding requirements 
if the employee does not meet the holding requirements  a disqualifying disposition occurs  at which time we will receive a tax deduction 
we do not record tax benefits related to isos unless and until a disqualifying disposition occurs 
in the event of a disqualifying disposition  the entire tax benefit is recorded as a reduction of income tax expense 
we have not recognized any income tax benefit for share based compensation arrangements due to the fact that we do not believe that we will recognize any deferred tax assets from such compensation cost recognized in the current period 

table of contents effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective method of transition 
under that transition method  compensation costs recognized in the years ended december  and include the costs for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
this is a change from prior periods as compensation costs for all share based payments granted prior to january  were calculated based on the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions amortized to expense over the options vesting periods for the year ended december  risk free interest rate of  expected dividend yield of  volatility factor of the expected market price of our common stock of  forfeiture rate of and weighted average expected life of the option of years 
since the trading market for our common stock has a limited history  the expected volatility and forfeiture rates are based on historical data from three companies similar in size and value to our company 
the expected terms of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding and is derived from the contractual terms of the options granted 
we amortize the fair value of each option over e ach option s vesting period 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
our net loss includes compensation costs related to our stock based compensation arrangements of million for the year ended december  no income tax benefit related to our stock based compensation arrangement is included in our net losses 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we had adopted sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 as amended  but in accordance with sfas no 
 we had elected not to apply fair value based accounting for our awards under the employee stock incentive plan through december  instead  we measured compensation expense for our stock plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion no 
 and related interpretations 
we recorded deferred stock based compensation to the extent the deemed fair value of our shares of common stock for financial accounting purposes exceeded the exercise price of stock options granted to employees on the date of grant  and amortized these amounts to expense over the vesting schedule of the options  gen erally four years 
at each grant date during and through the first quarter of  prior to our ipo  our board of directors determined the deemed fair value of our common stock and the associated exercise price of each award 
following each financing and the achievement by us of significant milestones  the board of directors reviewed the fair value of our common stock 
because there was no public market for our common stock at the time of such determinations and there has been no sale of common stock to a third party since inception  these determinations were necessarily subjective 
in connection with preparing the financial statements for our ipo  the board of directors reassessed the fair value of our common stock for the year ended december  and the first quarter of the board of directors performed its analysis and retrospective review in accordance with the practice aid issued by the american institute of certified public accountants titled valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation 
as required by sfas no 
 as modified by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of financial accounting standards board statement no 
 we provide disclosure of the effect of using the fair value based method of measuring stock based compensation expense for periods prior to january  since we were a private entity and had used the minimum value method in determining the estimated value of our common stock under sfas no 
 as amended 
for purposes of the disclosure  we have estimated the fair value of stock options issued to employees using the black scholes option valuation model 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method prescribed by the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided for the deferred tax assets related to future years  including loss carryforwards  if there is not sufficient evidence to indicate that the results of operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax asset in future years 
effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  to account for uncertain tax positions 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation prescribes that we should use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as a result of adopting fin  we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities  or any associated amounts for interest and penalties 
as a result  there was no effect on our financial condition or results of operations as of and for the year ended december  investments in marketable securities we invest in marketable securities  which are classified as available for sale 
these investments are stated at fair market value  with any unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains and losses and declines in market value judged to be other than temporary on investments in marketable securities are included in investment income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in investment income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   we had investments of million in marketable securities  which primarily represent the proceeds of the february secondary public offering 
we did not have any investments in marketable securities in we recorded investment income  including realized gains and losses  on our investment portfolio of million for the year ended december  at december   we had accrued interest receivables of million related to our investments in marketable securities 
at december   we did not have any unrealized gains or losses on available for sale securities 
we invest in auction rate securities and municipal bonds with aaa credit ratings 
the investments are classified as long term because we do not anticipate liquidating the investments over the next twelve months 
see additional discussion regarding the liquidity of the auction rate securities in liquidity and capital resources 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue

general and administrative expenses

table of contents increased research and development activities and clinical trials in the orthopedic program related to gem os and other product candidates  resulting in a million increase in professional fees and contract manufacturing expenses  and a net increase of new employees resulting in an increase of million of salaries and related benefits 
these increases  however  were offset by one time costs in the prior year  including a million supplier milestone which was payable upon fda approval and which was recorded in the fourth quarter of  and activities in manufacturing scale up costs for the production of gem s resulting in costs of million in general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  in the year ended december   we had a net increase of seven new employees in administrative and operations functions  resulting in an increase of million of salaries and related benefits

in the year ended december   we purchased manufacturing equipment  office equipment  furniture and fixtures and made leasehold improvements totaling million 
the increase in depreciation and capital lease amortization is attributable to these new purchases 
patent license fee amortization

net interest and investment income increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to higher cash and investment balances during the year ended december  this resulted from our may ipo which resulted in net proceeds of million after deducting underwriters commissions and related expenses 
provision for income taxes 
we incurred net operating losses for the years ended december  and  and  accordingly  we did not record a provision for income taxes 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of million that will begin to expire in in addition  we had federal minimum tax credits of million that will not expire 
state net operating loss carryforwards at december  totaled million and will expire between and liquidity and capital resources in february  we completed a secondary public offering of  shares of our common stock  which included  shares sold upon full exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
of the shares of common stock that were offered  we sold  shares of common stock and the remaining  shares of common stock were sold by certain selling stockholders 
all of the shares were sold at a price of per share 
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions of million million paid by us and million paid by the selling stockholders and other offering expenses of approximately million paid by us in connection with the offering  the net proceeds from the offering were approximately million to us and million to the selling stockholders 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling stockholders 
we have invested our net proceeds from the offering in auction rate securities and government bonds with aaa credit ratings 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents held in a local financial institution 
our excess cash reserves are invested in overnight sweep accounts  operating accounts  bank certificates of deposit  money market accounts and marketable securities 

table of contents as of december   we have investments of million in marketable securities 
we invest in auction rate securities and municipal bonds with aaa credit ratings 
substantially all of our auction rate security investments are bonds sold by state guarantee agencies backed by student loans under the federal family education loan program ffelp 
the student loans are guaranteed by the us department of education at amounts representing a substantial portion of the loans 
every days a dutch auction is held by dealers and a rate of interest is set that matches buyers and sellers 
after successful auctions in january  some auctions in february and march failed when demand for bonds in the auction rate market was insufficient to clear the market 
in the case of failed auctions  the investor receives a penalty rate of interest  which is higher than the market rate 
due to the lack of liquidity  the investor holds the bonds until the next auction date when another attempt at a successful auction is made 
we believe that  given the federal government backing of the majority of our investments  the failed auctions are not due to the deteriorating credit quality of the investments  but rather the current overall us credit crisis and market illiquidity 
as a result  we believe the investments are not significantly impaired because of the ffelp backing and because cash from the investments is not urgently required 
our near term cash requirements will be satisfied by existing cash balances and through cash generated from the january sale of the orofacial business to luitpold 
the investments are classified as long term because we do not anticipate liquidating the investments over the next twelve months 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million  primarily consisting of salaries  clinical trials  research and development activities  general corporate operations and deposits on equipment for our new manufacturing facility

we will receive million in cash as a result of the transaction  plus approximately million in cash from the sale of existing inventory  and ongoing royalty payments based on net sales of gem s and other products that are based on adapting our technology to future products in the orofacial therepeutic field 
in addition  in december  we received a time based million milestone payment for the second anniversary of the us marketing approval for gem s and will also receive a million payment based upon the future anticipated eu regulatory approval of gem s 
we expect to devote substantial resources to continue our research and development efforts  including clinical trials 
clinical study costs are comprised of payments for work performed by contract research organizations  universities and hospitals 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and our investments in marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements at least through the first quarter of because of the significant time it will take for our product candidates to complete the clinical trial process  obtain approval from regulatory authorities and successfully commercialize our products  we may require substantial additional capital resources 
we may raise additional capital through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  corporate collaborations or other means 
we may attempt to raise additional capital due to favorable market conditions or other strategic considerations even if we have sufficient funds for planned operations 
to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuance of equity securities  our stockholders will experience dilution  and debt financings  if available  may involve restrictive covenants or may otherwise constra in our financial flexibility 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaborative arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our intellectual property or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
in addition  
table of contents payments made by potential collaborators or licensors generally will depend upon our achievement of negotiated development and regulatory milestones 
failure to achieve these milestones may harm our future capital position 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
capital may become difficult or impossible to obtain due to poor market or other conditions outside of our control 
if at any time sufficient capital is not available  either through existing capital resources or through raising additional funds  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  eliminate or divest one or more of our research  pre clinical or clinical programs 
seasonality in the first half of  we recognized our first product sales as luitpold acquired inventory after the november fda approval of gem s 
however  in  a more substantial portion of our product sales for gem s were recognized in the third and fourth quarters  with a lower portion of such product sales in the first and second quarters 
our manufacturing and supply agreement with luitpold obligated it to purchase all of its requirements for gem s from us and we were obligated to meet such requirements to the extent they were consistent with luitpold s forecasts 
in january  we completed a transaction to sell to luitpold our remaining orofacial therapeutic business  including the downstream formulation  fill  finish manufacturing and kitting rights to gem s

 reporting comprehensive income  are the same as the net losses reported

to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the market  it may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in certain businesses

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
we attempt to increase the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense 
due to the short term nature of our cash and cash equivalents  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our cash and cash equivalents 
our cash accounts earned interest rates ranging from to during the year ended december  we had investments in marketable securities in our portfolio at fixed rates  ranging from to  during the year ended december  we expect that future investments in marketable securities will generally be made at fixed rates 
we do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments in marketable securities
