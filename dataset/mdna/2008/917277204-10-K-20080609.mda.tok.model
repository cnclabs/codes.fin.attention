table of contents our products the urgent pc system is a minimally invasive nerve stimulation device designed for office based treatment of urge incontinence  urinary urgency and urinary frequency symptoms often associated with oab 
using a needle electrode inserted near the ankle  the urgent pc system delivers an electrical pulse that travels to the sacral nerve plexus  a control center for bladder function 
we believe that the urgent pc system is the only ptns device in the united states market for treatment of urinary symptoms often associated with oab 
we have received regulatory approvals for sale of the urgent pc system in the united states  canada and europe 
macroplastique is a minimally invasive  implantable soft tissue bulking product for the treatment of adult female stress urinary incontinence due to isd 
when macroplastique is injected into tissue around the urethra  it stabilizes and bulks tissues close to the urethra  thereby providing the surrounding muscles with increased capability to control the release of urine 
macroplastique has been sold for urological indications in over countries outside the united states since we began marketing this product in the united states in early our other products include i stop  a minimally invasive biocompatible  polypropylene  tension free sling  for the treatment of female urinary incontinence 
we distribute the i stop in the united kingdom under an exclusive distribution with cl medical 
ptq  a minimally invasive  soft textured  permanent implant for treatment of fecal incontinence and vox for otolaryngology vocal cord rehabilitation applications are sold outside of the united states 
in the netherlands and united kingdom only  we distribute certain wound care products in accordance with a distributor agreement 
sales  distribution and marketing we are focusing our sales and marketing efforts primarily on urologists  urogynecologists and gynecologists with significant office based and outpatient surgery based patient volume 
we believe the united states is a significant opportunity for future sales of our products 
in order to grow our united states business  we have expanded our sales organization  consisting of direct field sales personnel and independent sales representatives  marketing organization to market our products directly to our customers and reimbursement department 
we anticipate further increasing our sales and marketing organization in the united states  as needed  to support our sales growth 
by expanding our united states presence  we intend to develop long standing relationships with leading physicians treating incontinence and overactive bladder symptoms 
outside of the united states  we sell our products primarily through a direct sales organization in the united kingdom and primarily through distributors in other markets 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have made our best estimates and judgments of certain amounts  giving due consideration to materiality 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following are particularly important to the portrayal of our results of operations and financial position 
they may require the application of a higher level of judgment by uroplasty management  and as a result are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
revenue recognition 
the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
we believe our revenue recognition policies comply with sab we recognize revenue upon shipment of product to our distributors and direct customers 
we have no customer acceptance provisions or installation obligations 
our sales terms to our distributors and customers provide no right of return outside of our standard warranty  and payment terms consistent with industry standards apply 
sales terms and pricing to our distributors are governed by the respective distribution agreements 
our distributors purchase our products to meet the sales demand of their end user customers as well as to fulfill their internal requirements associated with the sales process and  if applicable  contractual purchase requirements under the respective distribution agreements 
internal and other requirements include purchases of products for training  demonstration and evaluation purposes  clinical 
table of contents evaluations  product support  establishing inventories  and meeting minimum purchase commitments 
as a result  the level of our net sales during any period is not necessarily indicative of our distributors sales to end user customers during that period  which we estimate are not substantially different than our sales to those distributors in each of the last two years 
our distributors level of inventories of our products  their sales to end user customers and their internal product requirements may impact our future revenue growth 
accounts receivable 
we carry our accounts receivable at the original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a periodic review of all outstanding amounts 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the customer s financial health  and both historical and expected credit loss experience 
we write off our accounts receivable when we deem them uncollectible 
we record recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off when received 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
we provide lower of cost or market reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories based upon current and expected future product sales and the expected impact of product transitions or modifications 
while we expect our sales to grow  a reduction in sales could reduce the demand for our products and may require additional inventory reserves 
foreign currency translation transactions 
the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries were translated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
foreign currency translation 
under this statement  we translate all assets and liabilities using period end exchange rates  and we translate statements of operations items using average exchange rates for the period 
we record the resulting translation adjustment within accumulated other comprehensive loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
we recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses in the statement of operations  including unrealized gains and losses on short term intercompany obligations using period end exchange rates  resulting in an increase in the volatility of our consolidated statements of operations 
we recognize unrealized gains and losses on long term intercompany obligations within accumulated other comprehensive loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets at march  consist of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we measure the recoverability of assets to be held and used by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if we consider such assets impaired  we measure the impairment to be recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
we report assets to be disposed of at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
share based compensation 
fasb published sfas no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
sfas r requires that we recognize the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions  including grants of employee stock options  in our financial statements 
we must measure that cost based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  performance based awards  share appreciation rights  and employee share purchase plans 
this statement requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for stock options based on the grant date fair value of the award  and to recognize the cost over the period we require our employee to provide services for the award 
defined benefit pension plans 
we have a liability attributed to defined benefit pension plans we offered to certain former and current employees prior to april we pay premiums to an insurance company to fund annuities and are responsible for funding additional annuities based on continued service and future salary increases for these employees pension benefit 
the liability is dependent upon numerous factors  assumptions and estimates  and the continued benefit costs we incur may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate  compensation rates  or retirement dates used to determine the projected benefit obligation 
additionally  changes made to the provisions of the plans may impact current and future benefit costs 
in accordance with accounting rules  changes in benefit obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as costs on the income statement  but are recognized in future 
table of contents years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates we expect to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences 
as of march   we have generated approximately million in us net operating loss carryforwards that we cannot use to offset taxable income in foreign jurisdictions 
we recognize a valuation allowance when we determine it is more likely than not that we will not realize a portion of the deferred tax asset 
we have established a valuation allowance for us and certain foreign deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty that we will generate enough income in those taxing jurisdictions to utilize the assets 
in addition  future utilization of nol carryforwards are subject to certain limitations under section of the internal revenue code 
this section generally relates to a percent change in ownership of a company over a three year period 
we believe that the issuance of our common stock in the december follow on public offering resulted in an ownership change under section accordingly  our ability to use nol tax attributes generated prior to december may be limited 
set forth below is management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended march  and results of operations net sales 
in fiscal  net sales were million  representing a million or increase compared to net sales of million in fiscal excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  net sales increased by approximately 
sales in the us contributed approximately percentage points to the reported sales growth 
sales to customers in the us in fiscal totaled million  representing a million or percent increase compared to million in fiscal we attribute this growth primarily to the sales of urgent pc system and the expanded sales organization 
sales to customers outside the us in fiscal were million  representing a million or increase compared to million in fiscal excluding the translation impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  sales increased by approximately  as decline in sales of macroplastique related products was nearly offset by the increase in sales of our other products 
gross profit 
gross profit was million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  or and of net sales in the respective periods 
we attribute the lower gross profit percentage for the fiscal year ended march  to the  of charges related to rework  scrap and warranty 
furthermore  we incurred  of restructuring charges net of pension curtailment benefit and  of inventory write off charges relating to the discontinuance of the i stop product sales in the us we attribute the higher gross profit percentage for fiscal year ended march  to the increase in manufacturing capacity utilization  and savings of approximately  offset by  of rent and lease exit charges due to the discontinuation of manufacturing at our eindhoven  the netherlands facility 
during the fiscal period  we also realized a favorable impact of approximately one percentage point in gross margin due to an increase in the average selling price in the us of the lead sets used with our urgent pc system and a favorable product mix 
we estimate that  during the fiscal period  the increased manufacturing capacity utilization  as a result of increased sales  added approximately three percentage points to our gross margin 
offsetting these favorable items was a charge of  for inventory write offs of which  was in the fourth fiscal quarter 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative g a expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal included in fiscal is a  non cash  sfas r charge for share based employee compensation  compared with a charge of  in fiscal excluding share based compensation charges  g a expenses increased by  primarily because of an 
table of contents increase in personnel related costs and consulting fees  offset by a reduction in rent expense for our leased facilities in the united kingdom and the us research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we attribute the decrease primarily to reduced consulting expenses of  and a decrease in personnel related costs of  in fiscal we incurred consulting expenses associated with the development of our second generation urgent pc system and preparation for a clinical study 
selling and marketing expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we attribute the increase primarily to a million increase in commissions for independent sales representatives and compensation related costs for our expanded us sales organization  a  increase in travel related costs  a  increase in costs to attend tradeshows  and an increase in other costs to support our expanded sales organization and marketing activities 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal in april  we acquired from cystomedix  inc  certain intellectual property assets related to the urgent pc system for million 
we are amortizing the intellectual property assets acquired over six years  starting in april other income expense 
other income expense includes interest income  interest expense  warrant expense  foreign currency exchange gains and losses and other non operating costs when incurred 
other income was  and  for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
interest income increased from  to  in fiscal because of higher average invested cash balance 
in fiscal we incurred a foreign currency exchange loss of  compared to a foreign currency exchange gain of  in fiscal we recognize exchange gains and losses primarily as a result of fluctuations in currency rates between the us dollar the functional reporting currency and the euro and british pound currencies of our subsidiaries  as well as their effect on the dollar denominated short term intercompany obligations between us and our foreign subsidiaries 
in may  we conducted a public rights offering 
in the rights offering  we issued to those shareholders who exercised their rights three shares of our common stock and a warrant  exercisable through july  to purchase an additional share of our common stock 
we registered with the sec the issuance of the shares  the warrants and the shares underlying the warrants 
in july  we suspended the right to exercise the warrants shortly before their scheduled expiration date because we announced a planned restatement of our fiscal financial statements 
in november  we became current with our sec filings 
in april  we chose to issue like kind replacement warrants to the holders of the expired warrants 
the terms for the replacement warrants required that we issue shares covered by a registration statement and maintain the effectiveness of the registration by making timely sec filings for the warrant holders to receive registered shares upon exercise of the warrants 
in april  we recognized a liability and equity charge of million associated with the grant of these warrants  and subsequently recognized in other income expense the change in fair value of the warrants due to the change in the value of our common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants 
we determined the fair value of the warrants using the black scholes option pricing model 
the period to exercise the warrants ended in march we recognized a net warrant expense of  in fiscal income tax expense in fiscal and fiscal  we recorded income tax expense  and  primarily related to our dutch subsidiary 
we cannot use our us net operating loss carry forwards to offset taxable income in foreign jurisdictions 
non gaap financial measures 
the following table reconciles our financial results calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap to non gaap financial measures that exclude non cash charges attributed to stock options under sfas r  and deprecation and amortization expenses from gross profit  operating expenses and operating loss 
the non gaap financial measures used by management and disclosed by us are not a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures and consolidated financial results calculated in accordance with gaap  and you should carefully evaluate our reconciliations to non gaap 
we may calculate our non gaap financial measures differently from similarly titled measures used by other companies 
therefore  our non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to those used 
table of contents by other companies 
we have described the reconciliations of each of our non gaap financial measures above to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures 
management uses our non gaap financial measures  and in particular non gaap operating loss  for internal managerial purposes because we believe such measures are one important indicator of the strength and the performance of our business because they provide a link to operating cash flow 
we also believe that analysts and investors use such measures to evaluate the overall operating performance of companies in our industry  including as a means of comparing period to period results and as a means of evaluating our results with those of other companies 
our non gaap operating loss of approximately million in fiscal declined from million in fiscal fiscal results include a  charge attributed to rent and cost to exit the lease for our manufacturing facility in eindhoven  the netherlands   charge for severance pay and a  charge for write off of inventory 
fiscal results include a  charge for restructuring  and a  charge for write off of inventory 
we attribute the fiscal decline in non gaap operating loss primarily to the increase in sales and an improvement in gross margin rate  offset partially by an increase in cash operating expenses 
years ended march  gross profit gaap gross profit of sales sfas r stock based compensation depreciation expenses non gaap gross profit operating expenses gaap operating expenses sfas r stock based compensation depreciation expenses amortization expenses non gaap operating expenses operating loss gaap operating loss sfas r stock based compensation depreciation expenses amortization expenses non gaap operating loss liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
as of march   our cash and cash equivalent and short term investments balances totaled million 
at march   we had working capital of approximately million 
in fiscal  we used million of cash for operating activities  compared to million of cash used in fiscal we attribute the decrease in cash used in operating activities primarily to the increase in sales and an improvement in gross profit rate  offset partially by increase in cash operating expenses 
sources of liquidity 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in august  we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors pursuant to which we sold approximately million shares of our common stock for per share  together with warrants to 
table of contents purchase  shares inclusive of warrants issued to the selling agent of our common stock  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
after offset for our estimated costs of  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
the warrants are exercisable for five years commencing days after closing at an exercise price of per share 
in december  we conducted a follow on public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock at a price per share of  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
in november  we conducted an additional follow on public offering in which we sold  shares of our common stock at price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the stock sale proceeds are offset by costs of approximately  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds from exercise of warrants and options were  in fiscal uroplasty bv  our subsidiary  has an agreement with rabobank of the netherlands for a  approximately  credit line 
the bank charges interest on the loan at the rate of one percentage point over the rabobank base interest rate base rate on march   subject to a minimum interest rate of per annum 
at march   we had no borrowings outstanding on this credit line 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs over the next twelve months 
however  we may need to raise additional financing to support our operations and planned growth activities in the future as we have yet to achieve profitability and generate positive cash flows 
to achieve profitability  we must generate substantially more revenue than we have this year or in prior years 
our ability to achieve significant revenue growth will depend  in large part  on our ability to achieve widespread market acceptance for our products and successfully expand our business in the us  which we cannot guarantee will happen 
if we are unable to raise the needed funds  we may need to curtail our operations including product development  clinical studies and sales and marketing activities 
this would adversely impact our future business and prospects 
ultimately  we will need to achieve profitability and generate positive cash flows from operations to fund our operations and grow our business 
commitments and contingencies 
we believe that our current resources  funds generated from sale of our products together with our credit lines will be adequate to meet our cash flow needs  including regulatory activities associated with our existing products  through the end of the next fiscal year fiscal 
we expect to continue to incur significant costs for clinical studies to support the marketing of our products and for regulatory activities associated with the fda required  post market studies in the united states for the macroplastique product 
we also expect that during fiscal  we will continue to incur significant expenses to support our us selling and marketing organization 
in april  we acquired from cystomedix certain intellectual property assets related to the urgent pc product and terminated the april exclusive manufacturing and distribution agreement 
in consideration  we issued cystomedix  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
under a royalty agreement we pay royalties  in the aggregate  of three to five percent of net sales of macroplastique  bioplastique  and ptq implants subject to a monthly minimum of  the royalties payable under this agreement will continue until the patent referenced in the agreement expires in under a license agreement for the macroplastique implantation system  we pay a royalty of british pounds for each unit sold during the life of the patent 
we have commitments  generally for periods less than twelve months  to purchase from various vendors finished goods and manufacturing components under issued purchase orders 
we have a defined benefit pension plan covering seven employees in the netherlands 
we pay premiums to an insurance company to fund annuities for these employees 
however  we are responsible for funding additional annuities based on continued service and future salary increases 
we closed this defined benefit plan for new employees in april as of that date  the dutch subsidiary established a defined contribution plan that now covers new employees 
we also closed our uk subsidiary s defined benefit plan to further accrual for 
table of contents all employees effective december   and  effective march  established a defined contribution plan that now covers new employees 
in january  we entered into a long term lease with liberty property limited partnership for an  square foot facility for our us headquarters located at feltl road  minnetonka  minnesota 
the lease effective date was may   has a term of months  requires average annual minimum rent payments of approximately  and requires payments for operating expenses we estimated at approximately  over months

under sfas no 
 we may elect to report financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on a contract by contract basis with changes in value reported in earnings

provides an opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring hedged assets and liabilities that were previously required to use a different accounting method than the related hedging contracts when the complex hedge accounting provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  are not met 
sfas no 
is effective for years beginning after november  if we adopt this standard  we do not expect it to have a material effect on our financial statements
