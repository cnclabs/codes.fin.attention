item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we recorded a million impairment charge related to trinity and a million impairment charge related to aston gardens in see also item  business significant developments 
our current and future investments in ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision making authority  our reliance on venture partners financial condition  any disputes that may arise between us and our venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our venture partners 
as of december  and june   we had a minority equity interest in ventures that we do not control which owned and senior living communities  respectively 
these ventures involve risks not present with respect to our consolidated communities or the communities that we manage only 
these risks include the following we share decision making authority with our venture partners regarding major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the venture and the community  such as the sale of the community or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the community and the approval of the annual operating and capital budgets  which may prevent us from taking actions that are opposed by our venture partners  prior consent of our venture partners may be required for a sale or transfer to a third party of our interests in the venture  which restricts our ability to dispose of our interest in the venture  our venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions  which may delay construction or development of a community or increase our financial commitment to the venture  our venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to the community that conflict with our business interests and goals  which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership  management or disposition of the community  disputes may develop with our venture partners over decisions affecting the community or the venture  which may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and distract our officers and or directors from focusing their time and effort on our business  and possibly disrupt the day to day operations of the community such as delaying the implementation of important decisions until the conflict or dispute is resolved  and we may suffer losses as a result of the actions of our venture partners with respect to our venture investments 
the refinancing or sale of communities held in ventures may not result in future distributions to us 
in the future  we expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale or refinancing of communities held in ventures 
when the majority equity partner in one of our ventures sells its equity interest to a third party  the venture frequently refinances its senior debt and distributes the net proceeds to the equity partners 
distributions received by us are first recorded as a reduction of our investment 
next  we record a liability for any contractual or implied future financial support to the venture including through our role as a general partner 
any remaining distributions are recorded as our share of earnings on our consolidated statement of income 
we refer to these transactions as recapitalizations 
additionally  most of our ventures are structured to provide a distribution to us upon the sale of the communities in the ventures 
none of the agreements governing our venture arrangements require refinancings of debt in connection with the sale of equity interests by our venture partners 
if the venture does not refinance senior debt or the property has not appreciated we would not receive any distributions in connection with the sale of equity interests by our venture partners 
in addition  there can be no assurance that future recapitalizations or asset sales will result in distributions to us 
in addition  if market conditions deteriorate or our communities experience poor performance  the amounts distributed to us upon recapitalizations or assets sales could be materially reduced or we may not receive distributions in some cases 
liability claims against us in excess of insurance limits could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
the senior living business entails an inherent risk of liability 
in recent years  we  as well as other participants in our industry  have become subject to an increasing number of lawsuits alleging negligence or similar claims 
many of these lawsuits involve large claims and significant legal costs 
we maintain liability insurance policies in amounts we believe are adequate based on the nature and risks of our business  historical experience and industry standards 
we purchase insurance for property  casualty and other risks from insurers based on published ratings by recognized rating agencies  advice from national insurance brokers and consultants and other industry recognized insurance information sources 
moreover  certain insurance policies cover events for which payment obligations and the timing of payments are only determined in the future 
any of these insurers could become insolvent and unable to fulfill their obligation to defend  pay or reimburse us for insured claims 
certain liability risks  including general and professional liability  workers compensation and automobile liability  and employment practices liability are insured in insurance policies with affiliated ie  wholly owned captive insurance companies and unaffiliated insurance companies 
we are responsible for the cost of claims up to a self insured limit determined by individual policies and subject to aggregate limits in certain prior policy periods 
liabilities within these self insured limits are estimated annually by management after considering all available information  including expected cash flows and actuarial analysis 
in the event these estimates are inadequate  we may have to fund the shortfall and our operating results could be negatively impacted 
claims may arise that are in excess of the limits of our insurance policies or that are not covered by our insurance policies 
if a successful claim is made against us and it is not covered by our insurance or exceeds the policy limits  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our obligations to pay the cost of claims within our self insured limits include the cost of claims that arise today but are reported in the future 
we estimate an amount to reserve for these future claims 
in the event these estimates are inadequate  we may have to fund the shortfall and our operating results could be negatively affected 
claims against us  regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  also could have a material adverse effect on our ability to attract residents or expand our business and could require our management to devote time to matters unrelated to the operation of our business 
we also have to renew our policies periodically and negotiate acceptable terms for coverage  exposing us to the volatility of the insurance markets  including the possibility of rate increases  and we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain insurance in the future at acceptable levels 
we have established a liability for outstanding losses and expenses at december   but the liability may ultimately be settled for a greater or lesser amount 
any subsequent changes are recorded in the period in which they are determined and will be shared with the communities participating in the insurance programs 
our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are required to perform under various financial guarantees or support arrangements that we have entered into as part of our operating strategy 
as part of our normal operations  we provide construction completion guarantees  debt guarantees  operating deficit guarantees credit facilities  credit support arrangements and liquidity support agreements to some of our ventures  lenders to the venture  or third party owners 
in addition  we may also undertake certain financing obligations in connection with acquisitions 
the terms of some of these obligations do not include a limitation on the maximum potential future payments 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a description of construction completion guarantees  debt guarantees  operating deficit guarantees credit facilities  credit support arrangements and liquidity support agreements provided to certain of our unconsolidated ventures or third party owners and certain financing obligations undertaken in connection with acquisitions 
if we are required to fund or perform under these arrangements  the amounts funded either become loans to the venture  or are recorded as a reduction in revenue or as an expense 
if we are required to fund any amounts related to these arrangements  our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
in addition  we may not be able to ultimately recover funded amounts 
our failure to generate sufficient cash flow to cover required interest  principal and operating lease payments could result in defaults of the related debt or operating leases 
at december   we had total indebtedness of million  including million outstanding on our bank credit facility 
at june   we had total indebtedness of million  including million outstanding on our bank credit facility 
we intend to continue financing our communities through mortgage financing and possibly operating leases or other types of financing  including lines of credit 
we cannot give any assurance that we or our ventures will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to cover required interest  principal and operating lease payments 
any payment or other default could cause the lender to foreclose upon the facilities securing the indebtedness or  in the case of an operating lease  could terminate the lease  with a consequent loss of income and asset value to us 
a payment or other default with respect to venture indebtedness also could trigger our obligations under support arrangements  as described in the risk factor above entitled our results of operations could be adversely affected if we are required to perform under various financial guarantees or support arrangements that we have entered into as part of our operating strategy 
in some cases  the indebtedness is secured by the community and a pledge of our interests in the community 
in the event of a default  the lender could avoid judicial procedures required to foreclose on real property by foreclosing on the pledge instead  thus accelerating the lender s acquisition of the community 
further  because our mortgages generally contain cross default and cross collateralization provisions  a payment or other default by us could affect a significant number of communities 
our failure to comply with financial obligations contained in debt instruments could result in the acceleration of the debt extended pursuant to such debt instruments  trigger other rights and restrict our operating and acquisition activity  and in the case of ventures  may cause acceleration of the venture s debt repayment obligations and any of our correlated guarantee obligations 
there are various financial covenants and other restrictions applicable to us in our debt instruments  including provisions that require us to satisfy financial statement delivery requirements  require us to meet certain financial tests 
for example  our bank credit facility requires us not to exceed certain leverage ratios  to maintain certain fixed charges coverage ratios  have a consolidated net worth of at least million as adjusted each quarter and to meet other financial ratios  maintain liquidity of not less than million composed of availability of under the bank credit facility plus up to not more than million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  and use any unrestricted cash and cash equivalents in excess of million to pay down the outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility  restrict our ability to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock  require consent for a change in control  and restrict our ability and our subsidiaries ability to borrow additional funds  dispose of all or substantially all assets  or engage in mergers or other business combinations in which we are not the surviving entity without lender consent 
these covenants could reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations by limiting our ability to borrow money and may create a risk of default on our debt if we cannot continue to satisfy these covenants 
during and and the first quarter of  as a result of the delay in completing our accounting review  we entered into several amendments to our bank credit facility which  among other things  extended the time period for furnishing quarterly and audited annual financial information to the lenders 
in connection with these amendments  the interest rate applicable to our outstanding balance under the bank credit facility and the borrowing rate in us dollars were also increased 
on march   we entered into an amendment to the bank credit facility that was designed to enable us to remain in compliance with the covenants under the bank credit facility by  among other things  modifying the delivery dates for our and audited financial statements and the unaudited financial statements for the first and second quarters of in connection with the march amendment  we also granted the lenders an additional security interest in  among other things  accounts  contract rights  notes and other intangibles and proceeds and products thereof as security for the payment of obligations under the bank credit facility 
in july  we executed another amendment to our bank credit facility  among other things  to retroactively waive financial covenant defaults that were largely due to additional charges related to losses on financial guarantees identified during the audit  which was completed in july  and also to waive compliance with the leverage ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants for the quarter ending september  in addition  the july amendment permanently reduced the maximum principal amount available under the bank credit facility to million  imposed new liquidity requirements described above and imposed additional restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and repurchase our common stock 
there can be no assurance that our operating results will produce sufficient earnings to meet the financial covenants for the quarter ending december  or subsequent periods 
at june   our outstanding borrowings were million and there were million in letters of credit under our million bank credit facility 
in the event we are unable to comply with the covenants and other obligations under the bank credit facility  we may need to seek additional amendments and waivers under our bank credit facility 
however  no assurance can be given that the lenders under the bank credit facility would agree to any further amendments or waivers 
the lenders could  among other things  agree to a further amendments or waivers  exercise their rights to accelerate the payment of all amounts then outstanding under the credit agreement and require us to replace or provide cash collateral for the outstanding letters of credit  or pursue further modifications with respect to the bank credit facility that impose additional obligations on us and further reduce our flexibility in conducting our operations 
if we default under our bank credit facility or other debt instruments  the debt extended pursuant to such debt instruments could become due and payable prior to its stated due date 
we cannot give any assurance that we could pay this debt if it became due 
further  our bank credit facility contains a cross default provision pursuant to which a default on other indebtedness by us or by any of our consolidated subsidiaries under the bank credit facility could result in the ability of the lenders to declare a default under and accelerate the indebtedness due under the bank credit facility 
there are also various financial covenants  financial statement delivery requirements  and other restrictions applicable to us in the debt instruments relating to certain of our ventures 
failure to meet these covenants may trigger acceleration of the ventures debt repayment obligations and any of our correlated guarantee obligations or give rise to any of the other remedies provided for in such debt instruments 
additionally  certain of our venture agreements provide that an event of default under the venture s debt instruments that is caused by us may also be considered an event of default by us under the venture agreement  giving our venture partner the right to pursue the remedies provided for in the venture agreement  potentially including a termination and winding up of the venture 
certain of our management agreements  both with ventures and with entities owned by third parties  provide that an event of default under the debt instruments applicable to the ventures or the entities owned by third parties that is caused by us may also be considered an event of default by us under the relevant management agreement  giving the non sunrise party to the management agreement the right to pursue the remedies provided for in the management agreement  potentially including termination of the management agreement 
interest rate increases could adversely affect our earnings because a portion of our total debt is floating rate debt 
at december   we had approximately million of floating rate debt at a weighted average interest rate of 
debt incurred in the future also may bear interest at floating rates 
therefore  increases in prevailing interest rates could increase our interest payment obligations  which would negatively impact earnings 
for example  a one percent change in interest rates would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately million based on the amount of floating rate debt at december  we may be adversely affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
historically  our primary exposure to currency exchange rates has been related to non us dollar denominated intercompany advances and loans to ventures 
as we increase our international presence through development and operations  we may transact additional business in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  we would be subject to the impact of foreign exchange translation on our financial statements 
to date  we have not hedged against foreign currency fluctuations  however  we may pursue hedging alternatives in the future 
although exposure to currency fluctuations to date has not had a material adverse effect on our business  there can be no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
at december   we had net us dollar equivalent assets liabilities of million  million and million in canadian dollars  british pounds and euros  respectively 
we recorded million  net  in exchange losses in million in gains related to the canadian dollar and million in losses related to the euro and british pound related to the weakened us dollar 
our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations and they may require management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have identified certain accounting estimates as being critical to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they require our management to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because the likelihood that materially different amounts would be recorded under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the risks related to our critical accounting estimates are described under critical accounting estimates in item of this form k 
because of the inherent uncertainty of the estimates associated with these critical accounting estimates  we cannot provide any assurance that we will not change our estimates  which could cause us to make significant subsequent adjustments to the related amounts recorded 
these adjustments could have a material adverse affect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
termination of resident agreements and vacancies in communities could adversely affect our revenues and earnings 
state regulations governing assisted living communities generally require written resident agreements with each resident 
most of these regulations also require that each resident have the right to terminate the resident agreement for any reason on reasonable notice 
consistent with these regulations  the resident agreements signed by us generally allow residents to terminate their agreement on days notice 
thus  we cannot contract with residents to stay for longer periods of time  unlike typical apartment leasing arrangements that involve lease agreements with specified leasing periods of up to a year or longer 
if a large number of residents elected to terminate their resident agreements at or around the same time  and if our units remained unoccupied  then our revenues and earnings could be adversely affected 
the discovery of environmental problems at any of the communities we own or operate could result in substantial costs to us  which would have an adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition 
under various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  as a current or previous owner or operator of real property  we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to the handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of medical waste generated at our facilities  identification and removal of the presence of asbestos containing materials in buildings  the presence of other substances in the indoor environment  including mold  and protection of the environment and natural resources in connection with development or construction of our communities 
some of our facilities generate infectious or other hazardous medical waste due to the illness or physical condition of the residents 
each of our facilities has an agreement with a waste management company for the proper disposal of all infectious medical waste  but the use of such waste management companies does not immunize us from alleged violations of such laws for operations for which we are responsible even if carried out by such waste management companies  nor does it immunize us from third party claims for the cost to clean up disposal sites at which such wastes have been disposed 
if we fail to comply with such laws and regulations in the future  we would face increased expenditures both in terms of fines and remediation of the underlying problem s  potential litigation relating to exposure to such materials  and potential decrease in value to our business and in the value of our underlying assets  which would have an adverse effect on our earnings  our financial condition and our ability to pursue our growth strategy 
in addition  we are unable to predict the future course of federal  state and local environmental regulation and legislation 
changes in the environmental regulatory framework could result in significant increased costs related to complying with such new regulations and result in a material adverse effect on our earnings 
in addition  because environmental laws vary from state to state  expansion of our operations to states where we do not currently operate may subject us to additional restrictions on the manner in which we operate our communities  further increasing our cost of operations 
our hospice revenues are highly dependent on payments from medicare and medicaid 
if there are changes in the rates or methods governing these payments for our services  our net patient service revenue and profits could materially decline 
our hospice revenues are highly dependent on payments from medicare and medicaid  paid primarily on a per diem basis  from the medicare and medicaid programs 
because we generally receive fixed payments for our hospice care services based on the level of care provided to our hospice patients  we are at risk for the cost of services provided to our hospice patients 
reductions or changes in medicare or medicaid funding could significantly affect the results of our hospice operations 
reductions in amounts paid by government programs for our services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could cause our net hospice revenue and profits to materially decline 
our hospice business is subject to a medicare cap amount which is calculated by medicare 
our hospice revenue and profitability could be adversely affected by limitations on medicare payments 
overall payments made by medicare to our hospice business are subject to a cap amount calculated by the medicare fiscal intermediary at the end of the hospice cap period 
the hospice cap period runs from november st of each year through october st of the following year 
total medicare payments received by each of the medicare certified programs during this period are compared to the cap amount for this period 
payments in excess of the cap amount must be returned by us to medicare 
the cap amount is calculated by multiplying the number of beneficiaries electing hospice care during the period by a statutory medicare cap amount that is indexed for inflation 
the medicare cap amount is reduced proportionately for medicare patients who transferred into or out of our hospice programs and either receive or will received hospice services from another hospice provider 
the hospice cap amount is computed on a program by program basis 
our hospice revenue for was reduced by approximately million as a result of our hospice programs exceeding the medicare cap 
our ability to comply with this limitation depends on a number of factors relating to a given hospice program  including number of admissions  average length of stay  mix in level of care and medicare patients that transfer into and out of our hospice programs 
our revenue and profitability may be materially reduced if we are unable to comply with this and other medicare payment limitations 
we cannot assure you that additional hospice programs will not exceed the cap amount in the future or that our estimate of the medicare cap contractual adjustment will not materially differ from the actual medicare cap amount 
if any of our hospice programs fail to comply with the medicare conditions of participation  that program could be terminated from the medicare program  thereby adversely affecting our net patient service revenue and profitability 
each of our hospice programs must comply with the extensive conditions of participation of the medicare hospice benefit 
if any of our hospice programs fail to meet any of the medicare conditions of participation  that program may receive a notice of deficiency from the applicable state surveyor 
if that hospice program then fails to institute a plan of correction and correct the deficiency within the correction period provided by the state surveyor  that program could be terminated from receiving medicare payments 
for example  under the medicare hospice program  each of our hospice programs must demonstrate that volunteers provide administrative and direct patient care services in an amount equal to at least of the total patient care hours provided by our employees and contract staff at the hospice program 
if we are unable to attract a sufficient number of volunteers at one of our hospice programs to meet this requirement  that program could be terminated from the medicare benefit if the program fails to address the deficiency within the applicable correction period 
any termination of one or more of our hospice programs from the medicare program for failure to satisfy the volunteer or other conditions of participation could adversely affect our net patient service revenue  profitability and financial condition 
risks related to the senior living industry competition in our industry is high and may increase  which could impede our growth and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
the senior living industry is highly competitive 
we compete with numerous other companies that provide similar senior living alternatives  such as home health care agencies  community based service programs  retirement communities  convalescent centers and other senior living providers 
in general  regulatory and other barriers to competitive entry in the independent and assisted living segments of the senior living industry are not as substantial as in the skilled nursing segment of the senior living industry 
in pursuing our growth strategies  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience competition in our efforts to develop and operate senior living communities 
we expect that there will be competition from existing competitors and new market entrants  some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we are able to obtain 
consequently  we may encounter competition that could limit our ability to attract new residents  increase resident fee rates  attract and retain capital partners for our ventures or expand our development activities or our business in general  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
similarly  overbuilding or oversupply in any of the markets in which we operate could cause us to experience decreased occupancy  reduced operating margins and lower profitability 
increased competition for residents could also require us to undertake unbudgeted capital improvements or to lower our rates  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our success depends on attracting and retaining skilled personnel  and increased competition for or a shortage of skilled personnel could increase our staffing and labor costs  which we may not be able to offset by increasing the rates we charge to our residents 
we compete with various health care services providers  including other senior living providers  in attracting and retaining qualified and skilled personnel 
we depend on our ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day to day operations of each community 
turnover rates and the magnitude of the shortage of nurses  therapists or other trained personnel vary substantially from community to community 
increased competition for or a shortage of nurses  therapists or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may require that we enhance our pay and benefits package to compete effectively for such personnel 
we may not be able to offset such added costs by increasing the rates we charge to our residents or our management fees 
if there is an increase in these costs or if we fail to attract and retain qualified and skilled personnel  our business  including our ability to implement our growth strategy  and operating results could be harmed 
the need to comply with government regulation of senior living communities may increase our costs of doing business and increase our operating costs 
senior living communities are generally subject to regulation and licensing by federal  state and local health and social service agencies and other regulatory authorities 
although requirements vary from state to state and community to community  in general  these requirements may include or address personnel education  training  and records  administration and supervision of medication  the provision of limited nursing services  admission and discharge criteria  documentation  reporting and disclosure requirements  staffing requirements  monitoring of resident wellness  physical plant specifications  furnishing of resident units  food and housekeeping services  emergency evacuation plans  and resident rights and responsibilities 
in several of the states in which we operate or intend to operate  laws may require a certificate of need before a senior living community can be opened 
in most states  senior living communities are also subject to state or local building codes  fire codes  and food service licensing or certification requirements 
independent living communities are unregulated and not subject to state or federal inspection 
however  communities that feature a combination of senior living options such as ccrcs  consisting of independent living campuses with a promise of future assisted living and or skilled nursing services and an entrance fee requirement  are regulated by state government  usually the state s department of insurance 
ccrcs are subject to state regulation of minimum standards to ensure financial solvency and are required to give annual disclosure regarding such things as the community s financial standing  the contractual obligations of services to the residents  residents rights and costs to residents to reside in the community 
communities licensed to provide skilled nursing services generally provide significantly higher levels of resident assistance 
communities that are licensed  or will be licensed  to provide skilled nursing services may participate in federal health care programs  including the medicare and medicaid programs 
in addition  some licensed assisted living communities may participate in state medicaid waiver programs 
such communities must meet certain federal and or state requirements regarding their operations  including requirements related to physical environment  resident rights  and the provision of health services 
communities that participate in federal health care programs are entitled to receive reimbursement from such programs for care furnished to program beneficiaries and recipients 
senior living communities that include assisted living facilities  nursing facilities  or home health care agencies are subject to periodic surveys or inspections by governmental authorities to assess and assure compliance with regulatory requirements 
such unannounced surveys may occur annually or bi annually  or can occur following a state s receipt of a complaint about the community 
as a result of any such inspection  authorities may allege that the senior living community has not complied with all applicable regulatory requirements 
typically  senior living communities then have the opportunity to correct alleged deficiencies by implementing a plan of correction 
in other cases  the authorities may enforce compliance through imposition of fines  imposition of a provisional or conditional license  suspension or revocation of a license  suspension or denial of admissions  loss of certification as a provider under federal health care programs  or imposition of other sanctions 
failure to comply with applicable requirements could lead to enforcement action that can materially and adversely affect business and revenues 
like other senior living communities  we have received notice of deficiencies from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
regulation of the senior living industry is evolving 
our operations could suffer if future regulatory developments  such as mandatory increases in scope of care given to residents  licensing and certification standards are revised  or a determination is made that the care provided by one or more of our communities exceeds the level of care for which the community is licensed 
if regulatory requirements increase  whether through enactment of new laws or regulations or changes in the application of existing rules  our operations could be adversely affected 
furthermore  there have been numerous initiatives on the federal and state levels in recent years for reform affecting payment of health care services 
some aspects of these initiatives could adversely affect us  such as reductions in medicare or medicaid program funding 
we are also subject to certain federal and state laws that regulate financial arrangements by health care providers  such as the federal anti kickback law 
this law makes it unlawful for any person to offer or pay or to solicit or receive any renumerationdirectly or indirectly  overtly or covertly  in cash or in kind for referring or recommending for purchase of any item or service which is eligible for payment under the medicare or medicaid programs 
authorities have interpreted this statute very broadly to apply to many practices and relationships between health care providers and sources of patient referral 
if a health care provider were to violate the anti kickback law  it may face criminal penalties and civil sanctions  including fines and possible exclusion from government programs such as medicare and medicaid 
similarly  health care providers are subject to the false claims act with respect to their participation in federal health care reimbursement programs 
under the false claims act  the government or private individuals acting on behalf of the government may bring an action alleging that a health care provider has defrauded the government and seek treble damages for false claims and the payment of additional monetary civil penalties 
many states have enacted similar anti kickback and false claims laws that may have a broad impact on health care providers and their payor sources 
recently other health care providers have faced enforcement action under the false claims act 
it is difficult to predict how our revenue could be affected if we were subject to an action alleging violations 
we are also subject to federal and state laws designed to protect the confidentiality of patient health information 
the us department of health and human services has issued rules pursuant to hipaa relating to the privacy of such information 
in addition  many states have confidentiality laws  which in some cases may exceed the federal standard 
we have adopted procedures for the proper use and disclosure of residents health information in compliance with the relevant state and federal laws  including hipaa 
risks relating to our organization and structure anti takeover provisions in our governing documents and under delaware law could make it more difficult to effect a change in control 
our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to obtain control of us or discourage an attempt to do so 
in addition  these provisions could limit the price some investors are willing to pay for our common stock 
these provisions include board authority to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock having a preference as to dividends or liquidation over the common stock without stockholder approval 
the issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock and could be used to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of sunrise  staggered board and board size fixed within range 
our board of directors is currently divided into three classes 
the total number of directors is fixed by a two thirds vote of the board within a range of minimum of two and a maximum of these provisions may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors 
at least two annual meetings of stockholders  instead of one  would generally be required to affect a change in a majority of our board of directors 
as indicated in the board of director s remedial framework  the board of directors has decided to discontinue staggered terms for board members pursuant to an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to be submitted for stockholder approval at the annual meeting 
if the amendment is approved by our stockholders  all board members will be elected annually by  filling of board vacancies  removal 
any vacancy occurring in the board of directors  including any vacancy created by an increase in the number of directors  shall be filled for the unexpired term by the vote of a majority of the directors then in office  and any director so chosen shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class in which the new directorship was created or the vacancy occurred 
due to our current classified board structure  directors may only be removed with cause by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our capital stock then entitled to vote at an election of directors 
if stockholders approve the declassification of our board at the annual meeting  directors may be removed with or without cause by such vote of stockholders  other constituency provision 
our board of directors is required under our certificate of incorporation to consider other constituencies  such as employees  residents  their families and the communities in which we and our subsidiaries operate  in evaluating any proposal to acquire the company 
this provision may allow our board of directors to reject an acquisition proposal even though the proposal was in the best interests of our stockholders subject to any overriding applicable law  call of special meetings 
a special meeting of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board  the president  by a majority of the directors or by stockholders possessing at least of the voting power of the issued and outstanding voting stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors 
this provision limits the ability of stockholders to call special meetings  stockholder action instead of meeting by unanimous written consent 
any action required or permitted to be taken by the stockholders must be affected at a duly called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be affected by any consent in writing by such holders  unless such consent is unanimous 
this provision limits the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting  supermajority vote of stockholders or the directors required for bylaw amendments 
a two thirds vote of the outstanding shares of common stock is required for stockholders to amend the bylaws 
amendments to the bylaws by directors require approval by at least a two thirds vote of the directors 
these provisions may make more difficult bylaw amendments that stockholders may believe are desirable  two thirds stockholder vote required to approve some amendments to the certificate of incorporation 
a two thirds vote of the outstanding shares of common stock is required for approval of amendments to the foregoing provisions that are contained in our certificate of incorporation 
all amendments to the certificate of incorporation must first be proposed by a two thirds vote of directors 
these supermajority vote requirements may make more difficult amendments to these provisions of the certificate of incorporation that stockholders may believe are desirable  and advance notice bylaw 
we have an advance notice bylaw provision requiring stockholders intending to present nominations for directors or other business for consideration at a meeting of stockholders to notify us no later than days before the meeting or days after the notice of the meeting date is mailed or public notice of the meeting is given  if less than days notice of the meeting date is given or made to stockholders 
this provision limits the ability of stockholders to make nominations for directors or introduce other proposals that are not timely received for consideration at a meeting 
in addition to the anti takeover provisions described above  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law 
section generally prohibits a person beneficially owning  directly or indirectly  or more of our outstanding common stock from engaging in a business combination with us for three years after the person acquired the stock 
however  this prohibition does not apply if a our board of directors approves in advance the person s ownership of or more of the shares or the business combination or b the business combination is approved by our stockholders by a vote of at least two thirds of the outstanding shares not owned by the acquiring person 
when we were formed  the klaassens and their respective affiliates and estates were exempted from this provision 
our board of directors has adopted a stockholder rights plan that could discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us

item legal proceedings trinity oig investigation and qui tam action as previously disclosed  on september   we acquired all of the outstanding stock of trinity 
as a result of this transaction  trinity became an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
on january   trinity received a subpoena from the phoenix field office of the oig requesting certain information regarding trinity s operations in three locations for the period january  through june   a period that was prior to the company s acquisition of trinity 
the company was advised that the subpoena was issued in connection with an investigation being conducted by the commercial litigation branch of the us department of justice and the civil division of the us attorney s office in arizona 
the subpoena indicates that the oig is investigating possible improper medicare billing under the fca 
in addition to recovery of any medicare reimbursements previously paid for false claims  an entity found to have submitted false claims under the fca may be subject to treble damages plus a fine of between  and  for each false claim submitted 
trinity has complied with the subpoena and continues to supplement its responses as requested 
on september   trinity and the company were served with a complaint filed on september  in the united states district court for the district of arizona 
that filing amended a complaint filed under seal on november  by four former employees of trinity under the qui tam provisions of the fca 
the qui tam provisions authorize persons relators claiming to have evidence that false claims may have been submitted to the united states to file suit on behalf of the united states against the party alleged to have submitted such false claims 
qui tam suits remain under seal for a period of at least days to enable the government to investigate the allegations and to decide whether to intervene and litigate the lawsuit  or  alternatively  to decline to intervene  in which case the qui tam plaintiff  or relator  may proceed to litigate the case on behalf of the united states 
qui tam relators are entitled to to of the recovery obtained for the united states by trial or settlement of the claims they file on its behalf 
on june   the department of justice and the us attorney for arizona filed a notice with the court advising of its decision not to intervene in the case  indicating that its investigation was still ongoing 
this action followed previous applications by the us government for extensions of time to decide whether to intervene 
as a result  on july   the court ordered the complaint unsealed and the litigation to proceed 
the matter is therefore currently being litigated by the four individual relators 
however  under the fca  the us government could still intervene in the future 
the amended complaint alleges that during periods prior to the acquisition by the company  trinity engaged in certain actions intended to obtain medicare reimbursement for services rendered to beneficiaries whose medical conditions were not of a type rendering them eligible for hospice reimbursement and violated the fca by submitting claims to medicare as if the services were covered services 
the relators alleged in their amended complaint that the total loss sustained by the united states is probably in the million to million range 
on july   the amended complaint was revised in the form of a second amended complaint which replaced the loss sustained range of to million with an alleged loss by the united states of at least million 
the original complaint named krg capital  llc an affiliate of former stockholders of trinity and trinity hospice llc a subsidiary of trinity as defendants 
the amended complaint names sunrise senior living  inc  krg capital  llc and trinity as defendants

overview our long range strategic objective is to grow our senior living business through a management services business model that is built on long term management contracts 
our four primary growth drivers consist of generating revenue growth from our existing operating portfolio of owned and managed communities  adding additional communities through new construction  primarily with venture partners  generating profitable growth through the delivery of hospice and other ancillary services  and maximizing our return on our equity investment in unconsolidated ventures and other invested capital 
we earn income primarily in the following ways management fees for operating communities  which can also include incentive management fees  resident fees for communities that we own  development and pre opening fees related to the development of new sunrise communities  our share of income and losses for those communities in which we have an ownership interest  recapitalizations and sales of communities by ventures in which we have an equity interest  and fees for hospice services 
at december   we operated communities  including communities in the united states  communities in canada  communities in the united kingdom and eight communities in germany  with a total resident capacity of approximately  we owned or had an ownership interest in of these communities and are managed for third parties 
in addition  at december   we provided pre opening management and professional services to communities under construction  of which communities are in the united states  three communities are in canada  eight communities are in the united kingdom  and one community is in germany  with a combined capacity for approximately  residents 
during  we opened new communities with a combined resident capacity of approximately  residents  which were developed by us 
management of communities we manage and operate communities that are wholly owned by us  communities that are owned by unconsolidated ventures in which we have a minority ownership interest and communities that are wholly owned by third parties 
for the communities that we manage for unconsolidated ventures and third parties  we typically are paid a base management fee of approximately five to eight percent of the community s revenue 
in addition  in certain management contracts  we have the opportunity to earn incentive management fees based on monthly or yearly operating or cash flow results 
see liquidity and capital resources for a description of debt guarantees  operating deficit guarantees and credit support arrangements provided to certain of our unconsolidated ventures or third party owners 
for the communities that we operate that are wholly owned  we receive resident and ancillary fees 
development of communities in order to grow the operating portfolio that we manage  we also develop senior living communities 
we typically develop senior living communities in partnership with others 
we also develop wholly owned senior living communities for ourselves  which we expect to sell to ventures or third party owners before construction is completed 
we believe we have maintained a disciplined approach to site selection and refinement of our operating model  first introduced more than years ago  and are constantly searching for ways to improve our communities 
we enter into development ventures in order to reduce our initial capital requirements  while enabling us to enter into long term management agreements that are intended to provide us with a continuing stream of revenue 
when development is undertaken in partnership with others  our venture partners provide significant cash equity investments  and we take a minority interest in such ventures 
additionally  non recourse third party construction debt is obtained to provide the majority of funds necessary to complete development 
in addition to third party debt  we may provide financing necessary to complete the construction for these development ventures 
at december  and june   there were and communities  respectively  under construction held in unconsolidated ventures 
see liquidity and capital resources for a description of guarantees provided to certain of our development ventures 
we receive fees from our development ventures for services related to site selection  zoning  design and construction oversight 
these fees are recognized in gain on the sale and development of real estate and equity interests in our consolidated statements of income for communities where we owned the land prior to sale to a venture or third party  and in professional fees from development  marketing and other when we do not initially own the land 
services provided for employee selection  licensing  training and marketing efforts are recognized as operating revenue and are included in professional fees from development  marketing and other in the consolidated statements of income 
see liquidity and capital resources for a description of development completion guarantees provided to certain of our development ventures 
we also receive fees from our ventures and or venture partners as compensation for either brokering the sale of venture assets or the sale of the majority partner s equity interest in a venture 
from time to time we also develop wholly owned senior living communities 
at december   we had seven wholly owned communities under construction with a resident capacity of approximately residents 
at june   we had six wholly owned communities under construction with a resident capacity of approximately residents 
we expect most of these communities to be sold to a venture or third party before construction is completed or  in some cases  upon receipt of a certificate of occupancy 
we provide funding for the construction  not otherwise financed by construction loans  and capitalize the development costs associated with construction prior to the contribution of the development community to a venture or third party owner 
for communities that remain wholly owned  we often recognize operating losses during the initial one to two years prior to the community achieving stabilization

special independent committee inquiry and accounting review the following is a summary of the results of the special independent committee inquiry 
for a full description of the adjustments made to restate the and prior financial statements  refer to our form k 
in december  our board of directors established a special independent committee to review certain allegations made by the service employees international union seiu that questioned the timing of certain stock option grants to our directors and officers over a period of time  and stock sales by certain directors in the months prior to the may announcement of our accounting review 
in march  our board of directors expanded the scope of the special independent committee s mandate to include the review of facts and circumstances relating to the historical accounting treatment of certain categories of transactions in the restatement  and to develop recommendations regarding any remedial measures  including those pertaining to internal controls and processes over financial reporting  that it may determine to be warranted 
the special independent committee deemed it necessary to understand the underlying causes for the pending restatement in order to evaluate the seiu s allegations related to stock sales by certain directors in the months prior to our announcement of the accounting review 
on september   we disclosed that the special independent committee had concluded the fact finding portion of its inquiry with respect to three issues 
the first involved the timing of certain stock option grants 
the second involved the facts and circumstances with respect to two significant categories of errors in the pending restatement relating to real estate accounting for the effect of preferences provided to the buyer in a partial sale  certain of our guarantees and commitments on the timing of sale accounting and recognition of income upon sale of real estate  and accounting for allocation of profits and losses in those ventures in which our partners received a preference on cash flow 
the third involved whether directors and executive officers traded in our common stock when in possession of non public knowledge of possible accounting errors related to these real estate transactions prior to our may announcement of our accounting review 
with respect to these three issues  the special independent committee found no evidence of backdating or other intentional misconduct with respect to the grants on the grant dates examined  including those specifically questioned by the seiu  or the possible errors identified by the special independent committee in the accounting for stock options  no evidence of an intention to reach an inappropriate accounting result with respect to the two categories of real estate accounting errors reviewed  no knowledge that these accounting errors were incorrect at the time they were made  and no evidence that information was concealed from review by the external auditors at the time the accounting judgments were made  and no evidence that any director or officer who traded in the months prior to the announcement of the accounting review had material non public information relating to either of these two categories of real estate accounting errors 
the special independent committee identified a number of accounting issues under gaap in connection with certain of the option grants reviewed 
as a result of the special independent committee s findings  we concluded that unintentional errors were made in connection with the accounting for a september repricing and certain other stock option grants 
these errors were corrected as part of the restatement of our historical consolidated financial statements 
in september   we also disclosed that the investigation of the special independent committee was continuing with respect to certain other categories of restatement items and issues  primarily related to certain accruals and reserves 
in the course of reviewing the accounting that led to the restatement  the special independent committee identified instances of potential inappropriate accounting with respect to certain provisions into and or releases from certain judgmental accruals and reserves 
management was also made aware through questions from an employee of possible instances of inappropriate accounting with respect to one judgmental reserve 
management reviewed this information with the special independent committee which then reviewed the judgmental reserve in question as part of its inquiry 
both of these events led to the special independent committee s decision to investigate the other categories of restatement items and issues  which was not complete on september  however  in order to provide information to the marketplace on the special independent committee s findings as promptly as possible  the special independent committee made the decision to complete the fact finding related to the seiu s allegations and make the september  disclosure to report the results of that fact finding while continuing its inquiry with respect to certain judgmental accruals and reserves 
on december   we announced the completion of the fact finding portion of the special independent committee inquiry with respect to the last issue being reviewed by it 
the special independent committee identified instances of inappropriate accounting with respect to certain provisions into and or releases from the following three judgmental accruals and reserves in certain quarters during the period of time from the third quarter of through the fourth quarter of the reserve for health and dental insurance claims associated with our self insurance program health and dental reserve  the corporate bonus accrual  and the reserve for abandoned projects 
the accounting for these reserves involves judgments and estimates 
the special committee determined that in some instances the judgments were not supportable under gaap and the provisions into and releases from the reserves were not made on a consistent basis  and therefore  involved inappropriate accounting 
the special independent committee did not reach any conclusions with respect to the underlying reason or reasons for any specific instance of inappropriate accounting 
the special independent committee also did not specifically quantify each instance of inappropriate accounting that it had identified 
as disclosed in item a of our form k  our management identified several material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that our management believed contributed to the accounting errors  including those related to accruals and reserves  that were corrected as part of the restatement 
these included  among others a lack of sufficient personnel with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge  experience and training to support the size and complexity of our organizational structure and financial reporting requirements  a failure to set the appropriate tone around accounting and control consciousness  a lack of appropriate oversight of accounting  financial reporting and internal control matters  insufficient analysis and documentation of the application of gaap to real estate and other transactions  a lack of written procedures for identifying and appropriately applying gaap to the various categories of items that were corrected in the restatement  a lack of written procedures for monitoring and adjusting balances related to certain accruals and reserves  a lack of effective accounting reviews for routine and non routine transactions and accounts  and an inability to close our books in a timely and accurate manner 
before the special independent committee completed its fact finding  we had determined to restate two of the accruals and reserves the health and dental reserve and the reserve for abandoned projects due to accounting errors unrelated to the inappropriate accounting subsequently identified by the special independent committee 
once the special independent committee had identified certain instances of inappropriate accounting  and had completed its investigation  it reviewed its findings with our new financial management team 
our new financial management team was then charged with reviewing  in detail  all of the affected accounts and with quantifying and recording all the necessary adjustments to properly restate the accounts 
during this process  our new financial management team did not specifically identify or categorize the adjustments between inappropriate accounting and other required adjustments within the identified categories 
as a result of our accounting review  we recorded total adjustments in which there was no distinct accounting impact from any instances of inappropriate accounting because any such impact was already subsumed within the previously required adjustments for example  required changes in methodology to the health and dental reserve  the corporate bonus accrual and the reserve for abandoned projects  which are reflected in the restated financial statements 
the total adjustment to the health and dental reserve and the corporate bonus accrual are reflected in the other adjustments restatement category in our form k 
the total adjustments for the reserve for abandoned project costs  which was eliminated in its entirety in the restatement  is included in the accounting for costs of real estate projects restatement category in our form k 
for information regarding remedial issues recommended by the special independent committee and adopted by the board of directors  please refer to item a in this form k
