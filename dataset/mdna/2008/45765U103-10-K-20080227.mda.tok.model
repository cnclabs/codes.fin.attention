management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued on january   we signed an agreement and plan of merger to acquire privately held calence  one of the nation s largest independent technology service providers specializing in cisco networking solutions  advanced communications and managed services 
this acquisition is consistent with our vision and strategy to become a g var through continued investment in certain key technology categories  including networking and advanced communications 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we will acquire calence for a purchase price of million 
up to an additional million in purchase price consideration may be due if certain performance targets are achieved over the next four years 
the purchase price is subject to customary working capital and hold back adjustments 
the acquisition has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is subject to customary closing conditions  including regulatory approval 
we expect the acquisition to close early in second quarter of on march   we completed the sale of pc wholesale  a division of our north america operating segment 
as a result of the disposition  pc wholesale s results of operations for all periods presented are classified as a discontinued operation 
see further information in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
also  consistent with our strategic plan for growth through targeted acquisitions  on september   we completed our acquisition of software spectrum  a global technology solutions provider with expertise in the selection  purchase and management of software 
the cash purchase price of million plus working capital of million  which included cash acquired of million  was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill 
software spectrum s results of operations have been included in our consolidated results of operations subsequent to the acquisition date 
on june   we completed the sale of of the outstanding stock of direct alliance  a business process outsourcing provider in the us  for a cash purchase price of million  subject to earn out and claw back provisions 
accordingly  direct alliance s results of operations for all periods presented are classified as a discontinued operation 
see further information in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist in the understanding of our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those consolidated financial statements from year to year and the primary factors that contributed to those changes  as well as how certain critical accounting estimates affect our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates general our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
for a summary of significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ from estimates we have made 
members of our senior management have discussed the critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  we recognize stock based compensation net of an estimated forfeiture rate and only recognize compensation expense for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award 

table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we elected to not make any modifications to existing stock options outstanding prior to january   such as accelerating the vesting of previously granted options  as we did not believe it made business sense to do so 
we did  however  take the opportunity to reevaluate our equity compensation plans  and starting in  we elected to primarily issue service based and performance based restricted stock units rsus 
the number of rsus ultimately awarded under performance based rsus varies based on whether we achieve certain financial results 
we will record compensation expense each period based on our estimate of the most probable number of rsus that will be issued under the grants of performance based rsus 
for any stock options awarded  modifications to previous awards or awards of rsus that are tied to specified market conditions  we use option pricing models or lattice binomial models to determine fair value of the awards  as permitted by sfas no 
r 
prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r  we applied the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

under this method  compensation expense was recorded on the measurement date only if the current market price of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price 
the measurement date is the date when the number of shares and exercise price are known with finality 
for grants determined to be variable under apb no 
 we remeasure  and report in our statement of earnings  the intrinsic value of the options at the end of each reporting period until the options are exercised  cancelled or expire unexercised 
in order to comply with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we determined the estimated fair value of stock options on the date of the grant using the black scholes merton black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model required us to apply highly subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  expected life of the option and the risk free interest rate 
a change in one or more of the assumptions used in the option pricing model may result in a material change to the estimated fair value of the stock based compensation 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further discussion of stock based compensation 
allowance for doubtful accounts our net accounts receivable balance was billion and million as of december  and  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the allowance is determined using estimated losses on accounts receivable based on historical write offs  evaluation of the aging of the receivables and the current economic environment 
should our clients or vendors circumstances change or actual collections of client and vendor receivables differ from our estimates  adjustments to the provision for losses on accounts receivable and the related allowances for doubtful accounts would be recorded 
see further information on our allowance for doubtful accounts in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
write downs of inventories we evaluate inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories unmarketable at normal margins 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account our contractual provisions with our partners governing price protection  stock rotation and return privileges relating to obsolescence 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protection and stock rotation  estimates are made regarding write downs of the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions by manufacturers publishers to discontinue certain products or product lines can affect our decision to write down inventories 
if our assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional write downs of inventories may be required 
in any case  actual values could be different from those estimated

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued valuation of long lived assets including purchased intangible assets and goodwill we review property  plant and equipment and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
our asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any and compares the fair value to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference 
this approach uses our estimates of future market growth  forecasted net sales and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized  and appropriate discount rates 
annually  during the fourth quarter of each year  we assess whether goodwill is impaired 
upon determining the existence of goodwill impairment  we measure that impairment based on the amount by which the book value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole 
determining the fair value of reporting units  as well as identifiable assets and liabilities  uses our estimates of market capitalization allocation  future market growth  forecasted sales and costs and appropriate discount rates 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if we encounter events or changes in circumstances that would indicate that  more likely than not  the book value of goodwill has been impaired 
based on impairment tests performed  there was no impairment of goodwill during the years ended december   or we identify potential impairment of goodwill through our strategic reviews of our reporting units and operations performed in conjunction with restructuring actions 
deterioration of our business in a geographic region or within a reporting unit in the future could lead to impairment adjustments as such issues are identified 
severance and restructuring activities we have engaged  and may continue to engage  in severance and restructuring activities which require us to utilize significant estimates related primarily to employee termination benefits  estimated costs to terminate leases or remaining lease commitments on unused facilities  net of estimated subleases 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  adjustments to severance and restructuring expenses in subsequent periods would be necessary 
a detailed description of our severance  restructuring and acquisition integration activities and remaining accruals for these activities at december  can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
taxes on earnings our effective tax rate includes the effect of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the us earnings remittance amounts are planned based on the projected cash flow needs as well as the working capital and long term investment requirements of our foreign subsidiaries and our domestic operations 
material changes in our estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements could affect our effective tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider past operating results  future market growth  forecasted earnings  historical and projected taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies and statutory tax law changes in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
however  until the adoption of sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas no 
r  the reversal of a valuation allowance established in purchase accounting upon the acquisition of software spectrum would result in a reduction of goodwill as opposed to a benefit to earnings 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r on january   any change in a valuation allowance established in purchase accounting will be a benefit to or charge against earnings 
additional information about the valuation allowance can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued contingencies from time to time  we are subject to potential claims and assessments from third parties 
we are also subject to various governmental  client and vendor audits 
we continually assess whether or not such claims have merit and warrant accrual under the probable and estimable criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
where appropriate  we accrue estimates of anticipated liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
such estimates are subject to change and may affect our results of operations and our cash flows 
additional information about contingencies can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods presented certain financial data as a percentage of net sales for the years ended december   and as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report  we have reported the results of operations of pc wholesale  which we sold on march   as a discontinued operation in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented

net sales for the year ended december  increased compared to the year ended december   in part  due to the acquisition of software spectrum in our net sales by operating segment for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in thousands change north america emea apac consolidated the increase in north america s net sales for the year ended december  was due primarily to the acquisition of software spectrum  which contributed to growth in our sales of software 
we also experienced slight organic growth in our hardware category and strong growth in our services category  which grew by year over year

table of contents insight enterprises  inc 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the increase of million or in emea s net sales for the year ended december  was due to organic growth and the acquisition of software spectrum as well as favorable currency exchange rates 
the effect of currency exchange rates between the weakening us dollar year over year as compared to the various european currencies in which we do business accounted for approximately million or of this increase 
software sales in the emea segment grew year over year and we also saw a very strong performance in our emea hardware and services categories  which grew and  respectively

our offerings in the remainder of our emea segment and in apac currently only include software and select software related services 
gross profit 
gross profit increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the increase in sales of software licenses for which we receive only an agency fee  as well as sales of software maintenance contracts and third party warranties for which only the gross profit is recorded as net sales  makes period to period comparability of net sales and costs of goods sold more difficult 
as a result  we believe that gross profit is a more reliable measure of business performance and is more useful in comparing period to period trends than net sales 
our gross profit and gross profit as a percent of net sales by operating segment for the years ended december  and were as follows dollars in thousands of net of net sales sales north america emea apac consolidated

these increases were partially offset by decreases in product margin  which includes vendor funding of basis points and in freight margin of basis points 
emea s gross profit increased for the year ended december  by compared to the year ended december  gross profit per account executive increased from  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  as a percentage of net sales  gross profit decreased by approximately basis points from to due primarily to decreases in product margin of nearly basis points resulting primarily from our acquisition of software spectrum  whose overall gross margins are generally lower than those in our legacy business due to the sales mix of software only compared to hardware  software and services for our legacy business 
we also saw a basis point decline related to decreases in supplier discounts due to a change in supplier mix  resulting primarily from our acquisition of software spectrum 
these decreases in gross margin were offset partially by higher agency fees for microsoft enterprise software agreement renewals which contributed nearly basis points improvement 
apac s gross profit increased for the year ended december  by compared to the year ended december  due to the inclusion of a full year of apac results in operating expenses

apac s selling and administrative expenses increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the inclusion of software spectrum results for a full year in severance and restructuring expenses 
during the year ended december   north america  emea and apac recorded severance expense of million   and  respectively

interest income 
interest income for the years ended december  and was generated through short term investments 
the decrease in interest income is due to a generally lower level of cash available to be invested in short term investments as we paid down debt balances and completed stock repurchases during interest expense 
interest expense for the years ended december  and primarily relates to borrowings under our financing facilities 
the increase in interest expense is primarily due to a higher weighted average borrowings outstanding for the year ended december  compared with given the debt incurred for the acquisition of software spectrum was only outstanding for a third of the year in net foreign currency exchange gains 
these gains result from foreign currency transactions  including intercompany balances that are not considered long term in nature 
the increase in the net foreign currency exchange gain is due primarily to increases in the volume of business transacted outside of the us and the continued decline in the value of the us dollar against currencies we transact business in  specifically the canadian dollar  the euro and the british pound sterling 
other expense  net 
other expense  net  consists primarily of bank fees associated with our financing facilities and cash management 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the effective tax rate is higher in due primarily to an increase in our tax reserves relating to uncertain tax positions 
further  our effective tax rate reflects the reversal of accrued income taxes resulting from the determination that a reserve previously recorded for potential tax exposures was no longer necessary

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth for the periods presented certain consolidated cash flow information for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net cash provided by used in discontinued operations foreign currency exchange effect on cash flow increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year cash and cash flow our primary uses of cash in the past few years have been to fund acquisitions  working capital requirements and capital expenditures and to repurchase our common stock 
we generated very strong operating cash flows for the year ended december  operating activities provided million in cash  a increase over the year ended december  our strong operating cash flows  along with million from the sale of pc wholesale enabled us to not only reduce our outstanding debt by million  but also fund million of repurchases of our common stock during the year 
capital expenditures were million for the year  a increase over  primarily related to expenditures for our mysap upgrade 
additionally  benefited from a million positive effect of foreign currency exchange rates on cash flow for  compared to million in we sold pc wholesale in march and have presented it as a discontinued operation 
excluding net earnings  amounts related to the discontinued operation have not been removed from the  and cash flow statements because the effect is immaterial 
net cash provided by operating activities 
cash flows from operations for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization  and an increase in accounts payable partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts payable can be primarily attributed to an increase in net sales  and the related costs of goods sold  offset partially by a decrease in days purchases outstanding  as discussed below 
the higher accounts receivable balance at december  can be primarily attributed to an increase in sales as well as to a slow down in collections in our north american and emea operations due to internal collection productivity issues and slower customer payments 
cash flows from operations for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization  and increases in accounts payable and decreases in inventories 
these increases in operating cash flows were partially offset by increases in accounts receivable 
the increased accounts payable and accounts receivable balances can be primarily attributed to the software spectrum acquisition 
cash flows from operations for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net earnings from continuing operations before depreciation and amortization partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories 
the increase in accounts receivable was due to increases in net sales with terms longer than net at the end of primarily related to our large enterprise and public sector clients 
the increase in inventories was due primarily to increases in opportunistic purchases and a decision to carry additional inventories for our integration labs and upcoming projects with large enterprise and public sector clients at the end of

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued our consolidated cash flow operating metrics for the years ended december   and are as follows days sales outstanding in ending accounts receivable dsos a inventory turns excluding inventories not available for sale b days purchases outstanding in ending accounts payable dpos c a calculated as the balance of accounts receivable  net at the end of the year divided by daily net sales 
daily net sales is calculated as net sales divided by days 
b calculated as costs of goods sold divided by average inventories 
average inventories is calculated as the sum of the balances of beginning inventories plus ending inventories divided by two 
c calculated as the balances of accounts payable plus inventories financing facility at the end of the year divided by daily costs of goods sold 
daily costs of goods sold is calculated as costs of goods sold divided by days 
the decrease in dsos from the year ended december  is due primarily to the fact that dsos included receivables acquired in the software spectrum acquisition and only four months of related net sales  thus skewing dsos to appear higher than normal 
still  dsos are higher than we would expect in the future due to a higher proportion of sales to clients with longer payment terms  a slow down in collections in our north america and emea operations and an increase in sales toward the end of the year 
improving our cash conversion cycle will be an area of focus in as we continue to focus on our return on invested capital 
the decrease in dpos from the year ended december  is due primarily to the similar effect on dpos of the software spectrum acquisition which skew the dpos to appear higher  offset by efforts in to improve this metric and better manage the timing of payments 
the increase in inventory turns is primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of software spectrum s operations in which require very little inventory 
assuming sales continue to increase in the future  we expect that cash flow from operations will be used  at least partially  to fund working capital as we typically pay our partners on average terms that are shorter than the average terms granted to our clients in order to take advantage of supplier discounts 
net cash used in investing activities 
capital expenditures of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily related to investments to upgrade our it systems to mysap  including capitalized costs of software developed for internal use  it equipment and software licenses 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  of million primarily related to capitalized costs of software developed for internal use  the purchase of a previously leased office facility  leasehold improvements primarily in our illinois distribution center and in our london facility and computer equipment 
we expect total capital expenditures in to be between million and million 
during the year ended december   we received million for the sale of pc wholesale 
during the year ended december   we received million for the sale of direct alliance and used million  net of cash acquired of million  to acquire software spectrum 
in january  we received million owed to us by an underwriter related to the sale of our investment in plusnet  a discontinued operation 
net cash used in provided by financing activities 
during the year ended december   we reduced our outstanding debt by million and funded repurchases of million of our common stock 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million of proceeds from sales of common stock under employee stock plans 
during the year ended december   the acquisition of software spectrum was partially financed by new term loan borrowings of million under our amended and restated credit facility and million under our amended accounts receivables securitization financing facility 
during the year ended december   cash was provided by borrowings on our short term financing facility and our line of credit and by cash received from common stock issuances as a result of stock option exercises 
cash was primarily used to make repayments on our short term financing facility and to repurchase shares of our common stock 
on december   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
during the year ended december   we repurchased million shares on the open market at an average price of per share  which represented the full amount authorized under the repurchase program 
all shares repurchased have been retired 
on november   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of our common stock 
there were no repurchases under this new program as of december

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we anticipate that cash flows from operations  together with the funds available under our financing facilities and existing commitments to provide new facilities  will be adequate to support our presently anticipated cash and working capital requirements for operations over the next twelve months as well as the planned acquisition of calence 
additionally  we expect to use any excess cash primarily to reduce outstanding debt and to fund additional acquisitions and or repurchases of our common stock 
cash and cash equivalents held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation upon repatriation to the us for foreign entities not treated as branches for us tax purposes  we do not provide for us income taxes on the undistributed earnings of these subsidiaries as earnings are reinvested and  in the opinion of management  will continue to be reinvested indefinitely outside of the us as of december   cash and cash equivalents of million were held by our foreign subsidiaries 
the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are deemed to be permanently invested outside of the us were million at december  as part of our long term growth strategy  we intend to consider additional acquisition opportunities from time to time  which may require additional debt or equity financing 
as of december   we failed to comply with a covenant  as defined in our accounts receivable securitization financing facility agreement  that requires us to have no more than a certain percentage of aged receivables as compared to total receivables 
in january  we amended our securitization facility  effective december   to change the definition of the covenant  including an amendment to the definition of how the covenant is calculated and its maximum limit 
at december   we were in compliance with the amended terms 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for a description of our financing facilities  including terms and covenants  amounts outstanding  amounts available and weighted average borrowings and interest rates during the year 
off balance sheet arrangements we have entered into off balance sheet arrangements  which include guaranties and indemnifications  as defined by the sec s final rule  disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 
the guaranties and indemnifications are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
we believe that none of our off balance sheet arrangements have  or is reasonably likely to have  a material current or future effect on our financial condition  sales or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
contractual obligations for continuing operations at december   our contractual obligations for continuing operations were as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt a operating lease obligations severance and restructuring obligations b other contractual obligations c total a includes our accounts receivable securitization facility that expires september and our term loan facility that is scheduled to be paid off in september b as a result of approved severance and restructuring plans  we expect future cash expenditures related to employee termination benefits and facilities based costs

iv 
during the year ended december   we adopted fin no 
which states that companies must recognize a liability for the fair value of a legal obligation to perform asset retirement activities that are conditional on a future event if the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we estimate that we will owe million in future years in connection with these obligations 
the table above excludes million of liabilities under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount of timing of settlement 
see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
although we set purchase targets with our partners tied to the amount of supplier reimbursements we receive  we have no material contractual purchase obligations 
acquisitions our strategy includes the possible acquisition of or investments in other businesses to expand or complement our operations 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future acquisitions or investments will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of suitable candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions 
financing for future transactions would result in the utilization of cash  incurrence of additional debt  issuance of stock or some combination of the three 
as noted above  on january   we announced the signing of an agreement and plan of merger to acquire privately held calence for a purchase price of million 
up to an additional million in purchase price consideration may be due if certain performance targets are achieved over the next four years 
to facilitate the acquisition of calence  we have received a commitment from a financial institution to provide up to million in new revolving credit to finance the acquisition and for general corporate purposes 
it is contemplated that the new revolving facility will be funded through a syndicate of banks and will replace our current million revolving credit facility and our million term loan 
inflation we have historically not been adversely affected by inflation  as technological advances and competition within the it industry have generally caused the prices of the products we sell to decline and product life cycles tend to be short 
this requires our growth in unit sales to exceed the decline in prices in order to increase our net sales 
we believe that most price increases could be passed on to our clients  as prices charged by us are not set by long term contracts  however  as a result of competitive pressure  there can be no assurance that the full effect of any such price increases could be passed on to our clients 
recently issued accounting standards see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for a description of recent accounting pronouncements  including our expected dates of adoption and the estimated effects on our results of operations and financial condition

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued forward looking statements for the full year  we expect organic net sales to grow faster than the market growth rate  which we expect to be approximately on a world wide basis  and fully diluted earnings per share are expected to range between and  of which is expected to be recorded in the first half of the year 
these expectations reflect the following assumptions an effective tax rate of for the full year  completion of the million stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in november  and cash outlays for capital expenditures of approximately million to million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest risk we have interest rate exposure arising from our financing facilities  which have variable interest rates 
these variable interest rates are affected by changes in short term interest rates 
we try to limit interest rate exposure by maintaining a low debt to equity ratio 
although the credit agreement we entered into to finance in part the acquisition of software spectrum increased our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates  we believe that the effect of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows will not be material 
our financing facilities expose net earnings to changes in short term interest rates since interest rates on the underlying obligations are variable 
we had million outstanding under our term loan  no amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit and million outstanding under our accounts receivable securitization financing facility at december  the interest rates attributable to the term loan  the line of credit and the financing facility were  and  respectively  per annum at december  a change in annual net earnings from continuing operations resulting from a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would approximate million 
foreign currency exchange risk we use the us dollar as our reporting currency 
the functional currencies of our significant foreign subsidiaries are generally the local currencies 
accordingly  assets and liabilities of the subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet dates 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rate for each month within the year 
translation adjustments are recorded directly in other comprehensive income as a separate component of stockholders equity 
net foreign currency transaction gains losses  including transaction gains losses on intercompany balances that are not of a long term investment nature  are reported as a separate component of non operating income expense in our consolidated statements of earnings 
we also maintain cash accounts denominated in currencies other than the local currency which expose us to foreign exchange rate movements 
we monitor our foreign currency exposure and may from time to time enter into individual hedging transactions 
we do not currently have a hedging program in place to minimize exposure across our portfolio of currency exposures 
there were no hedging transactions during the quarter ended december   and there were no hedging instruments outstanding at december
