critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we consider the following critical accounting policies to be those that require us to make the most significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our consolidated financial statements 
net revenue we derive a significant portion of our revenue from medicare  various state medicaid programs and managed care health plans 
payments for services rendered to patients covered by these programs are generally less than billed charges 
for medicare and medicaid revenue  provisions for contractual adjustments are made to reduce the charges to these patients to estimated cash receipts based upon the programs principles of payment reimbursement ie  either prospectively determined or retrospectively determined costs 
final settlements under these programs are subject to administrative review and audit and  accordingly  we periodically provide reserves for the adjustments that may ultimately result therefrom 
estimates for contractual allowances under managed care health plans are primarily based on the payment terms of contractual arrangements  such as predetermined rates per diagnosis  per diem rates or discounted fee for service rates 
we closely monitor our historical collection rates  as well as changes in applicable laws  rules and regulations and contract terms  to ensure that provisions are made using the most accurate information available 
however  due to the complexities involved in these estimations  actual payments from payors may be different from the amounts we estimate and record 
in the ordinary course of business  we provide services to patients who are financially unable to pay for their care 
accounts characterized as charity and indigent care are not recognized in net revenue 
prior to january   our policy and practice was to forego collection of a patient s entire account balance upon determining that the patient qualified under a hospital s local charity care and or indigent policy 
commencing january   we implemented a uniform policy wherein patient account balances are characterized as charity and indigent care only if the patient meets certain percentages of the federal poverty level guidelines 
local hospital personnel and our collection agencies pursue payments on accounts receivable from patients that do not meet such criteria 
we monitor the levels of charity and indigent care provided by our hospitals and the procedures employed to identify and account for those patients 

table of contents as a result of our settlement of a class action lawsuit that involved billings to uninsured patients  we began discounting gross charges to uninsured patients for non elective procedures by in february no such discounts were previously provided 
in connection with this change  we recorded approximately million of uninsured self pay patient revenue discounts during the calendar year 
in addition to such uninsured patient discounts  foregone charges for charity and indigent care patient services based on established rates aggregated approximately million  million  million and million during the calendar year  the calendar year  the three month period and the fiscal year  respectively 
provision for doubtful accounts our hospitals provide services to patients with health care coverage  as well as to those without health care coverage 
those patients with health care coverage are often responsible for a portion of their bill referred to as the co payment or deductible 
this portion is determined by the patient s specific health care or insurance plan 
patients without health care coverage are evaluated at the time of service  or shortly thereafter  for their ability to pay based on federal and state poverty guidelines  qualification for medicaid or other state assistance programs  as well as our policies for indigent and charity care 
after payment  if any  is received from a third party  statements are sent to individual patients indicating the outstanding balances on their accounts 
if an account is still outstanding after a period of time  it is referred to a primary collection agency for assistance in collecting the amount due 
the primary collection agency begins the process of debt collection by contacting the patient via mail and phone 
the accounts that are sent to these agencies are often difficult to collect and require more focused  dedicated attention than might be available in the local hospital business office 
we believe that the primary collection agencies have proven very successful in collecting the accounts that we send to them 
a secondary collection agency is utilized when accounts are returned from the primary collection agency as uncollectible 
these accounts are written off as uncollectible shortly after they are returned from the primary collection agency 
in certain circumstances  we may sell a portfolio of outstanding accounts receivable to an independent third party 
we completed one such transaction during the calendar year see note g to the consolidated financial statements in item  however  there can be no assurances that we will enter into similar transactions in future periods 
an account is typically sent to the primary collection agency automatically via electronic transfer of data at the end of the statement cycle although  if deemed necessary or appropriate  the account can be sent to the primary collection agency at any time 
accounts that are identified as self pay accounts with balances less than are automatically written off on the th day of each month 
all accounts that have been placed with a primary collection agency that are less than are also written off 
we closely monitor our cash collection trends and the aging of our accounts receivable 
based on our observations  we periodically adjust our accounting policies and estimates 
as discussed at note g to the consolidated financial statements in item  we modified our allowance for doubtful accounts reserve policy for self pay patients during the fiscal year and the calendar year 
our allowance for doubtful accounts reserve policy for self pay patients was further modified during the calendar year 
after implementing a new revenue discounting policy in february  discounted self pay accounts receivable were initially reserved at 
however  as a result of i a subsequent cash collection analysis that evaluated the adequacy of the february self pay reserve policy modification and ii continued deterioration in our self pay accounts receivable balances  we concluded that it was necessary to reserve a greater portion of self pay accounts receivable 
accordingly  effective june   we revised our policy for self pay patients to increase our reserves for those accounts that are aged less than days from the date that the services were rendered 
we believe that the june change in self pay patient allowances for doubtful accounts appropriately addresses our risk of collection pertaining to the related accounts receivable balances 
over the past several years  we have not experienced similar adverse trends with respect to our other payors such as medicare  medicaid and managed care health plans 
our recent accounting policy modifications for self pay patients were based on  among other things  our current self pay patient cash collection rates and significant increases in uninsured and underinsured patient service volume that have been experienced by us and the hospital industry as a whole 
although we believe that our current policy is appropriate and responsive to the current health care environment and the overall economic climate  we will continue to monitor these circumstances and related industry trends 
changes in payor mix  general economic conditions or trends in federal and state governmental health care coverage could adversely affect our accounts receivable collections  cash flows and results of operations and could result in additional accounting policy modifications in the future 

table of contents of accounts receivable identified as due from third party payors at the time of billing  a small percentage may convert to self pay upon denials from third party payors 
those accounts are closely monitored on a routine basis for potential denial and are reclassified as appropriate 
the approximate percentages of total gross billed accounts receivable  summarized by aging category and including our discontinued operations  are as follows december  days days days days and over medicare medicaid commercial insurance and others self pay totals december  days days days days and over medicare medicaid commercial insurance and others self pay totals the increase in self pay accounts greater than days from december  to december  is a reflection of the fact that accounts are maintained on the aging throughout the collection process as of december  in an effort to better monitor overall collection trends 
accounts receivable are reserved at increasing percentages as they age 
all accounts are reserved when they age days from the date of discharge 
in addition to days sales outstanding  which is discussed below under liquidity  capital resources and capital expenditures  we utilize other factors to analyze the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
in that regard  we compare subsequent cash collections to net accounts receivable recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
we also review the provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of net revenue and the allowance for doubtful accounts as a percent of gross accounts receivable 
these and other factors are reviewed monthly and are closely monitored for developing trends in our accounts receivable portfolio 
impairments of long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review our long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be fully recoverable 
the determination of possible impairment of assets to be held and used is predicated on our estimate of the asset s undiscounted future cash flows 
if the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the asset s estimated fair value and its carrying value 
long lived assets to be disposed of  including discontinued operations  are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
there were no long lived asset impairment charges that were material to our consolidated financial position or income from continuing operations during the calendar year  the three month period or the fiscal year  however  during the calendar year  we recognized a long lived asset impairment charge of million  which was predicated on a then pending sale of a hospital that we ultimately retained 
goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is no longer amortized 
however  goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or whenever circumstances indicate that a possible impairment might exist 
our judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on  among other things  market conditions and operational performance 
when performing the impairment test  we initially compare the fair values of our reporting units net assets  including allocated corporate net assets  to the corresponding carrying amounts on the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a market approach methodology based on net revenue multiples 
if the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets is less than the balance sheet carrying amount  we determine the implied fair value of goodwill  compare such fair value to the reporting unit s goodwill carrying amount and  if necessary  record a goodwill 
table of contents impairment charge 
there were no goodwill impairment charges to continuing operations during the calendar year  the calendar year  the three month period or the fiscal year 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but are ultimately unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
additionally  we make certain judgments and assumptions when allocating corporate assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
changes in the estimates used to conduct goodwill impairment tests  including revenue and profitability projections and market values  could indicate that our goodwill is impaired in future periods and result in a write off of some or all of our goodwill at that time 
reporting units are one level below the operating segment level see note n to the consolidated financial statements in item 
however  after consideration of sfas no 
s aggregation rules  we determined that our goodwill impairment testing should be performed at a divisional operating level 
goodwill is discretely allocated to our reporting units ie  each hospital s goodwill is included as a component of the aggregate reporting unit goodwill being evaluated during the impairment analysis 
as discussed at note to the consolidated financial statements in item  we recognized a long lived asset and goodwill impairment charge of million in discontinued operations during the calendar year 
income taxes we make estimates to record the provision for income taxes  including conclusions regarding deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities  as well as valuation allowances that might be required to offset deferred tax assets 
we estimate valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized in future periods 
when establishing valuation allowances  we consider all relevant information  including ongoing tax planning strategies 
we believe that  other than certain state net operating loss carryforwards  future taxable income will enable us to realize our deferred tax assets and  therefore  we have not recorded any significant valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets 
we operate in multiple states with differing tax laws 
we are subject to both federal and state audits of our tax filings 
our federal income tax returns have been examined by the internal revenue service through the year ended september  and resulted in no material audit adjustments 
our federal income tax returns for the tax periods ended september   september  and december  are currently being audited by the internal revenue service 
we make estimates to record tax reserves that adequately provide for audit adjustments  if any 
during june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin 
among other things  fin prescribes a minimum recognition threshold that an income tax position must meet before it is recorded in the reporting entity s financial statements 
fin requires that the effects of such income tax positions be recognized only if  as of the balance sheet reporting date  it is more likely than not ie  more than a likelihood that the income tax position will be sustained based solely on its technical merits 
when making this assessment  management must assume that the responsible taxing authority will examine the income tax position and have full knowledge of all relevant facts and other pertinent information 
the new accounting guidance also clarifies the method of accruing for interest and penalties when there is a difference between the amount claimed  or expected to be claimed  on a company s income tax returns and the benefits recognized in the financial statements 
additionally  fin requires significant new and expanded footnote disclosures in all annual periods 
we adopted fin with an effective date of january  retrospective application of fin was prohibited 
in accordance with the transitional provisions of fin  we recorded a cumulative effect adjustment to reduce retained earnings by approximately million on january  professional liability claims commencing october   we began using our wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  which is domiciled in the cayman islands  to self insure a greater portion of our primary professional liability risk 
since its inception  the captive insurance subsidiary has provided claims made coverage to all of our hospitals and a limited number of our employed physicians 
during the years ended september  and  we also procured claims made policies from independent commercial carriers to provide coverage for losses and loss expenses beyond the captive insurance company s policy limits 
subsequent to september   the captive insurance company provided enhanced coverage to us and  in connection therewith  it obtained claims made reinsurance policies for professional liability risks above certain self retention levels 

table of contents prior to march   substantially all of our employed physicians were covered under claims made policies with third party insurers  however  commencing march   we began providing occurrence basis insurance policies to most of our employed physicians through a wholly owned risk retention group subsidiary that is domiciled in south carolina 
the risk retention group subsidiary maintains a claims made reinsurance policy for professional liability risks above certain self retention levels 
prior to march   when a physician terminated employment with us  tail insurance was generally procured for such physician to cover the portion of employed service that was previously covered under a claims made policy 
our reserves for self insured professional liability claims and related expenses are determined using actuarially based techniques and methodologies 
the underlying data used to establish such reserves is based on asserted and unasserted claim information that has been accumulated by our incident reporting system  historical loss payment patterns and industry trends 
we discounted these long term liabilities to their estimated present values using discount rates of and at december  and  respectively 
we select a discount rate by estimating a risk free interest rate that correlates to the period when the claims are projected to be paid 
the discounted reserves are periodically reviewed and adjustments thereto are recorded as more information about claim trends becomes known to us 
as of december   a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have changed our professional liability reserve requirements by approximately million 
although the ultimate settlement of these liabilities may vary from our estimates  we believe that the amounts provided in the consolidated financial statements are reasonable and adequate 
however  if the actual claim payments and expenses exceed our projected estimates  our reserves could be materially adversely affected 
other self insured programs we provide income continuance and certain reimbursable health care costs collectively  workers compensation to our disabled employees and we provide health and welfare benefits to our employees  their spouses and certain beneficiaries 
such employee benefit programs are primarily self insured 
we record estimated liabilities for both reported and incurred but not reported workers compensation and health and welfare claims based on historical loss experience and other information provided by our third party administrators 
the long term liabilities for our workers compensation program are determined using actuarially based techniques and methodologies and are discounted to their estimated present values 
we select a discount rate that represents an estimated risk free interest rate correlating to the period when such benefits are projected to be paid 
as of december   a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would have changed our workers compensation reserve requirements by approximately million 
we believe that the estimated liabilities for these self insured programs are adequate and reasonable but there can be no assurances that the ultimate liability will not exceed our estimates 
if the costs of these programs exceed our estimates  the liabilities could be materially adversely affected 
legal and other loss contingencies we regularly review the status of our legal matters and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability 
significant judgment is required when determining probability and whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
predicting the final outcome of claims and lawsuits and estimating financial exposure involves substantial uncertainties and  therefore  actual costs may vary materially from our estimates 
when making determinations of likely outcomes of legal matters and the related financial exposure  we consider many factors  including  but not limited to  the nature of the claim including unasserted claims  the availability of insurance  our experience with similar types of claims  the jurisdiction where the matter is disputed  input from legal counsel  the likelihood of resolution through alternative dispute resolution means and the current status of the matter 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess our potential liability and  at that time  we may revise and adjust our estimates 
adjustments to liabilities reflect the status of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel and other relevant information 
changes in our estimates of the financial exposure for legal matters and other loss contingencies could have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding our material legal matters and loss contingencies 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements fair value measurements during september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which  among other things  established a framework for measuring fair value and required supplemental disclosures about such fair value measurements 
the modifications to current practice resulting from the application of this new accounting pronouncement primarily relate to the definition of fair value and the methods used to measure fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within the year of adoption  however  the fasb recently deferred sfas no 
for one year insofar as it relates to certain non financial assets and liabilities 
we do not believe that the adoption of this new accounting standard will materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
business combinations and noncontrolling interests during december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  sfas no 
r and sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
these accounting pronouncements are required to be adopted simultaneously and are effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   as well as interim periods within the year of adoption 
earlier adoption of these new accounting pronouncements is prohibited 
among other things  sfas no 
r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize i all and only assets acquired  liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interests of acquired businesses  ii contingent consideration arrangements at their acquisition date fair values subsequent changes in fair value are generally reflected in earnings  iii acquisition related transaction costs as expense when incurred  and iv non contractual contingencies at fair value on the acquisition date if they meet the more than likely threshold 
additionally  sfas no 
r establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
disclosure of the information necessary to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effects of a business combination must also be provided 
among other things  sfas no 
requires entities to report i noncontrolling minority interests as equity in their consolidated financial statements  ii earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests as part of consolidated earnings and not as a separate component of income or expense  and iii attribution of losses to the noncontrolling interest  even when those losses exceed the noncontrolling interest in the equity of the subsidiary 
sfas no 
also provides guidance for step transactions that differs significantly from current accounting practice 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
r and sfas no 
on january  due to the recent issuance of such accounting guidance and the complex analyses required thereunder  we have not yet determined the impact thereof on our consolidated financial statements 
convertible debt instruments on august   the fasb exposed for comment proposed fasb staff position apb a  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement  the exposure draft  which would  among other things  require the issuer of a convertible debt instrument to separately account for the liability and equity components thereof and reflect interest expense at the entity s market rate of borrowing for non convertible debt instruments 
if adopted  the exposure draft would require retrospective restatement of all periods presented with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on periods prior to those presented being recognized as of the beginning of the first period presented 
the exposure draft s proposed effective date would be the first reporting period beginning after december   including interim periods within the year of adoption  however  due to the fasb s redeliberations of the exposure draft  we believe that it is unlikely that the proposed effective date will be retained 
due to the complex analyses required  we have not yet determined the impact that the proposed accounting guidance set forth in the exposure draft would have on our consolidated financial statements if it were to be adopted in its current form 

table of contents results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes in item on december   we operated hospitals with a total of  licensed beds in non urban communities in alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  kentucky  mississippi  missouri  north carolina  oklahoma  pennsylvania  south carolina  tennessee  texas  washington and west virginia 
on july   we sold our two virginia based general acute care hospitals and certain affiliated entities with a combined total of licensed beds 
on february   we opened our de novo bed general acute care hospital in naples  florida 
subsequent to december   we closed gulf coast medical center  a bed general acute care hospital in biloxi  mississippi 
during the calendar year  we made certain changes and additions to our senior executive management team 
burke w 
whitman  who previously served as our president and chief operating officer  was named president and chief executive officer  succeeding joseph v 
vumbacco  and appointed to our board of directors 
mr 
vumbacco continued to serve as our vice chairman and a member of our board of directors until his retirement on december  additionally  kelly e 
curry was named executive vice president and chief operating officer effective july  and we hired a treasurer effective july  unless specifically indicated otherwise  the following discussion excludes our discontinued operations  which are identified at note to the consolidated financial statements in item other than i pre tax gains of approximately million and million from the dispositions of businesses and assets during the calendar year and the calendar year  respectively  and ii a pre tax long lived asset and goodwill impairment charge of million during the calendar year  such discontinued operations were not material to our consolidated results of operations during the periods presented herein 
the first full fiscal year affected by our change in fiscal year end from september to december was the calendar year 
in order to provide meaningful financial and other comparative operational analyses  we included herein unaudited consolidated financial information for the year ended december  the calendar year 
such unaudited financial information was derived from our unaudited results of operations during the last nine months of the fiscal year and the audited three month period 
during the calendar year  we experienced net revenue growth over the calendar year of approximately 
such net revenue growth resulted primarily from i our de novo general acute care hospital that opened on february   ii favorable case mix trends and iii improvements in reimbursement rates 
income from continuing operations and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations decreased by approximately million and  respectively  during the calendar year when compared to the calendar year 
offsetting the increase in net revenue during the calendar year and ultimately causing a year over year reduction in income from continuing operations were higher interest costs and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense 
when compared to the calendar year  the calendar year was favorably impacted by i a reduced provision for doubtful accounts  ii a decrease of approximately million in refinancing and debt modification costs and iii a lower effective income tax rate 
at our hospitals that were in operation as general acute care hospitals during all of the calendar year and the calendar year  which we refer to as same hospitals  emergency room visits increased approximately  however  corresponding same hospital admissions and surgical volume declined by and  respectively 
we recently implemented corrective action plans at certain hospitals to improve operating trends  including hiring new management teams  modifying physician employment agreements  renegotiating payor contracts and initiating patient physician employee satisfaction surveys 
furthermore  we continue to add physicians to our medical staffs and medical equipment to our hospitals in order to meet the needs of the communities that our hospitals serve 
we believe that  over time  these investments  coupled with improving demographics  will yield increased hospital surgical volume  emergency room visits and admissions 

table of contents outpatient services continue to play an important role in the delivery of health care in our markets  with approximately half of our net revenue during the calendar year and the calendar year generated on an outpatient basis 
we continue to improve our emergency room and diagnostic imaging services to meet the needs of the communities that our hospitals serve and we have invested capital in nearly every one of our hospitals during the last five years in one of these two areas 
as a result of this continuous focus  our same hospital adjusted admissions  which adjusts admissions for outpatient volume  increased approximately during the calendar year when compared to the calendar year 
economic conditions and changes in commercial health insurance benefit plans over the past several years have contributed to an increase in the number of uninsured and underinsured patients seeking health care in the united states 
this general industry trend has affected us 
our same hospital self pay admissions as a percent of total admissions increased to approximately during the calendar year  as compared to during the calendar year 
however  our same hospital self pay admissions as a percent of total admissions decreased basis points during the three months ended december  when compared to the three months ended september  in light of these trends  we regularly evaluate our policies and programs and consider changes or modifications as circumstances warrant

table of contents net revenue during the calendar year was approximately  million as compared to  million during the calendar year 
this change represented an increase of million or 
same hospitals provided approximately million  or  of the increase in net revenue as a result of increases in emergency room visits and reimbursement rates and favorable case mix trends 
the remaining million increase was primarily attributable to physicians regional medical center collier boulevard  our de novo general acute care hospital that opened on february   and physicians regional medical center pine ridge  which we acquired on may   offset by a million reduction in net revenue from business interruption insurance policy claims 
net revenue per adjusted admission at our same hospitals increased approximately during the calendar year as compared to the calendar year 
contributing factors to such change included increased patient acuity and the favorable effects of renegotiated agreements with certain commercial providers 
our provision for doubtful accounts during the calendar year decreased basis points to of net revenue compared to of net revenue during the calendar year 
as discussed at note g to the consolidated financial statements in item  during both the calendar year and the calendar year we modified our provision for doubtful accounts policy for self pay accounts receivable  resulting in the recognition of additional expenses of approximately million and million  respectively 
such accounting policy modifications contributed approximately basis points and basis points to the calendar year and the calendar year percentages  respectively 
excluding the impact of such accounting policy modifications  we experienced an increase of approximately basis points in the calendar year provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of net revenue 
such increase was primarily attributable to the increased prevalence of uninsured and underinsured patients in the mix of patients that we serve 
during the calendar year  the provision for doubtful accounts was partially offset by approximately million from the recovery of certain accounts receivable that were previously written off 
our consistently applied accounting policy is that accounts written off as charity and indigent care are not recognized in net revenue and  accordingly  such amounts have no impact on our provision for doubtful accounts 
however  as a measure of our fiscal performance  we routinely aggregate amounts pertaining to our i provision for doubtful accounts  ii uninsured self pay patient discounts and iii foregone unrecognized revenue for charity and indigent care and then we divide the resulting total by the sum of our i net revenue  ii uninsured self pay patient discounts and iii foregone unrecognized revenue for charity and indigent care 
we believe that this fiscal measure  which we refer to as our uncompensated patient care percentage  is important because it provides us with key information regarding the level of patient care for which we do not receive remuneration 
during the calendar year and the calendar year  such percentage was determined to be and  respectively 
the decrease during the calendar year compared to the calendar year includes the effects of the abovementioned accounting policy changes regarding our provision for doubtful accounts for self pay accounts receivable 
excluding the impact of such accounting policy modifications  we experienced an increase of approximately basis points in the calendar year uncompensated patient care percentage  which reflects  among other things  our increased volume of uninsured and underinsured patient activity  partially offset by the favorable impact of the aforementioned accounts receivable recovery 
salaries and benefits as a percent of net revenue increased to during the calendar year from during the calendar year 
same hospital salaries and benefits increased from of net revenue during the calendar year to during the calendar year 
these increases were primarily due to additional employed physicians and routine salary and wage increases during the calendar year 
depreciation and amortization as a percent of net revenue increased from during the calendar year to during the calendar year 
this increase primarily resulted from calendar year capital expenditures for renovation and expansion projects at certain of our facilities  new hospital construction and hospital replacement projects 
additionally  the intangible assets from our physician and physician group guarantees generated approximately million of incremental amortization expense during the calendar year 
other operating expenses as a percent of net revenue increased from during the calendar year to during the calendar year 
in addition to increased costs for professional fees  repairs and maintenance and advertising during the calendar year  the percent increase was due to incremental costs from our de novo general acute care hospital that opened on february  
table of contents during the calendar year  we recorded insurance claim recovery gains for renovations and equipment replacement approximating million 
no such amount was recognized during the calendar year 
interest expense increased from approximately million during the calendar year to million during the calendar year 
such increase was primarily attributable to i borrowings of billion in connection with the recapitalization of our balance sheet on march   ii non put payments  as defined and described in the third supplemental indenture with respect to our convertible senior subordinated notes due the notes and iii million of senior notes due that we issued on april  partially offsetting these increases were reduced costs from our revolving credit agreements due to limited borrowings thereunder during the calendar year 
see liquidity  capital resources and capital expenditures below and note to the consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion of our long term debt arrangements 
in connection with our january  repurchase of certain of our exchange zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due and the execution of the third supplemental indenture to the notes  we wrote off approximately million of deferred financing costs and incurred million of non capitalizable debt restructuring costs during the calendar year 
we also wrote off million of deferred financing costs during the calendar year in connection with the termination of our predecessor revolving credit agreement and redemptions of certain of our convertible notes 
non capitalizable debt restructuring costs and write offs of deferred financing costs have been recorded as refinancing and debt modification costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion of our convertible note repurchases and recent changes to our debt structure 
our effective income tax rates were approximately and during the calendar year and the calendar year  respectively 
our provision for income taxes was favorably impacted during the calendar year by  among other things  the finalization of our federal and state income tax returns  the lapsing of certain statutes of limitations and the conclusion of certain state audits

as discussed at note g to the consolidated financial statements in item  during both the calendar year and the calendar year we modified our provision for doubtful accounts policy for self pay accounts receivable  resulting in the recognition of additional expenses of approximately million and million  respectively 
such accounting policy modifications contributed approximately basis points and basis points to the calendar year and the calendar year percentages  respectively 
excluding the impact of such accounting policy modifications  there was an increase of approximately basis points in the calendar year provision for doubtful accounts as a percent of net revenue 
our uncompensated patient care percentage  which is described above under the heading calendar year compared to the calendar year  increased from during the calendar year to during the calendar year 
excluding the impact of the abovementioned accounting policy modifications  we experienced an increase of approximately basis points in the calendar year uncompensated patient care percentage 
these adverse trends in our uncompensated patient care percentage and our provision for doubtful accounts were primarily attributable to the increased prevalence of uninsured and underinsured patients in the mix of patients that we serve 
salaries and benefits as a percent of net revenue increased to during the calendar year from during the calendar year 
this increase was partially attributable to i the incremental impact of stock based compensation ie  an increase of approximately million in the calendar year over the calendar year and ii an increase in total employed physicians that primarily resulted from our may  acquisition of cleveland clinic naples hospital now known as physicians regional medical center pine ridge see note to the consolidated financial statements in item 
same hospital salaries and benefits were and of net revenue during the calendar year and the calendar year  respectively 
this increase was a result of our strategic initiatives to i hire more primary care physicians and family practitioners to improve and enhance referral patterns and ii employ physicians on a short term basis in order to facilitate their entry into markets where our hospitals operate 
supplies decreased as a percent of net revenue to during the calendar year from during the calendar year 
this decrease was due to the implementation of certain strategic sourcing agreements in high cost areas such as cardiovascular devices and increased utilization of our group purchasing organization  which resulted in increased rebates and discounts 
other operating expenses as a percent of net revenue increased from during the calendar year to during the calendar year 
in addition to increased costs for utilities  professional fees  property taxes  insurance and repairs and maintenance during the calendar year  the percent increase was due to higher costs at hospitals we acquired after december  during the calendar year  we recognized approximately million of gains on sales of i a medical office building and land in jackson  mississippi and ii two home health agencies 
during the calendar year and the calendar year  we also recorded insurance claim recovery gains for renovations and equipment replacement approximating million and million  respectively 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements in item interest expense increased from approximately million during the calendar year to million during the calendar year 
such change was attributable to i an increased weighted average revolving credit agreement outstanding balance during the calendar year when compared to the calendar year  ii higher effective interest rates during the calendar year and iii non put payments  as defined and described in the third supplemental indenture with respect to our notes 
borrowings under our revolving 
table of contents credit agreement during the calendar year resulted from acquisition activity and certain required income tax payments 
the repurchase of certain of our exchange zero coupon convertible senior subordinated notes due the new notes on january  caused our interest expense to increase by approximately million during the calendar year because the effective annual interest rate on the new notes ie  was substantially less than the effective interest rate on our senior notes due additionally  the note non put payments caused interest expense to increase by approximately million during the calendar year 
see liquidity  capital resources and capital expenditures below and note to the consolidated financial statements in item for further discussion of our long term debt arrangements 
in connection with our repurchase of certain of the new notes on january  and the execution of the third supplemental indenture to the notes  we wrote off approximately million of deferred financing costs and incurred approximately million of non capitalizable debt restructuring costs

despite lower net income and substantial growth in accounts receivable during the calendar year  we believe that efficient management of our other operating assets and liabilities led to stable cash flows from continuing operating activities during such period

days sales outstanding on february   we announced a number of financial and quality objectives for the calendar year  including days sales outstanding  or dso  which is calculated by dividing quarterly net revenue by the number of days in the quarter 
the result is divided into the net accounts receivable balance at the end of the quarter to 
table of contents obtain our dso 
we believe that this statistic is an important measure of collections on our accounts receivable 
our dso at december  was days  which compares to days at both september  and december  and is within our published dso objective range of days to days 
income taxes other than certain state net operating loss carryforwards  we believe that it is more likely than not that carrybacks  reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income will allow us to realize the deferred tax assets that are recognized in our consolidated balance sheets 
effect of legislative and regulatory action on liquidity the medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs are subject to change as a result of legislative and regulatory actions 
although we believe that changes will continue to limit reimbursement increases under those programs  we do not believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our future revenue or liquidity 
nevertheless  within the statutory framework of the medicare and medicaid programs  numerous areas are subject to administrative rulings  interpretations and discretion that could affect payments made to us 
in the future  federal and or state governments might i reduce the funds available under those programs in order to close budget gaps or reduce deficit spending or ii require more stringent utilization and quality reviews of hospital facilities  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and liquidity 
additionally  any future restructuring of the financing and delivery of health care services in the united states and or the continued prevalence of managed care health plans could have an adverse effect on our future revenue and liquidity 
capital resources sales of assets and related activities part of our plan to enhance cash flow during and beyond are sales of i hospitals and other health care business units that no longer meet our long term strategic objectives  ii certain corporate and hospital assets and iii the residual assets of our discontinued operations

there can be no assurances that we will successfully initiate and close any strategic transactions on satisfactory terms  if at all

credit facilities new senior secured credit facilities 
on march   we completed a recapitalization of our balance sheet the recapitalization wherein we entered into agreements for billion in new variable rate senior secured credit facilities the new credit facilities that closed on february  the new credit facilities were initially used to fund a special cash dividend of approximately billion and repay all amounts outstanding ie  million under our predecessor revolving credit agreement 
the new credit facilities consist of a seven year billion term loan the new term loan and a million six year revolving credit facility the new revolving credit agreement 
the recapitalization and the new credit facilities are discussed in further detail at note to the consolidated financial statements in item the new term loan requires i quarterly principal payments to amortize of the loan s original face value during each year of the loan s term and ii a balloon payment for the remaining outstanding loan balance at the termination of the agreement 
we are also required to repay principal under the new term loan in an amount that can be as much as of our annual excess cash flow  as such term is defined in the loan agreement 
the calendar year excess cash flow that will be repaid by us in is approximately million 
during the new revolving credit agreement s six year term  we are obligated to pay commitment fees based on the amounts available for borrowing 
additionally  the new revolving credit agreement has a million standby letter of credit limit 
amounts outstanding under the new credit facilities may be repaid at our option at any time  in whole or in part  without penalty 
we can elect whether interest on the new credit facilities  which is generally payable quarterly in arrears  utilizes libor or prime as its base rate 
the effective interest rate includes a spread above our selected base rate and is subject to modification in certain circumstances 
additionally  we may elect differing base interest rates for the new term loan and the new revolving credit agreement 
pursuant to the requirements of the agreements underlying the new credit facilities  we entered into a receive variable pay fixed interest rate swap contract  which provides for us to pay a fixed interest rate of on the notional amount of the interest rate swap contract for 
table of contents the seven year term of the new term loan 
at december   approximately million of the new term loan was not covered by the interest rate swap contract and  accordingly  such amount is subject to the new credit facilities variable interest rate provisions ie  effective interest rates of approximately and on december  and february   respectively 
our effective interest rate on the variable rate new revolving credit agreement  which is not covered by the aforementioned interest rate swap contract  was approximately on february  although there were no amounts outstanding under the new revolving credit agreement on such date  standby letters of credit in favor of third parties of approximately million reduced the amount available for borrowing thereunder to million on such date 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the new credit facilities  the manner in which we can redeem some or all of the notes as described below under the heading convertible debt securities is limited 
should we use future proceeds from the new credit facilities for such a redemption  we must meet certain financial ratios and  in some circumstances  we must maintain a specified minimum availability under the new revolving credit agreement 
if we elect to borrow funds other than under the new credit facilities or issue equity securities in order to fund a redemption of some or all of the notes  we will be subject to separate requirements  including  among other things  a requirement that we maintain compliance with certain financial ratios 
furthermore  as set forth under the new credit facilities  such additional borrowed funds must be in the form of either permitted subordinated indebtedness or permitted senior unsecured indebtedness 
we intend to fund the new term loan s quarterly interest payments and its required annual principal payments of million with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities  cash proceeds from our strategic transactions and or borrowings under the new revolving credit agreement 
promissory demand note 
we maintain a million unsecured demand promissory note in favor of a bank that is to be used as a working capital line of credit in conjunction with our cash management program 
pursuant to the terms and conditions of the demand promissory note  we may borrow and repay  on a revolving basis  up to the principal face amount of the note 
all principal and accrued interest outstanding under the demand promissory note will be immediately due and payable upon the bank s written demand 
absent such a demand  interest is payable monthly and determined using the libor market index rate  as that term is defined in the demand promissory note  plus 
the demand promissory note s effective interest rate on february  was approximately  however  there were no amounts outstanding thereunder on such date 
convertible debt securities notes 
at december   approximately million of the notes was outstanding 
the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes on august  for a cash purchase price per note equal to of the note s principal face amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
following the announcement of the recapitalization  our credit ratings were downgraded  which constituted a triggering event under the notes and caused such notes to become immediately convertible at the discretion of the noteholders 
subsequent to december   no holders of the notes have indicated to us an intent to convert their notes 
should some or all of the notes convert or if we are required to repurchase some or all of the notes on august   we intend to fund such transactions with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities  cash proceeds from our strategic transactions  borrowings under the new revolving credit agreement and or the issuance of new debt securities 
debt covenants the new credit facilities and the indentures governing the notes and the senior notes due contain covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with the financial and other covenants contained in those debt agreements 
although there can be no assurances  we believe that we will continue to comply with such debt covenants 
should we fail to comply with one or more of our debt covenants in the future and are unable to remedy the matter  an event of default may result 
in that circumstance  we would seek a waiver from our lenders or renegotiate the related debt agreement  however  such renegotiations could subject us to higher interest and financing costs on our debt obligations 

table of contents dividends on january   we announced that our board of directors had declared a special cash dividend  payable on march   of per share of common stock 
this special cash dividend  which was a component of the recapitalization  aggregated approximately billion and was funded with the net proceeds from the new term loan 
in light of the special cash dividend  we indefinitely suspended all future dividends 
additionally  the new credit facilities restrict our ability to pay cash dividends 
standby letters of credit at february   we maintained approximately million of standby letters of credit in favor of third parties with various expiration dates through october  should any or all of these letters of credit be drawn upon  we intend to satisfy such obligations with available cash balances  cash provided by operating activities and  if necessary  borrowings under the new revolving credit agreement 
capital expenditures we believe that recurring annual operational capital expenditures will approximate five to six percent of net revenue 
additionally  our long term business strategy may call for us to acquire additional hospitals that meet our acquisition criteria 
historically  acquisitions of hospitals accounted for a significant portion of our capital expenditures in any given fiscal year and or quarter 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for discussion of our recently completed acquisitions 
we generally fund acquisitions  replacement hospital construction and other recurring capital expenditures with available cash balances  cash generated from operating activities  amounts available under revolving credit agreements and proceeds from long term debt issuances  or a combination thereof 
however  we are currently evaluating several financing alternatives that would allow us to defray the cash basis cost of certain planned capital expenditures to future periods 
a number of hospital renovation and or expansion projects were underway at december  we do not believe that any of these projects are individually significant or that they represent  in the aggregate  a substantial commitment of our resources 
we are contractually obligated to commence construction of a replacement hospital at our monroe  georgia location on or before september  during march  the land parcel for such new hospital construction was acquired for cash 
we estimate that the cost to build the replacement hospital will range from million to million 
hospital divestitures as more fully discussed at note to our consolidated financial statements in item  we intend to divest i southwest regional medical center  a general acute care hospital in little rock  arkansas  and certain affiliated health care entities and ii gulf coast medical center  a general acute care hospital in biloxi  mississippi that we closed on january  however  the timing of such divestitures has not yet been determined 
we intend to use the proceeds from these divestitures and any other strategic transactions that we consummate to fund operations and reduce our outstanding debt 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements except as set forth in the table below  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
as of december   we had approximately million recorded as a liability for our interest rate swap contract and million recorded as a liability for unrecognized income tax benefits and related interest and penalties 
we excluded these amounts from the table below due to the uncertainty of the amounts to be paid  if any  as well as the timing of such payments 
as of december   contractual obligations for each of the next five years ending december and thereafter including principal and interest and other commitments are summarized in the table on the following page 
interest rates at december  were used in the table to estimate interest payments on variable rate debt

b obligations under operating leases for real property  real property master leases and equipment 
the real property master leases are leases for buildings on or near our hospitals for which we guarantee a certain level of rental income to the owners of the property 
we sublease space in these buildings to third parties 
future operating lease obligations are not recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
c see note p to the consolidated financial statements in item for information regarding physician and physician group guarantees and commitments 
d amounts relate to outstanding letters of credit with financial institutions 
the letters of credit principally serve as security for our workers compensation self insurance program  construction vendors and utility companies 
e other includes our replacement hospital construction in monroe  georgia and purchase commitments for supplies 
impact of seasonality and inflation seasonality we typically experience higher patient volume and net revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year because  generally  more people become ill during the winter months  which in turn increases the number of patients we treat during those months 
inflation the health care industry is labor intensive and subject to wage and related employee benefit expense increases  especially during periods of inflation and when there exists a shortage of skilled labor 
an ongoing skilled nursing staff shortage throughout the health care industry has caused nursing salaries to increase 
we have addressed our nursing staff needs by increasing wages  improving hospital working conditions and fostering relationships with local nursing schools 
we do not believe that the inflationary trend in nursing salaries or the nursing shortage will have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
suppliers  utility companies and other vendors pass on rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
we believe that we have been able to partially offset increases in our operating costs by increasing prices  achieving quantity discounts for purchases through our group purchasing agreement and efficiently utilizing our resources 
although we have implemented cost control measures to curb increases in operating costs  we cannot predict our ability to recover or offset future cost increases 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates pursuant to the requirements of the agreements underlying the new credit facilities  we entered into a receive variable pay fixed interest rate swap contract  which provides for us to pay a fixed interest rate of on the notional amount of the interest rate swap contract for the seven year term of the new term loan 
at december   we were exposed to interest rate fluctuations  primarily as a result of the million of variable rate new term loan that is not covered by our interest rate swap contract 
the interest rates on substantially all of our other long term debt at december  were fixed and  accordingly  a hypothetical change in interest rates would not have a material impact on us but increases in interest rates would correspondingly increase interest expense associated with any future borrowings 
at december   the fair value and carrying amount of our fixed rate debt  including capital lease obligations  were approximately  million and  million  respectively 
additionally  at such date  both the fair value and carrying amount of our variable rate debt was approximately million
