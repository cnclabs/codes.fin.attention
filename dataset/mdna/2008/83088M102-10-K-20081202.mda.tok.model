table of contents general during fiscal  certain key factors contributed to our overall results of operations and cash flows from operations 
more specifically we increased revenues by million  a increase for the fiscal year ended october   as compared to fiscal year this revenue growth was principally due to the ramp of new mobile platforms products  the addition of new customers  our entrance into new  adjacent markets and the expansion of our market share in increasingly complex front end modules at our existing customers 
we generated million in cash from operations for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal at october   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash 
we increased gross profit by million in the fiscal year ended october  as compared to fiscal year  reflecting a gross profit margin of  principally the result of a more favorable revenue mix  higher equipment efficiencies at our factories  progress on yield improvement initiatives  and year over year material cost reductions 
we increased operating income to million for fiscal  as compared to operating income of million in fiscal this increase in operating income was primarily the result of increases in revenues of  gross margin improvements driven by the yield improvement initiatives discussed above  equipment efficiencies  and year over year material cost reductions  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
in october  we paid million in cash to acquire certain assets from two separate companies 
we acquired raw materials  die bank  finished goods  proprietary gaas pa fem designs and related intellectual property in a business combination from freescale semiconductor 
we also acquired sixteen fundamental hbt and rf mems patents from another company in an asset acquisition 
in november  we retired the entire million balance of our convertible notes and in the process reduced the related potential dilution of stockholder ownership 
in september  we also retired million of our and convertible subordinated notes thereby further reducing related potential dilution of stockholder ownership by approximately million shares 
net revenues fiscal years ended october  september  september  dollars in thousands change change net revenues we market and sell our mobile platforms and linear products to top tier original equipment manufacturers oems of communication electronic products  third party original design manufacturers odms and contract manufacturers  and indirectly through electronic components distributors 
we periodically enter into strategic arrangements leveraging our broad intellectual property portfolio by licensing or selling our patents or other intellectual property 
we anticipate continuing this intellectual property strategy in future periods 
overall revenues in fiscal increased by million  or  from fiscal this revenue growth was principally due to the ramp of new mobile platform products  the addition of new mobile platform customers  diversification into new  adjacent markets and the expansion of our market share in increasingly complex front end modules at our existing customers 
net revenues from our top three customers decreased to for the fiscal year ended october  as compared to for the corresponding period in the prior year  reflecting continued 
table of contents expansion of our customer base 
average selling prices declined year over year compared to a decline of in the prior year 
overall revenues in fiscal declined by million  or  from fiscal due to the exit of our baseband product area at the end of fiscal year revenues from our mobile platforms and linear product areas remained relatively unchanged over that same period 
we experienced a more favorable product mix in fiscal which was offset by a decline in average selling prices of

gross profit fiscal years ended october  september  september  dollars in thousands change change gross profit of net revenues gross profit represents net revenues less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of purchased materials  labor and overhead including depreciation and equity based compensation expense associated with product manufacturing 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues improved to in fiscal year  from in fiscal year  and was principally the result of a more favorable revenue mix 
additionally  gross profit margin improved as a result of higher equipment efficiencies at all of our factories as our established hybrid manufacturing model with multiple external foundries allows us to maintain high internal capacity utilization by using second sources for high fixed cost services like foundry and assembly 
this approach provides supply chain flexibility  lower capital investment  the ability to meet upside demand and provides cost advantages 
furthermore  yield improvements and year over year material cost reductions along with the increased overall revenue contributed to the gross profit and margin improvement in both aggregate dollars and as a percentage of sales 
in fiscal year  we continued to benefit from higher contribution margins associated with the licensing and or sale of intellectual property 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues improved to in fiscal year  from in fiscal year  as higher gross profit margin mobile platforms and linear products became a greater percentage of our overall net revenues since we exited the lower margin baseband product area at the end of fiscal additionally  inventory related charges recorded in fiscal related to the exit of our baseband product area did not recur in fiscal furthermore  we improved absorption as our factory utilization increased and we experienced improved overall yields and greater equipment efficiency

the increase in research and development expenses in aggregate dollars for fiscal year when compared to fiscal year is principally attributable to increased labor and benefit costs and increases in elot and mask expenditures and variable materials and supplies expenses as we continued to invest in new product developments in both our mobile platforms and linear product areas 

table of contents the decrease in research and development expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year is predominantly attributable to decreased labor and benefit costs as a result of the workforce reductions associated with the exit of our baseband product area at the end of fiscal in addition  efficiencies were achieved in the utilization of outside services  fixed materials and supplies  rent costs  relocation costs  business travel and hardware software costs 
the reductions in the labor intensive research and development costs associated with the exit of our baseband product area enabled us to refocus  enhance and target our research and development spending on our higher growth core product areas in fiscal year selling  general and administrative fiscal years ended october  september  september  dollars in thousands change change selling  general and administrative of net revenues selling  general and administrative expenses include legal  accounting  treasury  human resources  information systems  customer service  bad debt expense  sales representative commissions  advertising  marketing and other costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in aggregate dollars for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  primarily due to higher share based compensation expense  higher incentive compensation costs and higher sales commissions 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as a result of the overall increase in net revenues along with selling  general and administrative costs increasing at a lower rate than the revenue growth rate 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year primarily due to our recording of million in bad debt expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal as we exited our baseband product area 
in addition  we incurred lower sales commissions and professional fees in fiscal amortization of intangible assets fiscal years ended october  september  september  dollars in thousands change change amortization of net revenues the increase in amortization expense during the fiscal year ended october  as compared to fiscal is due to the acquisitions completed in october and the associated amortizable customer relationships  patents  order backlog  foundry services agreement and developed technology that were acquired

the charge in lieu of tax expense resulted from a partial recognition of certain acquired tax benefits that were subject to a valuation allowance at the time of acquisition  the realization of which required a reduction of goodwill 
the fiscal united states income tax benefit of million is due to a million reduction in the valuation allowance related to the partial recognition of future tax benefits on united states federal and state net operating carryforwards and the reversal of million of tax reserve no longer required

accordingly  as of october   we have established a valuation allowance of million of which million relates to our united states deferred tax assets and million relates to our foreign operations 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating taxable income in the future 
the company considered several factors in evaluating the company s capacity to generate future earnings 
skyworks has produced a strong earnings trend generating cumulative earnings of million in fiscal years through in addition  revenue increased over and gross profit as a percentage of sales has improved in the last three years 
based on the aforementioned positive factors  skyworks projected future earnings to determine the realizability of our income tax benefit 
our projections considered the business uncertainty resulting from the current economic crisis  market forecasts and the cyclical nature of our business 
based on the company s evaluation of the realizability of its net deferred tax assets through the generation of future income  million of the company s valuation allowance was reversed at october  the amount reversed consisted of million recognized as income tax benefit  and million recognized as a reduction to goodwill 
the remaining valuation allowance as of october  is million 
when recognized  the tax benefits relating to any future reversal of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets will be accounted for as follows approximately million will be recognized as an income tax benefit  million will be recognized as a reduction to goodwill and million will be recognized as an increase to shareholders equity for certain tax deductions from employee stock options 
the company will continue to evaluate its valuation allowance in future periods and depending upon the outcome of that assessment  additional amounts could be reversed or recorded and recognized as a reduction to goodwill or an adjustment to income tax benefit or expense 
such adjustments could cause our effective income tax rate to vary in future periods 
we will need to generate million of future united states federal taxable income to utilize all of our net operating loss carryforwards  research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards  and deferred income tax temporary differences as of october  no provision has been made for united states  state  or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been or are intended to be permanently reinvested

the provisions of fin will be applied to all income tax provisions commencing from that date 
during the year ended october   the statute of limitations period expired relating to an unrecognized tax benefit

including this reversal  total year to date accrued interest related to the company s unrecognized tax benefits was a benefit of million 
of the total unrecognized tax benefits at october   million would impact the effective tax rate  if recognized 
there are no positions which we anticipate could change within the next twelve months

liquidity and capital resources fiscal years ended october  september  september  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities cash and cash equivalents at end of period fiscal based on our results of operations for fiscal  along with current trends  we expect our existing sources of liquidity  together with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to fund our research and development  capital expenditures  debt obligations  working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  we cannot be certain that the capital required to fund these expenses will be available in the future 
in addition  any strategic investments and acquisitions that we may make to help us grow our business may require additional capital resources 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital to meet our capital needs on a timely basis and on favorable terms if at all  our business and operations could be materially adversely affected 
cash and cash equivalent balances decreased million to million at october  from million at september  we generated million in cash from operations during the fiscal year ended october   which was offset by the retirement of million of junior notes  million of the convertible notes  capital expenditures of million and expenditures on acquisitions of million 
the number of days sales outstanding for the fiscal year ended october  decreased to from for fiscal during fiscal  we generated net income of million

cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended october   consisted of net sales of million in auction rate securities and investments in capital equipment of million primarily to expand fabrication and assembly and test capacity 
we believe a focused program of capital expenditures will be required to sustain our current manufacturing capabilities 
we expect that future capital expenditures will be funded by the generation of positive cash flows from operations 
in addition  we paid million in cash to acquire certain assets from two separate companies 
we acquired freescale semiconductor s handset power amplifier business and also acquired patents from another company 
we may also consider additional future acquisition opportunities to extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings

at october   we also held a million auction rate security which historically has provided liquidity through a dutch auction process 
the recent disruptions in the credit markets have substantially eliminated the liquidity of this process resulting in failed auctions 
during the fiscal year ended october   we performed a comprehensive valuation and discounted cash flow analysis on the auction rate security 
we concluded the value of the auction rate security was million  and the carrying value of these securities was reduced by million  reflecting this change in fair value 
accordingly  in the fiscal year ended october   we recorded unrealized losses on this auction rate security of approximately million 
we assessed these declines in fair market value to be temporary and consider the security to be illiquid until there is a successful auction 
accordingly  the remaining auction rate security balance has been reclassified to non current other assets and the loss has been recorded in other comprehensive income 
we will continue to monitor the liquidity and accounting classification of this security in future periods 
if in a future period  we determine that the impairment is other than temporary  we will impair the security to its fair value and charge the loss to earnings 
after the close of fiscal  we retired an additional million of our convertible notes due in at an average discounted price of per of par value 
these retirements reduced the remaining principal balance on our convertible notes to million as of november  on july   we entered into a receivables purchase agreement under which we have agreed to sell from time to time certain of our accounts receivable to skyworks usa  inc skyworks usa  a wholly owned special purpose entity that is fully consolidated for accounting purposes

in fiscal  we also experienced a decrease in accounts payable balances of million  a decrease in other accrued liability balances of million and an increase in receivable balances of million 
furthermore  we experienced an increase in deferred tax assets of million primarily resulting from the partial release of our tax valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of fiscal finally  provision for losses on accounts receivable increased by million principally due to further reserves recorded for baseband product area customers 
during fiscal  we utilized million in cash from investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities in fiscal consisted of net proceeds of million from the sale of auction rate securities 
capital expenditures of million offset these net proceeds and were primarily related to the purchase of equipment utilized in our fabrication facilities to support and enhance our assembly and test capacity 

table of contents during fiscal  we generated million in cash from financing activities 
this principally resulted from the issuance of our convertible notes offering which generated gross proceeds of million  and stock option exercises of million  offset by repayment of million on our junior notes  a common stock buyback of million shares at a cost of approximately million  and financing costs associated with our convertible notes offering of million

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from product sales are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title  in accordance with the shipping terms specified in the arrangement with the customer 
revenue from license fees and intellectual property is recognized when these fees are due and payable  and all other criteria of sec staff accounting bulletin no

we ship product on consignment to certain customers and only recognize revenue when the customer notifies us that the inventory has been consumed 
revenue recognition is deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete 
certain product sales are made to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for price protection and or a right of return on unsold products 
a reserve for sales returns and allowances for customers is recorded based on historical experience or specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
the company provides for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
the recoverability of inventories is assessed through an on going review of inventory levels in relation to sales backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycles 
when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand generally in excess of twelve months  the value of such inventory that is not expected to be sold at the time of the review is written down 
the amount of the write down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value generally zero 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
some or all of the inventories that have been written down may be retained and made available for sale 
in the event that actual demand is higher than originally projected  a portion of these inventories may be able to be sold in the future 
inventories that have been written down and are identified as obsolete are generally scrapped

as share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended october  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
upon adoption of sfas r  the company elected to retain its method of valuation for share based awards using the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model which was also previously used for the company s pro forma information required under sfas the company s determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by the company s stock price 
table of contents as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the company s expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
for more complex awards with market based performance conditions  the company employs a monte carlo simulation method which calculates many potential outcomes for an award and establishes fair value based on the most likely outcome 
sfas r requires the company to evaluate and periodically validate several assumptions in conjunction with calculating share based compensation expense 
these assumptions include the expected life of a stock option or other equity based award  expected volatility  pre vesting forfeiture  risk free rate and expected dividend yield 
all of these assumptions affect to one degree or another  the valuation of the company s equity based awards or the recognition of the resulting share based compensation expense 
the most significant assumptions in the company s calculations are described below 
expected life of an option or other equity based award since employee options are non transferable  sfas r allows the use of an expected life to more accurately estimate the value of an employee stock option rather than using the full contractual term 
the vesting of the majority of the company s stock options are graded over four years at each anniversary and the contractual term is either years or years 
the company analyzed its historical exercise experience and exercise behavior by job group 
the company analyzed the following three exercise metrics exercise at full vesting  exercise at midpoint in the contractual life and exercise at the end of the full contractual term 
the company chose the mid point alternative as the estimate which most closely approximated actual exercise experience of its employee population 
the valuation and resulting share based compensation expense recorded is sensitive to what alternative is chosen and the choice of another alternative in the future could result in a material difference in the amount of share based compensation expense recorded in a reporting period 
expected volatility expected volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to fluctuate during a period 
sfas r does not specify a method for estimating expected volatility  instead it provides a list of factors that should be considered when estimating volatility historical volatility that is generally commensurate with the expected option life  implied volatilities  the length of time a stock has been publicly traded  regular intervals for price observations  corporate and capital structure and the possibility of mean reversion 
the company analyzed its volatility history and determined that the selection of a weighting of to historical volatility and to implied volatility as measured by examining the underlying volatility in the open market of publicly traded call options would provide the best estimate of expected future volatility of the stock price 
the selection of another methodology to calculate volatility or even a different weighting between implied volatility and historical volatility could materially impact the valuation of stock options and other equity based awards and the resulting amount of share based compensation expense recorded in a reporting period 
pre vesting forfeiture sfas r specifies that initial accruals of share based compensation expense should be based on the estimated number of instruments for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 
the company examined its options forfeiture history and computed an average annualized forfeiture percentage 
the company determined that a weighted average of historical annualized forfeitures is the best estimate of future actual forfeiture experience 
the application of a different methodology for calculating estimated forfeitures could materially impact the amount of share based compensation expense recorded in a reporting period 
valuation of long lived assets carrying values for long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets  which excludes goodwill  are reviewed for possible impairment as circumstances warrant in connection with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
impairment reviews are conducted at the judgment of management whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
table of contents that the carrying amount of any such asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
the company s estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to the company s business model or changes in its operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of an asset or asset group  the company recognizes an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset or asset group 
fair value is determined using discounted cash flows 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested at least annually for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process 
the first step of the impairment analysis compares the company s fair value to its net book value to determine if there is an indicator of impairment 
in determining fair value  sfas no 
allows for the use of several valuation methodologies  although it states quoted market prices are the best evidence of fair value 
the company calculates fair value using the average market price of its common stock over a seven day period surrounding the annual impairment testing date of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter and the number of shares of common stock outstanding on the date of the annual impairment test the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter 
if the assessment in the first step indicates impairment then the company performs step two 
step two of the analysis compares the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation for a business combination 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
intangible assets are tested for impairment using an estimate of discounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
we test our goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually as of the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets may be impaired 
indicators such as unexpected adverse business conditions  economic factors  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities  loss of key personnel  and acts by governments and courts  may signal that an asset has become impaired 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
this method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the adequacy of the valuation allowance quarterly 
likewise  in the event that the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income or decrease the carrying value of goodwill in the period such determination was made 
the calculation of our tax liabilities includes addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
with the implementation effective september   fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 

table of contents we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on our recognition threshold and measurement attribute of whether it is more likely than not that the positions we have taken in tax filings will be sustained upon tax audit  and the extent to which  additional taxes would be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period in which it is determined the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if the estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment  a further charge to expense would result

table of contents other matters inflation did not have a material impact upon our results of operations during the three year period ended october  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to foreign currency  market rate and interest risks as described below investment and interest rate risk our exposure to interest and market risks relates principally to our investment portfolio  which as of october  consisted of the following in thousands cash and cash equivalents time deposits  overnight repurchase agreements and money market funds restricted cash time deposits and certificates of deposit available for sale securities auction rate securities our main investment objective is the preservation of investment capital 
our policy is to invest with only high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or investment purposes 
our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
we are however  subject to overall financial market risks  such as changes in market liquidity  credit quality and interest rates 
available for sale securities carry a longer maturity period contractual maturities exceed ten years 
in fiscal we experienced a temporary unrealized loss on our investment in auction rate securities primarily caused by a disruption in the liquidity of the dutch auction process which resets interest rates each month 
we classified auction rate securities in prior periods as current assets under short term investments 
in fiscal  we determined the fair value of our auction rate securities to be million 
given the failed auctions  the auction rate securities are effectively illiquid until there is a successful auction 
accordingly  the remaining auction rate securities balance has been reclassified to non current other assets 
we believe we have the ability to hold these investments until the lack of liquidity in these markets is resolved or they mature 
if current market conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record additional unrealized losses 
if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate  the anticipated recovery in market values does not occur  or we need funds from the auction rate securities to meet working capital needs  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through impairment charges recorded to earnings as appropriate  which could be material 
our short term debt consists of borrowings under our credit facility with wachovia bank  na of million 
interest related to our borrowings under our credit facility with wachovia bank  na is at libor plus and was approximately at october  consequently  we do not have significant cash flow exposure on this short term debt 
our long term debt at november  consists of million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes convertible notes 
these convertible notes contain cash settlement provisions  which permit the application of the treasury stock method in determining potential share dilution of the conversion spread should the share price of the company s common stock exceed 
it has been the company s historical practice to cash settle the principal and interest components of convertible debt instruments  and it is our intention to continue to do so in the future  including settlement of the convertible notes issued in march these shares have not been included in the computation of earnings per share for the fiscal year ended october   as their effect would have been anti dilutive 
exchange rate risk substantially all sales to customers and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  thereby reducing the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results 
a small percentage of our international operational expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
exchange rate volatility could negatively or positively impact those operating costs 
for the fiscal years ended october   september   and september   the company incurred unrealized foreign exchange gains losses of million  million  and million  respectively 
increases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the us dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices to continue doing business with us 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a greater effect on our business in the future to the extent our expenses increasingly become denominated in foreign currencies
