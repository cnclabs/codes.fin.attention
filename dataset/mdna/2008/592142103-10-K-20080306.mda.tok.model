item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations as of december   substantially all of our revenue was directly or indirectly derived from reimbursements generated by medicare advantage health plans 
as a result  our revenue and profitability are dependent on government funding levels for medicare advantage programs 
see item description of business medicare  medicare modernization act 
for the twelve months ended december   approximately of our revenue came from the humana agreements 
the humana agreements have one year terms and renew automatically each december for additional one year terms unless terminated for cause or upon days prior notice 
failure to maintain the humana agreements on favorable terms would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
the humana agreements are risk 
del del 
agreements under which the psn  receives monthly payments per humana participating customer at a rate established by the agreements  also called a capitation fee 
in accordance with the agreements  the capitation fee is a function of the number of humana participating customers  regardless of the actual utilization rate of covered services 
the hmo s revenue is generated by premiums consisting of monthly payments per customer that are established by the cms contract and through the competitive bidding process 
the hmo contracts directly with cms and is paid a monthly premium payment for each customer enrolled in our plan 
among other things  the monthly premium varies by patient  county  age and severity of health status 
to the extent that the humana participating customers or the hmo s customers require more or costlier care than is anticipated  aggregate capitation fees may be insufficient to cover the costs associated with the treatment of such customers 
if medical expenses exceed our estimates  except in very limited circumstances  we will be unable to increase the premiums we receive under these contracts during the then current terms 
relatively small changes in our ratio of medical expense to revenue can create significant changes in our financial results 
accordingly  the failure to adequately predict and control medical expenses and to make reasonable estimates and maintain adequate accruals for incurred but not reported ibnr claims  may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
see item a 
risk factors for further discussion of the most significant risks that affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and or cash flows 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the accompanying financial statements 
actual results may ultimately differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  including those that are perceived to be the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require complex and or subjective judgments by management 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies include use of estimates  revenue  expense and receivables and use of estimates  deferred tax asset 
use of estimates  revenue  expense and receivables 
our revenue is primarily derived from risk based health insurance arrangements in which the premium is fixed and paid to us on a monthly basis 
we assume the economic risk of funding our customers health care services and related administrative costs 
premium revenue is recognized in the period in which eligible individuals are entitled to receive health care services 
because we have the obligation to fund medical expenses  we recognize gross revenue and medical expenses for these contracts in our consolidated financial statements 
we record health care premium payments we receive in advance of the service period as unearned premiums 
cms periodically retroactively adjusts the premiums paid to us based on the updated health status of our customers 
the factors considered in this update include changes in demographic factors  risk adjustment scores  customer information and adjustments required by the risk sharing requirements for prescription drug benefits under part d of the medicare program 
in addition  cms also retroactively adjusts the number of customers enrolled in our hmo or psn as a result of enrollment discrepancies 
these retroactive adjustments could  in the near term  materially impact the revenue that has been recorded by us for both our hmo and psn 
we record any adjustments to this revenue at the time the information necessary to make the determination of the adjustment is available and the collectibility of the amount is reasonably assured 
medical expenses for both the psn and hmo are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of our obligations for medical services that have been provided to our customers but for which we have neither received or processed claims  and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical expense disputes 
we estimate liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical expense disputes based upon an analysis of potential outcomes  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
we develop our estimated medical claims payable by using an actuarial process that is consistently applied 
the actuarial models consider factors such as time from date of service to claim receipt  claim backlogs  care provider contract rate changes  medical care consumption and other medical expense trends 
the actuarial process and models develop a range of projected medical claims payable and we record to the amount within the range that is our best estimate of the ultimate liability 
each period we re examine previously established medical claims payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances 
as the estimate of medical claims payable recorded in prior periods become more exact  we adjust the amount of our liability estimates  and include the changes in such estimates in medical expense in the period in which the change is identified 
in each reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical expense payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
while we believe our medical expenses payable are adequate to cover future claims payments required  such estimates are based on claims experience to date and various assumptions 
therefore  the actual liability could differ materially from the amounts recorded 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements and risk factors a failure to estimate incurred but not reported use of estimates  deferred tax asset 
we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 or fas  accounting for income taxes  as clarified by fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes interpretation no 

under this method  deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  estimates of future taxable income  and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria of fas no 
interpretation no 
requires that we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
in the event we determine that we cannot  on a more likely than not basis  realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to establish a deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination is made

 business combinations statement no 

statement no 
r fundamentally changes many aspects of existing accounting requirements for business combinations 
it requires  among other things  the accounting for any entity in a business combination to recognize the full value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction at the acquisition date  the immediate expense recognition of transaction costs  and accounting for restructuring plans separately from the business combination 
statement no 
r defines the acquirer as the entity that obtains control of one or more businesses in the business combination and establishes the acquisition date as the date that the acquirer achieves control 
statement no 
r retains the guidance in statement no 
for identifying and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill 
if we enter into any business combination after the adoption of statement no

off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenue or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors 
contractual obligations and other contractual commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payment due by period contractual less than more than obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations service agreements employment obligations other as of december   we had no outstanding long term debt and no payment obligations that would constitute capital lease obligations 
impact of inflation inflation has a significant impact on the cost of medical care 
according to a report issued in january by the office of the actuary at cms  health care outlays are projected to grow at a rate of annually between and the principal projected drivers for this growth include continued cost increasing medical innovation  inflation  continued strong demand for prescription drugs and the aging baby boomer demographic 
we seek to minimize the impact of these increases by developing fixed fee or capitation arrangements with our healthcare providers that run for multiple years and which include built in price increases that are more in line with the projected increases in medicare reimbursement  which we are estimating to be approximately annually 
comparison of and summary we operated in two financial reporting segments  the psn business and the hmo business in both and for the year ended december   we realized revenue of million compared to million in the prior year  an increase of approximately million or 
medical expenses for were million  an increase of million or over our ratio of medical expense to revenue the medical expense ratio or mer decreased to in compared to in income before income taxes for was million compared to  in the psn reported a segment gain before income taxes and allocated overhead of million for the year ended december   compared to million for  an increase of million or 
the hmo segment incurred a loss before income taxes and allocated overhead of million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million in  a decrease of 
allocated overhead amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net income for was million compared to  for the year ended december  net earnings per share  basic was and net earnings per share  diluted was for compared to for customer information the table set forth below provides i the total number of customers to whom we were providing healthcare services through the psn and hmo as of december  and and ii the aggregate customers months for the psn and the hmo during and customer months are the aggregate number of months of healthcare services we have provided to our customers during a period of time 
customers at december customer months in percentage change in customer months between years psn hmo total at february  the hmo had approximately  customers and the psn had approximately  customers we implemented a restructuring plan  in july  designed to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
the restructuring plan  which was completed by the end of august  resulted in the closure of  among other things  one psn medical practice the closed psn practice 
at the time of its closure on july   the closed psn practice served approximately humana participating customers in south florida  all of which were moved to other providers outside of our psn 
revenue the following table provides a breakdown of our sources of revenue 
year ended december increase decrease change psn revenue from humana psn fee for service revenue total psn revenue percentage of total revenue hmo revenue percentage of total revenue total revenue the psn s most significant source of revenue during both and was the premium revenue generated pursuant to the humana agreements the humana related revenue 
the humana related revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of approximately 
the increase in the humana related revenue is primarily attributable to premium increases and the increase in the medicare risk score attributable to the humana participating customers 
the average premium per customer per month premium increased approximately in as compared to this premium increase was partially offset by a decrease in humana participating customer months from  in to  in  which lowered humana related revenue by approximately million 
the decline in humana participating customer months in from was partially a result of the closing of one of the psn medical offices in august and customer attrition due to deaths  relocations and transfers to other insurance plans 
based on the payments we have received from humana in early  we believe that the per customer per month premium from humana will increase approximately to from  excluding any potential change from the current medicare risk score of these individuals 
the fee for service revenue represents amounts earned from medical services provided to non humana customers in our owned physician practices 
revenue for the hmo was million in as compared to million in the increase in revenue in is primarily attributable to the increase in our customer months during and a increase in the per customer per month premium from cms in as compared to total medical expense total medical expense represents the estimated total cost of providing patient care and is comprised of two components  medical claims expense and medical center costs 
medical claims expense for both the psn and hmo are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of our obligations for medical services that have been provided to our customers but for which we have neither received nor processed claims  and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical expense disputes 
medical claims expense includes such costs as inpatient and outpatient services  pharmacy benefits and physician services by providers other than the physician practices owned by the psn collectively non affiliated providers 
medical center costs represent the operating costs of the physician practices owned by the psn 
we develop our estimated medical expenses payable by using an actuarial process that is consistently applied 
the actuarial process develops a range of estimated medical expenses payable and we record to the amount in the range that is our best estimate of the ultimate liability 
each period  we re examine previously recorded medical claims payable estimates based on actual claim submissions and other changes in facts and circumstances 
as medical expenses recorded in prior periods becomes more exact  we adjust the amount of the estimate  and include the change in medical expense in the period in which the change is identified 
in each reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical expense payable estimates associated with previously reported periods 
while we believe our estimated medical expenses payable is adequate to cover future claims payments required  such estimates are based on our claims experience to date and various management assumptions 
therefore  the actual liability could differ materially from the amount recorded 
total medical expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our reported medical expense ratio decreased from in to in the current year 
approximately million or of our total medical expenses in are attributable to medical claims expense such as inpatient and outpatient services  pharmacy benefits and physician services by non affiliated providers 
in  approximately million or of our total medical expenses were attributable to medical claims expense 
year ended december  hmo psn consolidated hmo psn consolidated estimated medical expense for the year  excluding prior period claims development favorable unfavorable prior period medical claims development in current year based on actual claims submitted total reported medical expense for the year reported medical expense ratio for year in the table above  favorable adjustments to amounts we recorded in prior periods for estimated claims payable appear in parentheses while unfavorable adjustments do not appear in parentheses 
favorable adjustments reduce total medical expense for the respective applicable period and unfavorable claims development increases total medical expense for the applicable period 
because the humana agreements provide that the psn is financially responsible for all medical services provided to the humana participating customers  medical claims expense includes the cost of medical services provided to humana participating customers by providers other than the psn s affiliated providers non affiliated providers 
the reported medical expense ratio for the psn decreased to in as compared to in during  the psn realized the benefit of the various medical management techniques implemented in to improve the medical management of our customers 
we believe that the impact of these techniques is a primary reason for the psn s reduced mer 
the psn s medical claims expense increased by approximately million or  primarily as a result of higher medical costs associated with our psn customers increasing medical needs as indicated by the higher risk scores in medical center costs include the salaries  taxes and benefits of the psn s affiliated health professionals providing primary care services  as well as other costs associated with the operations of those practices 
approximately million of our total medical expenses in related to physician practices we own as compared to million in the reported medical expense ratio for the hmo declined to in from in this decline is primarily a result of our ability to renegotiate certain contracts with hospitals and outpatient service providers in that reduced the amount we paid for services provided 
in addition  during  the hmo made improvements to the pre approval process for medical services provided to the hmo s customers and medical management processes were enhanced 
partially as a result of these efforts  we realized a decrease in the per customer medical expense cost 
total medical expense for the hmo in increased by million over that incurred in primarily as a result of the increased customer months in the reported medical expense ratio is impacted by both revenue and expense 
retroactive adjustments of prior period premiums that are recorded in the current period impact the mer of that period 
if the retroactive adjustment increases revenue of the period then the impact reduces the recorded mer 
conversely  if the retroactive adjustment reduces revenue of the period  then the mer for the period is higher 
these retroactive adjustments include  among other things  the mid year and annual risk score premium adjustments and settlement of part d program premiums 
in addition  actual medical claims expense usually develops differently than estimated during the period 
therefore  the reported mer shown in the above table will likely change as additional claims development occurs 
favorable claims development is a result of actual medical claim cost for prior periods developing lower than the original estimated cost which reduces the reported medical expense and the mer for the current period 
unfavorable claims development is a result of actual medical claim cost for prior periods exceeding the original estimated cost which increases total reported medical expense and the mer for the current period 
for the psn  a change in either revenue or medical claims expense of approximately million impacts the psn s mer by in and a change of million impacts the psn s mer by in a change of approximately  in in either revenue or medical claims expense impacts the mer for the hmo by 
in  a change in either revenue or medical claims expense of approximately  impacts the hmo s mer by 
the estimated medical expense payable for the psn at december  was determined to be between million and million and  as is our policy  we recorded a liability at million  the actuarial mid point of the range 
at december   the estimated medical expenses payable was estimated to be million compared to actual claims paid in for of million  a difference of million 
this million difference increased the psn s medical expense in and increased the psn s medical expense ratio by 
at december   we estimated our estimated medical expense payable for the hmo was between million and million and we recorded a liability of million 
at december   our estimated medical expense payable for the hmo was estimated to be million 
claims paid in for totaled million which was less than the estimated accrual by  this difference was recorded as a reduction in claims expense in and reduced the hmo s medical expense ratio by 
operating expenses year ended december increase change administrative payroll  payroll taxes and benefits percentage of total revenue marketing and advertising percentage of total revenue restructuring expense percentage of total revenue general and administrative percentage of total revenue total operating expenses administrative payroll  payroll taxes and benefits administrative payroll  payroll taxes and benefits include salaries and related costs for our executive  administrative and sales staff 
for  administrative payroll  payroll taxes and benefits were million  compared to the prior year s total of million in  an increase of million 
a portion of this increase was a direct result of the additional administrative personnel required as a result of the increase in the hmo s customer months during this growth was the primary reason payroll  payroll taxes and benefit costs associated with the hmo segment were million in as compared to million in  an increase of approximately 
corporate payroll  payroll taxes and benefits increased from million to million  an increase of million or 
this increase is primarily the result of a  charge relating to a mutually agreeable separation agreement with the individual who served as our president and chief operating officer until april  in addition  the bonus expense awarded to our employees  which is based primarily on our operating results  was approximately  higher than that of marketing and advertising marketing and advertising expense  which primarily consists of advertising expenses and brokerage commissions paid to independent sales agents  was million in as compared to million in  an increase of 
the increase primarily related to additional marketing costs and commissions the hmo incurred in marketing its plans during the special enrollment period afforded customers of a competing medicare advantage plan that had its contract terminated by cms in july restructuring expense in july  we implemented a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
the restructuring plan  which was completed by the end of august  resulted in the closure of one psn medical practice  two of the hmo s office locations  and a workforce reduction involving employees 
in connection with this plan  we recorded approximately  of restructuring costs during the third quarter of including approximately  for severance payments  approximately  for continuing lease obligations on closed locations and approximately  for the write off of certain leasehold improvements and equipment 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million in as compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
approximately million of this increase is attributable to the hmo 
as a result of the increase in customer months  the hmo incurred increased costs for claims processing and customer services of million 
in addition  fees for actuarial services increased by  over which increase primarily related to  among other things  the plan design and bid process for the hmo and development of cost data to assist the hmo in identifying areas where costs could be reduced 
in addition  fees paid to our board of directors increased in by  over the amount paid in  professional service costs increased approximately  and depreciation expense increased by  other income expense we realized other income of million in compared to million in the increase was primarily as a result of an increase in investment income of  as we had more cash to invest and interest rates increased over for most of cash is invested in highly liquid securities  primarily bond funds with short term maturities and money market funds 
we expect to continue to invest our excess cash in this manner in income taxes the results included income taxes of approximately million  as compared to  in this difference is a result of the increase in pre tax income between and comparison of and summary in and  we operated in two financial reporting segments  the psn business and the hmo business 
the hmo business commenced operations in july for the year ended december   we realized revenue of million compared to million in the prior year  an increase of approximately million or 
medical expenses for were million  an increase of million over our medical expense ratio increased to in compared to in as described below  effective july   the hmo began to provide services and realize revenue as compared to a full year of operations in income before income taxes for was  compared to million in the psn reported a segment gain before income taxes and allocated overhead of million for the year ended december   an increase of million or a increase as compared to the prior year 
the hmo segment  which commenced operations in july  incurred a net loss before income taxes and allocated overhead of million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million in allocated overhead amounted to million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
our results of operations for  like those of  were negatively impacted by the losses related to the operations of our medicare advantage hmo 
net income for was  compared to million for the year ended december  net earnings per share  basic and diluted was for compared to for the decrease in the basic net earnings per share in  while primarily due to the decrease in net income  is also partially affected by the increase in the number of weighted average shares outstanding  from  in to  in the majority of the shares issued during relate to shares issued upon the exercise of stock options 
customer information the table set forth below provides i the total number of customers to whom we were providing healthcare services through the psn and hmo as of december  and december  and ii the aggregate customers months for the psn and the hmo during and customer months are the aggregate number of months of healthcare services we have provided to our customers during a period of time 
customers at december customer months in percentage change in customer months between years psn hmo total in august  the psn discontinued its contractual relationship with one of its south florida based physician practices providing care to approximately of the humana participating customers and discontinued our contractual relationship with two additional south florida based physician practices providing care to approximately of the humana participating customers due to non compliance with our policies and procedures 
for the nine months ended september   the revenue and medical expenses related to these practices were million and million  respectively  resulting in a medical expense ratio of and a net loss of approximately  revenue the following table provides a breakdown of our sources of revenue 
year ended december  increase change psn revenue from humana psn fee for service revenue total psn revenue percentage of total revenue hmo revenue percentage of total revenue total revenue the psn s significant source of revenue during both and was the premium revenue generated pursuant to the humana agreements the humana related revenue 
the humana related revenue increased from million in to million in  an increase of approximately 
the increase in humana related revenue in the humana increase is primarily attributable to approximately million in premium increases of which million of the increase related to medicare part d  and medicare risk adjustments mra that were retroactively approved by cms in for and approximately  of the humana increase 
this humana increase was partially offset by a decrease in humana participating customer months from  in to  in  which decreased humana related revenue by approximately million 
as previously discussed  the decline in customer months in from was primarily a result of the termination of the contractual relationship with certain physicians during the last half of the psn s average per customer per month premium increased during approximately in the central florida market and in the south florida market as compared to this increase is substantially due to the part d premium  which began in the fee for service revenue represents amounts earned from medical services provided to non humana customers in our owned physician practices 
revenue for the hmo was million in as compared to million in the hmo began generating revenue during the last two quarters of the increase in revenue in is primarily attributable to the increase in our customer base during and the operation of the hmo for the full year 
included in the hmo s revenue is approximately  attributable to mra scores that were retroactively approved by cms in for total medical expense total medical expense represents the estimated total cost of providing patient care and is comprised of two components  medical claims expense and medical center costs 
medical claims expense for both the psn and hmo are recognized in the period in which services are provided and include an estimate of our obligations for medical services that have been provided to our customers but for which we have either not yet received or processed claims  and for liabilities for physician  hospital and other medical expense disputes

total medical expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our medical expense ratio increased from in to in approximately million or of our total medical expenses in are attributable to medical claims such as inpatient and outpatient services  pharmacy benefits and physician services by non affiliated providers 
in  approximately million or of our total medical expenses were attributable to medical claims year ended december  hmo psn consolidated hmo psn consolidated estimated medical expense for the year  excluding prior period claims development favorable unfavorable prior period medical claims development in current year based on actual claims submitted total reported medical expense for the year reported medical expense ratio for year in the table above  favorable adjustments to amounts we recorded in prior periods for estimated claims payable appear in parentheses while unfavorable adjustments do not appear in parentheses 
favorable adjustments reduce total medical expense for the respective applicable period and unfavorable claims development increases total medical expense for the applicable period 
because the humana agreements provide that the psn is financially responsible for all medical services provided to the humana participating customers  medical claims expense includes the cost of medical services provided to humana participating customers by non affiliated providers 
the reported medical expense ratio for the psn decreased to in as compared to in during  the psn implemented various medical management techniques to improve the medical management of our customers 
some of these techniques included chart audits for all psn physicians  increasing our focus on certain elements of our partners in quality program  implementing an outreach program for our more acutely ill customers in an effort to better manage the care for these individuals and developing a comprehensive recovery plan for customers that had serious events  such as hospitalizations or significant procedures 
the psn s medical claims expense increased by approximately million  primarily as a result of the drug costs associated with the part d benefit implemented in medical center costs include the salaries  taxes and benefits of the psn s affiliated health professionals providing primary care services  as well as other costs associated with the operations of those practices 
approximately million of our total medical expenses in related to physician practices we own as compared to million in during  the psn incurred approximately million of medical expenses related to the implantation of certain implantable automatic defibrillators aicd 
cms has directed that the costs of certain of these procedures that meet eligibility requirements be paid by cms rather than billed to medicare advantage plans 
at december   we had estimated a recovery for aicd claims we had paid at december  of approximately million  which was recorded as a reduction of medical expenses in during  we continued to work with humana to make certain that these cases met the eligibility criteria for payment by cms 
as a result of this effort  during we collected approximately  of this amount and recorded a charge of million to medical expenses to reflect management s concern about the ultimate collectibility of this amount in light of  among other things  revised guidance by cms regarding its reimbursement policies 
at december  we estimated future recoveries of approximately  related to aicds implanted in these amounts decreased our medical expense ratio by in and increased our medical expense ratio by in on february   cms sent a notice to all medicare advantage organizations that certain formulas that had previously been provided by cms for involving in the part d risk corridor calculations were in error and needed to be corrected 
these formulas related to fixed and flexible capitated part d payment demonstration target amounts 
the hmo was not impacted by these formula errors however  the psn  through humana  provides drug coverage that includes these types of arrangements 
since this formula error impacted  we decreased our revenue by approximately million for the estimated amount that was refunded back to cms through humana 
the hmo s medical expense ratio in was as compared to in substantially all of this increase was attributed to the rapid growth of the hmo in  which  among other things  negatively impacted the medical management process and also resulted in higher than expected costs paid for medical services 
during  we determined that our process requiring customers to obtain approval before receiving certain medical procedures was not effective and resulted in excess utilization and higher than expected costs paid for medical services 
in early  we changed this process which has resulted in more appropriate care for our customers 
as a result of the increased number of customers  the hmo is renegotiating the rates paid to certain hospitals and providers of outpatient services 
we anticipate that as our customer base continues to grow  we will be able to positively impact our hmo s medical expense ratio by entering into more capitated  rather than fee for service  contracts 
total medical expenses for the hmo increased million primarily as a result of the increase in customer months during over the reported medical expense ratio is impacted by both revenue and expense 
retroactive adjustments of prior period premiums that are recorded in the current period impact the mer of that period 
if the retroactive adjustment increases revenue of the period then the impact reduces the recorded mer 
conversely  if the retroactive adjustment reduces revenue of the period  then the mer for the period is higher 
these retroactive adjustments include  among other things  the mid year and annual risk score premium adjustments and settlement of part d program premiums 
in addition  actual medical claims expense usually develops differently than estimated during the period 
therefore  the estimated actual mer shown in the above table will likely change as additional claims development occurs 
favorable claims development is a result of actual medical claim cost for prior periods developing lower than the original estimated cost which reduces the reported medical expense and the mer for the current period 
unfavorable claims development is a result of actual medical claim cost for prior periods exceeding the original estimated cost which increases total reported medical expense and the mer for the current period 
for the psn  a change in either revenue or medical claims expense of approximately million impacts the psn s mer by in and a change of million impacts the psn s mer by in a change of approximately  in in either revenue or medical claims expense impacts the mer for the hmo by 
in  a change in either revenue or medical claims expense of approximately  impacts the hmo s mer by 
the estimated medical expense payable for the psn at december  was determined to be between million and million and  as is our policy  we recorded an accrual of million
