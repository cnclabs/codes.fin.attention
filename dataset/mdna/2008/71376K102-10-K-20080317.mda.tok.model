item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s annual operating performance is subject to various risks and uncertainties 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  included elsewhere herein  as well as the risk factors described in item a of this form k 
the company s future operating results may be affected by various trends and factors  which are beyond the company s control 
these include  among other factors  general business and economic conditions  rapid technological changes accompanied by frequent new product introductions  competitive pressures  dependence on key customers  inability to gauge order flows from customers  fluctuations in quarterly and annual results  the reliance on a limited number of third party suppliers  limitations of the company s manufacturing capacity and arrangements  the protection of the company s proprietary technology  the dependence on key personnel  changes in critical accounting estimates  potential impairments related to goodwill and investments  foreign regulations and potential material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting 
in addition  during weak and uncertain economic periods  customer visibility deteriorates causing delays in the placement of orders 
these factors often result in a substantial portion of the company s revenue being derived from orders placed within a quarter and shipped in the final month of the same quarter 
matters discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and elsewhere in this form k  include forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are subject to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions in preparing the financial statements in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  estimates and assumptions are required to be made that have an impact on the assets  liabilities  revenue and expense amounts reported 
these estimates can also affect supplemental information disclosures  including information about contingencies  risk and financial condition 
the company believes that given the current facts and circumstances  these estimates and assumptions are reasonable  adhere to gaap  and are consistently applied 
inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates  and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise 
management s judgment in making these estimates and relying on these assumptions may materially impact amounts reported for any period 
the critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates that we believe have the most significant effect on our financial statements are set forth below revenue recognition software development costs valuation of inventories income taxes product warranty carrying value of goodwill stock based compensation restructuring costs investments revenue recognition revenue is recognized from product sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
product sales represent the majority of our revenue and include both hardware products and hardware products with embedded software 
revenue is recognized from these product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been provided  the sale price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
additionally  products are sold on terms which transfer title and risk of loss at a specified location  typically the shipping point 
accordingly  revenue recognition from product sales occurs when all factors are met  including transfer of title and risk of loss  which typically occurs upon shipment 
if these conditions are not met  revenue recognition is deferred until such time as these conditions have been satisfied 
revenue earned from arrangements for software is accounted for under the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition 
for the sale of multiple element arrangements whereby equipment is combined with other elements  such as software and maintenance  the company allocates to  and recognizes revenue from  the various elements based on their fair value 
revenue from software requiring significant production  modification  or customization is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
anticipated losses on contracts  if any  are charged to operations as soon as such losses are determined 
if all conditions of revenue recognition are not met  revenue recognition is deferred and revenue will be recognized when all obligations under the arrangement are fulfilled 
revenue from software maintenance contracts is recognized ratably over the contractual period 
revenue from consulting and other services is recognized at the time the services are rendered 
certain products are sold through distributors who are granted limited rights of return 
potential returns are accounted for at the time of sale 
the accounting estimate related to revenue recognition is considered a critical accounting estimate because terms of sale can vary  and judgment is exercised in determining whether to defer revenue recognition 
such judgments may materially affect net sales for any period 
judgment is exercised within the parameters of gaap in determining when contractual obligations are met  title and risk of loss are transferred  sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
software development costs all software development costs incurred in establishing the technological feasibility of computer software products to be sold are charged to expense as research and development costs 
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility of a computer software product to be sold and prior to general release of that product are capitalized 
amounts capitalized are amortized commencing after general release of that product over the estimated remaining economic life of that product  generally three years  or using the ratio of current revenues to current and anticipated revenues from such product  whichever provides greater amortization 
if the technological feasibility for a particular project is judged not to have been met or recoverability of amounts capitalized is in doubt  project costs are expensed as research and development or charged to cost of goods sold  as applicable 
the accounting estimate related to software development costs is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in determining whether project costs are expensed as research and development or capitalized as an asset 
such judgments may materially affect expense amounts for any period 
judgment is exercised within the parameters of gaap in determining when technological feasibility has been met and recoverability of software development costs is reasonably assured 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
inventory includes purchased parts and components  work in process and finished goods 
provisions for excess  obsolete or slow moving inventory are recorded after periodic evaluation of historical sales  current economic trends  forecasted sales  estimated product lifecycles and estimated inventory levels 
purchasing practices  electronic component obsolescence  accuracy of sales and production forecasts  introduction of new products  product lifecycles  product support and foreign regulations governing hazardous materials are the factors that contribute to inventory valuation risks 
exposure to inventory valuation risks is managed by maintaining safety stocks  minimum purchase lots  managing product end of life issues brought on by aging components or new product introductions  and by utilizing certain inventory minimization strategies such as vendor managed inventories 
the accounting estimate related to valuation of inventories is considered a critical accounting estimate because it is susceptible to changes from period to period due to the requirement for management to make estimates relative to each of the underlying factors  ranging from purchasing  to sales  to production  to after sale support 
if actual demand  market conditions or product lifecycles differ from estimates  inventory adjustments to lower market values would result in a reduction to the carrying value of inventory  an increase in inventory write offs and a decrease to gross margins 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accordingly  the company provides deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets in amounts for which realization is not considered more likely than not to occur 
the accounting estimate related to income taxes is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in estimating future taxable income  including prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and in assessing the need for any valuation allowance 
if it should be determined that all or part of a net deferred tax asset is not able to be realized in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  in the event that it should be determined that all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future is in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income to be recognized in the period such determination was made 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions worldwide and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although management believes that adequate provision has been made for such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings of the company 
conversely  if these issues are resolved favorably in the future  the related provisions would be reduced  thus having a positive impact on earnings 
in addition  the calculation of the company s tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
as a result of the implementation of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  the company recognizes liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two step process prescribed within the interpretation 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires the company to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires the company to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
the company re evaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
product warranty warranty obligations are generally incurred in connection with the sale of the company s products 
the warranty period for these products is generally one year 
the costs incurred to provide for these warranty obligations are estimated and recorded as an accrued liability at the time of sale 
future warranty costs are estimated based on historical performance rates and related costs to repair given products 
the accounting estimate related to product warranty is considered a critical accounting estimate because judgment is exercised in determining future estimated warranty costs 
should actual performance rates or repair costs differ from estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
carrying value of goodwill tests for impairments of goodwill are conducted annually  at year end  or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the accounting estimate related to impairment of goodwill is considered a critical accounting estimate because these impairment tests include estimates of future cash flows that are dependent upon subjective assumptions regarding future operating results including growth rates  discount rates  capital requirements and other factors that impact the estimated fair value 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the goodwill s carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
stock based compensation the company s board of directors approves grants of stock options to employees to purchase our common stock 
under the provisions of sfas no 
revised share based payment  stock compensation expense is recorded based upon the estimated fair value of the stock option at the date of grant 
the accounting estimate related to stock based compensation is considered a critical accounting estimate because estimates are made in calculating compensation expense including expected option lives  forfeiture rates and expected volatility 
expected option lives are estimated using vesting terms and contractual lives 
expected forfeiture rates and volatility are calculated using historical information 
actual option lives and forfeiture rates may be different from estimates and may result in potential future adjustments which would impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recorded in a particular period 
restructuring costs restructuring costs consist of employee related severance costs  lease termination costs and other facility related closing expenses 
employee related severance benefits are recorded either at the time an employee is notified or  if there are extended service periods  is estimated and recorded pro rata over the period of each planned restructuring activity 
lease termination costs are calculated based upon fair value considering the remaining lease obligation amounts and estimates for sublease receipts 
the accounting estimate related to restructuring costs is considered a critical accounting estimate because estimates are made in calculating the amount of employee related severance benefits that will ultimately be paid and the amount of sublease receipts that will ultimately be received in future periods 
actual amounts paid for employee related severance benefits can vary from these estimates depending upon the number of employees actually receiving severance payments 
actual sublease receipts received may also vary from estimates 
investments as of december   we held million of investments in auction rate municipal debt securities which are backed by student loans or municipal debt securities 
the value of these investments is subject to possible market volatility for the period we hold these investments until their sale or maturity 
we recognize realized losses when declines in the fair value of our investments  below their cost basis  are judged to be other than temporary 
in determining when a decline in fair value is other than temporary  we consider various factors including market price if available  investment ratings  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee and the underlying collateral  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  the extent to which the investment is guaranteed  the financial health of the guarantor if any  and our ability and intent to hold the investment until maturity or for a sufficient period of time to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we make significant judgments in considering these factors 
if it were judged that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the investment is valued as the current fair value and a realized loss equal to the decline is reflected as an adjustment to net income 
such adjustments could materially adversely affect our operating results 
overview the company is a global supplier of integrated ip based platforms and solutions for advanced communications networks and innovative computer system architectures 
ip  short for internet protocol  is a widely adopted method under which information is encapsulated into packets and transferred over a computer network 
such computer networks can range from very short  efficient connections between elements within a single computer system  to that of two or more computer systems on different sides of the world communicating over the internet 
the company s products are primarily marketed through a direct worldwide sales force under a variety of brand names including advanced managed platforms  nexusware and segway 
these products are based on open standards and are sold as end solutions  application ready platforms  or as individual blade components for the communications marketplace 
a key differentiation of the company s products from competing products is the high level of internally developed software available with each product 
when purchasing our advanced managed platforms  customers can quickly incorporate their value add technologies into the platform while realizing distinct cost advantages  increased overall system reliability and performance  and improved time to market 
our segway product family provides our customers with unique  flexible and highly scalable signaling solutions for establishing or expanding cost effective telecommunication network architectures 
the company s business addresses one industry segment communications and it targets three vertical markets for its products telecommunications  aerospace and defense  and commercial 
of the three vertical markets served  telecommunications is the largest and represents approximately of the company s business 
the oem telecommunications equipment market served by the company depends upon carrier spending to upgrade network infrastructure to next generation equipment 
this market continued to be very challenging in as the company began the year  it was clear that the mergers in the carrier service provider space had resulted in stalled infrastructure spending while consolidation synergies were under review 
this delay in equipment demand also came during a time of significant merger activity among the equipment manufacturers which were also in the process of rationalizing product lines and looking for their own consolidation synergies 
the impact of these significant dynamics was felt across a broad section of the telecom industry supply chain  including many of our peers in the embedded systems arena 
to counteract the challenges in the oem telecommunications equipment market  in mid  management identified sales opportunities in selective areas within the communications market that it believes can drive future revenue growth and profitability 
one such area is aerospace and defense 
several us government agencies have initiatives underway to upgrade aging communications infrastructure with new communications networks over ip 
the company is pursuing incorporation of its advanced managed platforms into these new network architectures with numerous prime contractors including raytheon  lockheed martin  and general dynamics  as well as various federal government system integrators 
another such focused market opportunity is in ip based signaling solutions for traditional and emerging telecommunications service providers 
our segway product suite includes stps  ip stps  ip edge  ss over ip transport solutions  and signaling gateways 
these products enable carriers to lower operating costs through the utilization of ip networks and more flexible signaling network architectures  thereby creating competitive advantages in existing and emerging markets 
this market area is not only being driven by the cost benefits of ip based signaling networks  but also by the worldwide explosion of text messaging which is based upon signaling protocols 
currently  gross margins are higher and the sales cycles are shorter for both aerospace and defense and signaling product areas  compared to the traditional embedded telecommunications equipment market we serve 
industry overview embedded systems built on open standards comprise approximately a billion per year market 
relying on standards based development partners  such as the company  allows customers to meet the competitive pressures of time to market found in most technology businesses 
this also allows these suppliers to concentrate their efforts and expertise on their value add applications and services  which typically include software and additional hardware elements directed toward specific applications 
our oem customers are primarily equipment manufacturers in the telecommunications  data communications  aerospace and defense  and commercial markets 
our largest customer base is the oem equipment manufacturers serving the telecommunications market  and shipments to these customers declined in these customers depend upon carrier spending to upgrade network infrastructure to next generation equipment 
our oem telecommunications customers experienced lower sales to their customers in please refer to part  item  under the caption business  for further discussion of the industry  markets and economic environment 
strategy the company s product strategy is to deliver robust  ip based platforms and solutions to the communications marketplace 
today  the company s line of advanced managed platforms specifically addresses equipment manufacturers requirements for an increased level of system integration and services from suppliers  thus allowing them to focus on their value added stages of product development  which in most cases is application software 
this strategy provides a viable alternative to proprietary or legacy platforms and offers a contemporary platform replacement product of equal or greater capacity 
in addition  our segway signaling products  which are built on our advanced managed platforms  enable carriers and service providers to lower operating costs through the utilization of ip networks  thereby creating competitive advantages in existing and emerging markets 
management is proceeding with multi faceted initiatives to construct a solid foundation for long term growth 
these efforts are directed at end market segments within the communications market which are experiencing growth and include aerospace and defense and signaling 
these initiatives include the ongoing enhancement of our embedded systems products through tightly integrated hardware and software  and continued investment in the company s signaling systems products to further maximize the return on the company s considerable ip packet and carrier grade linux core technologies 
there are identifiable risks associated with the company s strategy in the current economic climate 
while aerospace and defense and signaling are growing markets  the oem telecommunications market is not experiencing growth 
in order to improve profitability in this environment  the company s sales and product development efforts will have to be more innovative and aggressive than those of our competitors 
management believes that based on its analysis of the marketplace and the strength of the company s product and technology portfolio  the identified risks are manageable 
if successful  management believes its initiatives can yield improved profitability  particularly if the business cycle starts to show improvement 
please refer to part  item  under the caption business  for further information regarding the company s strategy 
key performance indicators the company believes that a key indicator for its business is the volume of orders received from customers 
many oem customers for our embedded systems products are only placing orders for product when they have orders in hand from their customers 
at the current time  the company s forward looking visibility of customer orders is very limited 
this lack of customer visibility makes it challenging to forecast revenue and generally results in a substantial portion of the company s revenue being derived from orders placed within a quarter and shipped in the final month of the same quarter 
total shipments to customers in amounted to million  compared to million in this decrease in revenue was attributable to lower shipments into the oem telecommunications market  primarily due to the reduced demand from the company s two largest customers  data connection limited and alcatel lucent 
due to a decrease in demand from their customers  shipments to data connections limited and alcatel lucent declined in by million  resulting in a combined shipment level for the year to these two customers of million 
our overall decrease in shipments to the oem telecommunications market was partially offset by increased shipments to the aerospace and defense  and signaling markets 
the company works closely with oem suppliers to incorporate its ip based platforms and solutions into their new product designs 
historically  design wins have been a useful metric for the company to judge product acceptance in the marketplace because once the company s products have been designed into the oem s new product  the company could expect shipments to that oem for multiple years once the oem s product reached successful production 
the company s current oem sales efforts have been broadened to encompass aerospace and defense programs 
the aerospace and defense market is primarily government communications network projects typically with fixed durations of less than eighteen months 
the company has also increased its focus on selling its segway signaling products directly to carriers and service providers 
sales to carriers and service providers are typically single or multiple unit sales  rather than designed in sales with multi year run rates 
therefore  the company has concluded that the design win metric is no longer a meaningful metric for judging its overall product acceptance in the marketplace 
financial overview revenue revenue for amounted to million  compared to million in the decrease in revenue was attributable to lower shipments into the oem telecommunications market  primarily to the company s two largest customers  data connection ltd 
and alcatel lucent 
combined shipments to data connection and alcatel lucent after giving effect to the merger of alcatel and lucent technologies declined in by million  resulting in a combined shipment level for the year to these two customers of million 
lower shipments to these two customers were primarily attributable to weaker demand in these two customers end markets

acquisitions  equity investments and notes receivable allworx corp 
allworx formerly known as inscitek microsystems  inc in  the company invested million in allworx in the form of a convertible note receivable including funding of 
million in january 
in the fourth quarter  the company recorded a valuation charge related to this note receivable in the amount of million as collection of this note was doubtful 
the note bore interest at annually and was convertible into shares of common stock of allworx 
during the third quarter  allworx received an investment from an outside party through the sale of preferred stock 
in connection with that investment  the company and allworx renegotiated the terms of the note and all unpaid interest due to the company at the date of the new investment  amounting to 
million  was paid in the form of series a preferred stock of allworx 
in december  the company and allworx entered into an agreement whereby allworx redeemed million of the million note receivable from the company in exchange for 
million of cash and an ip license valued at 
million 
as a part of the agreement  allworx was also granted the option to redeem the remaining million of the note by june   in exchange for 
million 
as of december   allworx had not raised sufficient outside capital to assure its future as a going concern and the company recorded a valuation charge of 
million against its series a preferred stock investment in allworx  which reduced the carrying value of the investment to zero 
other than interest income  these transactions were recorded in note receivable recoveries and valuation charge on the consolidated statement of income in in may  allworx paid the company 
million to exercise their option to redeem the remaining million of the note 
the interest component of this payment was recorded in other income in the amount of 
million and the remainder was recorded in note receivable recoveries and valuation charge in the amount of 
million 
in october  allworx was acquired by a third party 
as part of this transaction  the company sold its series a preferred stock investment and recorded a gain on sale of investment in the amount of 
million 
the company received the proceeds from the sale subsequent to december restructuring activities restructuring charges in principally relate to charges for the change in estimated future cash flows from sub leasing the former san luis obispo engineering center and an agreement at year end to buy out the remaining lease term for this facility  for which the future lease payments were previously accrued in the consideration for the early termination of this lease amounted to 
million  which was paid in january restructuring charges in primarily related to the closing of the company s norwood  massachusetts engineering center  relocation of the company s san luis obispo engineering center to less expensive office space and severance costs related to reductions in force 
the relocation of the san luis obispo facility resulted in a charge for estimated lease termination costs amounting to  all actions under these programs were completed as of december   with the exception of the san luis obispo lease obligation 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  certain consolidated financial data expressed as a percentage of sales  which has been included as an aid to understanding the company s results and should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report

many of the company s segway signaling products  which are built on our advanced managed platforms  provide a full suite of signaling solutions that seamlessly bridge between circuit switched networks and the growing ip based networks 
voice products enable voice  data and fax processing for communications applications 
revenue from communications products amounted to million and million in and  respectively 
this decrease in revenue of million  or  resulted from decreases in sales of network access and voice products which were nearly offset by increases in segway signaling product sales 
computing products computing products include advanced managed platforms  a range of single board compute elements and associated chassis management products 
computing products revenue totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in revenue of million  or  was primarily attributable to a decrease in shipments to data connection  which declined by million  and a million decrease in shipments to one other customer 
lower shipments to these customers was primarily attributable to weaker demand in these customers end markets 
switching products the company s ethernet switch elements operate as the nexus of the ip packet switching functionality for advanced managed platforms and competing platforms 
switch revenue totaled million and million in and  respectively 
this decrease of million  or  is primarily attributable to decreased sales to one customer  alcatel lucent  of million  whose customer demand decreased

million of interest income 
in the fourth quarter  allworx was acquired by a third party 
in connection with the acquisition  the company received 
million as consideration for its series a preferred stock investment 
as the value of this investment had been reduced to zero in  this entire amount was recorded as gain on sale of investment in assessment of fair value of goodwill 
the company annually assesses the fair value of its intangible assets  including goodwill  to determine whether such assets may be impaired 
in so doing  the company considers many factors  including its stock price and market capitalization  future business plans and projected earnings and cash flows 
at december   management has determined that the carrying value of goodwill is not impaired 
other income  net 
other income consists primarily of interest income and totaled million in  compared to million in the company s funds are primarily invested in aaa rated  guaranteed auction rate municipal securities 
the increase in interest was partially attributable to a shift from tax free to taxable investments in the first quarter  resulting in higher average interest rates on the company s investment portfolio 
interest income of 
million and 
million was recorded related to the note receivable from allworx in and  respectively 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate is a combination of federal  state and foreign tax rates and is generally lower than statutory rates because it includes benefits derived from tax credits related to research and development activities in the united states and canada and tax exempt interest

the decline was due to funding of the stock repurchase program and management s decision to lower the company s investment exposure and increase cash equivalents

certain of these auction rate municipal securities are guaranteed by commercial insurance carriers 
as of december   the company held million in aaa rated auction rate municipal securities 
during  the company has successfully liquidated million of these investments 
therefore  as of march   the company held one aaa rated auction rate municipal security amounting to million 
the current overall credit concerns in capital markets may impact the company s ability to liquidate this security 
auction rate municipal securities provide liquidity via an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals  usually every days 
if the auctions for such securities should fail  the investments may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful 
the auction rate municipal security held at both december  and march  was involved in a successful auction in january  but at the next auction in february  the auction failed 
as such  the company was not able to sell this security 
the security  which was acquired in december  has a face value and carrying value of  and a maturity date of may   and carries a guarantee of the federal family education loan program ffelp and also carries mbia bond credit insurance 
at the time the auction failed  the interest rate was increased to the maximum contract rate of through may   at which time the contract rate will adjust to a rate equal to of the jj kenny intermediate index 
it is unknown when the company will be able to liquidate this investment or to what extent its value may now be impaired due to the auction failure and there is no assurance that auctions on this security will succeed in the future 
as of december   the carrying value of our investments was equal to the fair value based on successful auctions both preceding and subsequent to year end 
because the auction for this security failed subsequent to december   no impairment has been recorded in the accompanying statement of income for based on the company s ability to access cash and other short term investments  expected future operating cash flows  and other sources of cash  the company does not anticipate the current lack of liquidity on this investment to affect the ability to operate the company s business as usual 
the company has the ability and intent to hold this investment until it can be sold in an orderly fashion so as to minimize any potential loss in value 
because of the uncertainty of timing as to when the company may be able to do so  this investment has been classified as non current in the accompanying december  balance sheet 
off balance sheet arrangements the company had no off balance sheet arrangements during contractual obligations the company leases facilities under operating leases 
under the terms of the facility lease in rochester  new york  which expires in march  the company pays annual rent which amounts to  with pre established adjustments each year 
the company leases a facility in san luis obispo  california under a two year lease which expires in august this lease contains options for two year renewal periods

million in connection with that termination subsequent to december  the company leases office space in kanata  ontario  canada 
the term of this lease extends through october rent payments under this lease amount to  annually  with annual inflationary adjustments 
the company leases office space near london  england 
the terms of this lease extend through march and require quarterly lease payments which amount to  annually 
for the lease agreements described above  the company is also required to pay the pro rata share of the real property taxes and assessments  expenses and other charges associated with these facilities 
the company leases facilities in its other operating locations in north america that expire through the company enters into purchase commitments during the normal course of its operations

due to uncertainties regarding whether  and when  the company s tax returns may be examined by the applicable taxing authorities  and the uncertain possible outcomes of such examinations  if any  an estimate of the timing of payments related to uncertain tax positions and related interest cannot be made 
see note n  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s uncertain tax positions 
current position assuming there is no significant change in the business  management believes that the company s current cash  cash equivalents and investments  together with cash generated from operations should be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements  including working capital and capital expenditure requirements  for at least the next twelve months 
however  management is continuing to evaluate strategic acquisitions to accelerate the company s growth and market penetration efforts 
these strategic acquisition efforts could have an impact on our working capital  liquidity or capital resources 
the company does not expect that the potential lack of liquidity of its auction rate municipal investments will materially affect the ability to operate the company s business as usual 
the company intends to renew its line of credit upon its expiration in december  assuming the ability to do so

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to various market risks in the normal course of business  primarily interest rate risk and changes in the market value of its investments 
the company believes its exposure to such risk is minimal 
the company s investments are made in accordance with the company s investment policy and consist of aaa rated auction rate municipal securities 
the company is also subject to foreign exchange risk related to its operations in ottawa  canada 
the company believes that its exposure to foreign currency risk is minimal  as generally all revenues and accounts receivable are denominated in us dollars 
the company does not participate in the investment of derivative financial instruments 
we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million at december  the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
some of the securities in which we invest  however  may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including auction rate municipal securities  commercial paper  money market funds  debt securities and certificates of deposit 
as of december   all of our cash equivalents were held in money market accounts or bank deposits and our short term investments were comprised of auction rate municipal securities 
as of march   we held million in one auction rate municipal security 
the underlying assets of this security are student loans which are partially backed by the federal government under the federal family education loan program 
this security was involved in a successful auction in january  but at the next auction in february  the auction failed 
there is no assurance that auctions on this security will succeed in the future 
as a result  our ability to liquidate this investment without loss in the near term may be limited  and our ability to fully recover the carrying value of this investment may be limited or non existent 
if the issuer is unable to successfully close future auctions or its credit rating or the credit rating of its guarantor deteriorates  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on this investment 
we believe we will be able to liquidate our investments without significant loss but our ability to successfully do so  as well as the timing of such an outcome  is uncertain 
we currently believe that the value of this security is not significantly impaired  primarily due to the collateral backing of the underlying securities  the bond credit insurance it carries and its partial government guaranty 
however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investment s recorded value 
based on our expected operating cash flows  our other cash and investment balances  and our other potential sources of cash  including our available line of credit  we do not anticipate that the potential lack of liquidity on this investment in the near term will affect our ability to carry on our business as usual
