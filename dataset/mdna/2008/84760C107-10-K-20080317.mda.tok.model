item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate overview we develop  manufacture  market and distribute single use medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures within the cardiovascular system for use with our proprietary excimer laser system 
excimer laser technology delivers relatively cool ultraviolet energy to ablate or remove arterial blockages including plaque  calcium and thrombus 
our laser system includes the cvx laser unit and various disposable fiber optic laser catheters 
our laser catheters contain hundreds of small diameter  flexible optical fibers that can access difficult to reach peripheral and coronary anatomy and produce evenly distributed laser energy at the tip of the catheter for more uniform ablation 
we believe that our excimer laser system is the only laser system approved in the united states  europe  japan and canada for use in multiple  minimally invasive cardiovascular procedures 
these procedures include atherectomy  which is a procedure to remove arterial blockages in the peripheral and coronary vasculature  and the removal of infected  defective or abandoned cardiac lead wires from patients with pacemakers or icds  which are electronic devices that regulate the heartbeat 
as of december   our worldwide installed base of laser systems was  of which were in the united states 
we are focused on increasing recurring revenue  which includes disposable catheter sales  service and laser rental  which in the aggregate represented of our revenue for disposable catheter sales represented of our revenue for income before income taxes was  for the year ended december   compared with a loss before income taxes of  for the year ended december  an increase in revenue due to increased sales of both our vascular intervention products which include our laser based atherectomy products and our support catheters that are not laser based products as well as our lead management products was partially offset by increased operating expenses related to the overall growth of our business 
revenue by product line in thousands disposable products service and other revenue laser equipment total revenue other revenue consists primarily of sales to elana bv see strategic alliances  offset by a provision for sales returns 

table of contents financial results by geographical segment in thousands revenue united states europe total revenue in thousands net income loss united states europe total net income loss year ended december  compared with year ended december  revenue during the year ended december  was  an increase of compared with  during the year ended december   as a result of increased revenue in all revenue categories  but driven primarily by growth in disposable products revenue 
disposable products revenue was  for the year ended december   which was higher than disposable products revenue of  during the same period in we separate our disposable products revenue into two separate categories vascular intervention which includes our atherectomy and support catheter products and lead removal 
for the year ended december   our vascular intervention revenue totaled  of disposable products revenue and our lead removal revenue totaled  of our disposable products revenue 
vascular intervention revenue  which includes products used in both the coronary and peripheral vascular system  grew and was the main driver of disposable product revenue growth in compared with vascular intervention revenue growth was primarily due to unit volume increases from the continued penetration of our turbo elite product line  and  to a lesser extent to unit volume increases in our quick cross support catheter 
approximately of the vascular intervention revenue growth compared with the prior year was due to unit price increases related to our turbo elite product line  the launch of which was completed in the second quarter of atherectomy revenue growth from current levels will depend on our ability to increase market acceptance of the turbo elite product line and our ability to continue to increase the worldwide installed base of lasers  as well as the future success of our ongoing clinical research and product development within the coronary and peripheral atherectomy markets 
lead removal revenue grew during compared with we continue to believe our lead removal revenue is increasing primarily as a result of the increase in use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators icd  devices that regulate heart rhythm 
recent clinical studies multicenter automatic defibrillator implantation trial ii  or madit ii  the sudden cardiac death in heart failure trial  or scdheft  and the cardiac resynchronization therapy with and without implantable defibrillator in advanced chronic heart failure trial  or companion have shown positive results expanding the patient population that may benefit from defibrillator implants 
the results of the madit clinical trial became available in  the scd heft clinical trial results were made public in march  and the companion results were published in may growth in the icd including cardiac resynchronization defiibrillators or crt ds market continue to be fueled by these and other trials  depending on the establishment of referral patterns to electrophysiologists for this expanded patient pool and maintenance of appropriate reimbursement  although there can be no assurance that this will occur 
generally  growth in the implantable defibrillator market contributes to growth in our lead removal business 
although we expect our lead removal business to continue to grow  there can be no assurances to that effect 
while removal of infected pacing and defibrillation leads is widely accepted  the predominant practice in this market is to cap non functional leads and leave them in the body rather than to remove them 
when an icd or crt d device is implanted  it often replaces a pacemaker 
in these cases  the old ventricular pacing lead may be removed to minimize the potential for venous obstruction when the new icd leads and any additional pacing leads are implanted 
we believe along with many top physicians that removal of non functional leads in many cases  especially in relatively younger patients  serves to avoid future complicating scenarios that may occur over the course of the patient s life with their implanted leads 
additionally  a large manufacturer of pacemakers and defibrillators and the related leads announced a recall of  leads in the united states marketed under the fidelis brand  due to a failure rate of these leads that was higher than that of other similar leads 
although physicians are not recommending the removal of all these fidelis leads  we expect a portion of these leads to be removed 
we have initiated programs to educate clinicians on the management of lead complications  but there are no assurances that these programs will be successful or will change the current standard of care 

table of contents laser equipment revenue in was  compared with  in  which represents an increase of 
as of december  our worldwide installed base of laser systems was in the united states compared with in the united states as of december  this represents new laser placements in of laser systems net of returns compared to new laser systems placed during data as to our installed base of laser systems and new laser placements includes outright sales  rentals and lasers being evaluated during a trial period by potential purchasers 
laser sales revenue  which is included in laser equipment revenue  decreased to  for as compared to  for the decrease was due to the sale of five fewer units in compared to in  partially offset by an increase in average sale prices from  in to  in for the units sold due to a higher mix of sales from inventory as compared to rental evaluation conversions 
rental revenue increased from  in to  in  due mainly to an increase in systems placed with customers under our various rental programs  particularly our cap free program  which was introduced in the second quarter of most of our laser system placements during and related to systems placed under our cap free and evergreen rental program  as opposed to outright sales  and we expect in that most of our new laser placements will continue to be under our cap free and other rental programs 
we believe that laser system placements is a more relevant metric for measuring our progress within the equipment business  as it represents new customers that have elected to acquire a laser system  whether it be from an outright sale from inventory  or a rental program 
a laser system placement represents an opportunity to sell our higher margin disposable products 
service and other revenue of  during increased from  for service and other revenue is generated through the repair and maintenance services offered to our customers and is associated exclusively with our laser systems 
the growth in service and other revenue is a result of an increase in our installed base 
gross margin increased to as a percentage of revenue during the year ended december  as compared with during the year ended december  this increase was mainly due to an increase in unit prices related to our turbo elite product line due to the full year effect of a price increase instituted in and an improvement in the mix of our revenue  with a higher percentage increase in higher margin disposable products than the percentage increase in lower margin laser equipment revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  as compared with  in the increase is primarily due to the following selling expenses increased approximately  due to the following factors approximately  relates to personnel related expenses associated with the hiring of additional employees in within our sales and marketing organizations 
these increased costs include salaries and benefits  recruiting and travel costs 
an additional  of the increase relates to higher commissions expense as a result of our increased revenue compared with the prior year 
increased expenses associated with the operations of spectranetics international  bv  our wholly owned subsidiary in the netherlands that serves the european market  represented approximately  of the increase

additional convention  meeting and education costs  primarily the result of attendance at an increasing number of tradeshows and conventions  combined with additional physician training costs incurred primarily in peer to peer clinical training sessions  accounted for approximately  of the increase 
the remainder of the increase relates to increased materials and supplies costs consumed by our various sales and marketing departments as well as increased allocation of facilities related costs 

table of contents general and administrative expenses increased approximately  as a result of increased personnel related costs of approximately  associated with increased staffing 
increased facilities related and depreciation costs of  due to the relocation of our g a departments to a leased facility in north colorado springs 
increased bad debts expense of  which is consistent with the increase in total accounts receivable 
the above increases were partially offset by the following decreases in g a expense compared to the prior year decreased costs of approximately  as compared with related to accrued company wide incentive compensation based on financial performance in relation to established targets 
decreased legal fees of approximately  primarily due to a reduction in the amount of legal expense associated with the rentrop lawsuit

additionally  other outside consulting fees decreased by approximately  research  development and other technology expenses include royalty expenses  research and development expenses  and clinical study expenses 
research  development and other technology expenses of  for the year ended december  increased from  for the year ended december  the following items contributed to increases in research  development and other technology expenses for as compared to increased personnel related costs of approximately  due to the hiring of additional engineering staff for the development of new products for our technology 
increased facilities related costs of  due to the relocation of our r d departments to a leased facility in north colorado springs 
increased outside services expense of approximately  which primarily includes increased fees paid to outside vendors assisting us with technology enhancements to our laser system 
increased amortization expense of approximately  related primarily to the purchase of an electronic document control program and two new patents 
the above increases were partially offset by the following decreases in r d expense compared to the prior year decreased royalties expense of approximately  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a  charge related to the tentative verdict in the rentrop case as royalty expense 
we have made additional royalty accruals in related to the rentrop matter on subsequent sales  but the total expense recorded in is less than what was recorded in this was partially offset by increased royalties related to certain licensed technology as a result of our higher sales 
decreased materials and other supplies costs of approximately  due to reduced prototype materials expense in interest income for was  compared with  for the increase in interest income in is mainly due to the full year effect of the invested net proceeds of the secondary stock offering we completed in the second quarter of our investment securities portfolio consists primarily of government or government agency securities with maturities less than two years 

table of contents for the year ended december   we recorded a net income tax benefit of  compared to income tax expense of  for the prior year 
included in the net tax benefit for is a non cash tax benefit of  related to a reduction in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
this adjustment was made in the second quarter of as a result of our quarterly assessment of our deferred tax asset as required by sfas  and the reasons for the adjustment are discussed in more detail in note  income taxes  to our accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in addition to the valuation allowance adjustment  for the year ended december   we recorded an income tax provision of  against out pretax income for the year 
a portion of the company s granted stock options qualify as incentive stock options iso for income tax purposes 
as such  a tax benefit is not recorded at the time the compensation cost related to the options is recorded for book purposes due to the fact that an iso does not ordinarily result in a tax benefit unless there is a disqualifying disposition 
due to the treatment of incentive stock options for tax purposes our effective tax rate is subject to variability 
net income for the year ended december  was  or per diluted share  compared with a net loss of  or per diluted share during the year ended december  net income for includes the  deferred tax asset valuation allowance adjustment noted above

for the year ended december   our atherectomy revenue totaled  of disposable products revenue and our lead removal revenue totaled  of our disposable products revenue 
atherectomy revenue  which includes products used in both the coronary and peripheral vascular system  grew and was the main driver of disposable product revenue growth in compared with atherectomy revenue growth was primarily due to unit volume increases from the continued penetration of our clirpath product line since its launch in may  following the april fda clearance to market these products to treat total occlusions in the legs that are not crossable with a guidewire 
approximately of the atherectomy revenue growth compared with the prior year was due to unit price increases related to our clirpath turbo product line  the launch of which was completed in the second quarter of additionally  our quick cross support catheters contributed to the atherectomy revenue growth  accounting for of the growth 
atherectomy revenue growth from current levels will depend on our ability to increase market acceptance of the clirpath product line and our ability to continue to increase the worldwide installed base of lasers  as well as the future success of our ongoing clinical research and product development within the coronary and peripheral atherectomy markets

liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and current and long term investment securities of  a decrease of  from  at december  the decrease was primarily due to capital expenditures made in support of increased manufacturing capacity  including related facilities costs 
we consider the total of cash  cash equivalents and investment securities to be available for operating activities since the cash equivalents and investment securities can be readily converted to cash 
cash and cash equivalents were  at december  compared with  at december   an increase of  the increase was due to a decision to keep a larger portion of our investment portfolio in cash equivalent money market accounts

below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and their impact on the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those relating to product returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  royalty obligations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments and estimates form the basis for the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not objectively available from other sources 
carrying values of these assets and liabilities may differ under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of our disposable products is recognized when products are shipped and title transfers to the customer 
revenue from the sale of excimer laser systems is recognized after completion of contractual obligations  which generally include delivery and installation of the system 
our team of field service engineers are responsible for installation of each laser and  in some cases  participation in the training program at each site 
we generally provide a one year warranty on laser sales  which includes parts  labor and replacement gas 
upon expiration of the warranty period  we offer similar service to our customers under service contracts or on a fee for service basis 
revenue from warranty service and service contracts is initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized over the related service contract period  which is generally one year 
revenue from fee for service arrangements is recognized upon completion of the related service 
we offer three laser system placement programs  which are described below  in addition to the sale of laser systems cap free rental program under this program  we retain title to the laser system and the customer agrees to a catheter price list that includes a per unit surcharge 
customers are expected  but not required  to make minimum purchases of catheters at regular intervals  and we reserve the right to have the unit returned should the minimum purchases not be made 
we recognize the total surcharge as revenue each month  believing it to be the best measurement of revenue associated with the customers use of the laser unit each month 
the laser unit is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment  and the depreciation expense related to the system is included in cost of revenue based upon a three to five year expected life of the unit  depending on whether it is a remanufactured unit or a new laser unit 
costs to maintain the equipment are expensed as incurred 
evergreen rental program rental revenue under this program varies on a sliding scale depending on the customer s catheter purchases each month 
rental revenue is invoiced on a monthly basis and revenue is recognized upon invoicing 
the laser unit is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment  and depreciation expense is recorded within cost of revenue based upon a three to five year expected life of the unit  depending on whether it is a remanufactured unit or a new laser unit 
costs to maintain the equipment are expensed as incurred 
we also offer a straight monthly rental program  and there are a small number of hospitals that pay rent of  to  per month under this program 

table of contents evaluation programs the company loans laser systems to institutions for use over a short period of time  usually three to six months 
the loan of the equipment is to create awareness of our products and their capabilities  and no revenue is earned or recognized in connection with the placement of a loaned laser  although sales of disposable products result from the laser placement 
the laser unit is transferred to the equipment held for rental or loan account upon shipment and depreciation expense is recorded within selling  general and administrative expense based upon a three to five year expected life of the unit  depending on whether it is a remanufactured unit or a new laser unit 
costs to maintain the equipment are expensed as incurred 
we adopted emerging issues task force bulletin eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  on july  the primary impact of the adoption of eitf was to treat service provided during the one year warranty period as a separate unit of accounting 
as such  the fair value of this service is deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the related warranty period 
revenue allocated to the laser element is recognized upon completion of contractual obligations in the sales contract  which generally includes delivery and installation of the laser system 
prior to july   revenue for the sale of laser equipment and the one year warranty was recognized upon shipment of the laser 
deferred revenue associated with service to be performed during the warranty period totaled  and  as of december  and  respectively 
allowance for sales returns 
we estimate product sales returns based on historical experience 
the provision for sales returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue based on our estimates 
actual sales returns may vary depending on customer inventory levels  new product introductions and other factors 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  these facts are subject to change 
royalty liability 
we license certain patents from various licensors pursuant to license agreements 
royalty expense is calculated pursuant to the terms of the license agreements and is included in research  development and other technology in the accompanying financial statements 
we have established liabilities for royalty payment obligations based on these calculations  which involve management estimates that require judgment 
although we believe the estimates to be reasonable based on facts in existence at the time of estimation  the estimates are subject to change based on changes in the underlying facts and assumptions used to develop these estimates 
we have recorded a loss contingency within our accrued royalty liability of approximately  related primarily to patent litigation with dr 
peter rentrop which is discussed in further detail in note  commitments and contingencies  to our consolidated financial statements based on amounts awarded to dr 
rentrop by a jury in a trial concluded in december we have commenced proceedings to appeal this jury verdict 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in their consolidated financial statements 
sfas r focuses primarily on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in share based payment transactions 
sfas r does not change the accounting guidance for share based payment transactions with parties other than employees provided in sfas in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to sfas r 
the company has applied the provisions of sab in its adoption of sfas r to its valuation methods 
the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires recognition of expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards outstanding as of the date of adoption 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the date of adoption have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
the company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes options pricing model 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for year ended december  was  which consisted of compensation expense related to employee stock options based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period  and the estimated value to be realized by employees related to shares expected to be issued under the company s employee stock purchase plan

currently  we do not hedge these interest rate exposures
