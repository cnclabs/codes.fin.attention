item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information about the results of operations  financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources of east west bancorp  inc and its subsidiaries 
this information is intended to facilitate the understanding and assessment of significant changes and trends related to our financial condition and the results of our operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the banking industry 
the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  financial information that is based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
all of our significant accounting policies are described in note of our consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report and are essential to understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in addition  certain accounting policies require significant judgment in applying complex accounting principles to individual transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment 
we have established procedures and processes to facilitate making the judgments necessary to prepare financial statements 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental and complex accounting estimates and principles 
in each area  we have identified the variables most important in the estimation process 
we have used the best information available to make the estimations necessary to value the related assets and liabilities 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key variables could change future valuations and impact net income 
investment securities the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in note of the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise  whereas for available for sale securities  they are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized 
the fair values of the investment securities are generally determined by reference to the average of at least two quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities 
in obtaining such valuation information from third parties  the company has evaluated the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values 
for those securities for which the company is unable to obtain more than one outside quoted market price  the company evaluates the broker s valuation methodology for reasonableness and obtains an independent validation of the market price received from another broker who has experience with such investments 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
such impairment must be recognized in current earnings rather than in other comprehensive income 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process  requiring the use of judgments and assumptions 
we examine all individual securities that are in an unrealized loss position at each reporting date for other than temporary impairment 
specific investment related factors we examine to assess impairment include the nature of the investment  severity and duration of the loss  an analysis of the issuers of the securities and whether there has been any cause for default on the securities and any change in the rating of the securities by the various rating agencies 
we reexamine the financial resources  intent and the overall ability of the company to hold the securities until their fair values recover 
additionally  we evaluate whether the creditworthiness of the issuer calls the realization of contractual cash flows into question 
management does not believe that there are any investment securities  other than those identified in previous periods  which are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as of december  investment securities are discussed in more detail in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
allowance for loan losses our allowance for loan loss methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for loan loss that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience  delinquency and chargeoff trends  collateral values  changes in nonperforming loans  and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements and borrowers sensitivity to quantifiable external factors including commodity and finished good prices as well as acts of nature earthquakes  floods  fires  etc 
that occur in a particular period 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in our markets and  in particular  the state of certain industries 
size and complexity of individual credits  loan structure  extent and nature of waivers of existing loan policies  and pace of portfolio growth are other qualitative factors that are considered in our methodologies 
a detailed discussion of our allowance for loan loss methodology can be found in management s discussion and analysis of consolidated financial condition and results of operations allowance for loan losses 
as we add new products  increase the complexity of our loan portfolio  and expand our geographic coverage  we continue to enhance our methodology to keep pace with the size and complexity of the loan portfolio and changing credit environment 
changes in any of the factors cited above could have a significant impact on the loan loss calculation 
we believe that our methodologies continue to be appropriate given our size and level of complexity 
this discussion should also be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this report including the section entitled loans and allowance for loan losses 
loan sales we routinely sell and securitize single family and multifamily loans to secondary market investors 
we may retain residual and other interests  which are considered retained interests in the sold or securitized loans 
the gain on sale recorded on these loans depends  in part  on our allocation of the previous carrying amount of the loans to the retained interests 
previous carrying amounts are allocated in proportion to the relative fair values of the loans sold and the interests retained 
the fair values of retained interests are estimated based upon the present value of the associated expected future cash flows taking into consideration future prepayment rates  discount rates  expected credit losses  and other factors that impact the value of the retained interests 
when mortgage loans are sold  we generally retain the right to service these loans 
we may record mortgage servicing assets  or msa  when the benefits of servicing are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer 
mortgage servicing assets are initially recorded at fair value based on independent valuations provided by an outside third party 
the company determines whether the benefits of servicing are expected to be more than adequate compensation to a servicer by discounting all of the future net cash flows associated with the contractual rights and obligations of the servicing agreement 
the expected future net cash flows are discounted at a rate equal to the return that would adequately compensate a substitute servicer for performing the servicing 
in addition to the anticipated rate of loan prepayments and discount rates  other assumptions such as the cost to service the underlying loans  foreclosure costs  ancillary income and float rates are also used in determining the value of the msas 
mortgage servicing assets are discussed in more detail in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
goodwill impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangibles  goodwill must be allocated to reporting units and tested for impairment 
the company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances  such as adverse changes in the business  indicate that there may be justification for conducting an interim test 
impairment testing is performed at the reporting unit level which is the same level as the company s four major operating segments identified in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
the first part of the test is a comparison  at the reporting unit level  of the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  then the second part of the test is needed to measure the amount of potential goodwill impairment 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is calculated and compared to the actual carrying value of goodwill recorded within the reporting unit 
if the carrying value of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  then the company would recognize an impairment loss for the amount of the difference  which would be recorded as a charge against net income 
the fair values of the reporting units are determined primarily using discounted cash flow models based on each reporting unit s internal forecasts 
for additional information regarding goodwill  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
share based compensation we account for share based awards to employees  officers  and directors in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
we adopted sfas no 
r  as required  on january  prior to  we recognized stock based compensation expense for employee share based awards based on their intrinsic value on the date of grant pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and followed the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective approach 
under the modified prospective approach  prior periods are not restated for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled 
compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures  for awards outstanding at the effective date is recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosures under the original sfas no 
we grant nonqualified stock options and restricted stock 
most of our stock option and restricted stock awards include a service condition that relates only to vesting 
the stock option awards generally vest in one to four years from the grant date  while the restricted stock awards generally vest in three to five years from the date of grant 
compensation expense is amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award  which is generally the maximum vesting period of the award 
we use an option pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of our stock options which is affected by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these methods used to determine these variables are generally similar to the methods used prior to for the purposes of our pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
we make assumptions regarding expected term  expected volatility  expected dividend yield  and risk free interest rate in determining the fair value of our stock options 
the expected term represents the weighted average period that stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term assumption is estimated based on the stock options vesting terms and remaining contractual life and employees historical exercise behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period of time equal to the expected term of the stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s current dividend payout rate on its common stock 
for the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant appropriate for the term of the employee stock options 
for restricted share awards  the grant date fair value is measured at the fair value of the company s common stock as if the restricted share was vested and issued on the date of grant 
as share based compensation expense under sfas no 
r is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
share based compensation is discussed in more detail in notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
recent developments the us and global financial markets have experienced significant disruptions in recent months  due largely to a downturn in the housing market 
interest rates on many subprime mortgage loans have reset  causing borrowers to delay payments or default on their loans 
the significant increase in foreclosure activity and rising interest rates during the first half of depressed housing prices further as problems in the subprime markets spread to the near prime and prime mortgage markets 
the recent housing market crisis has also forced many institutions that held large amounts of financial hybrid paper to liquidate their assets and were forced to sell them at liquidation discounts 
this has created extremely unfavorable market conditions that have resulted in greater volatility  less liquidity  widening credit spreads  and has pulled back many investors from purchasing mortgage backed securities 
in response to the challenging conditions in the housing market and the broad financial services industry as well as mounting recessionary pressures in the economic environment overall  as of january   the federal reserve board has lowered the federal funds rate by a total of basis points since august through several consecutive rate cuts 
these rate cuts are intended  among other things  to stimulate activity in the deeply contracted housing market  alleviate credit pressures for businesses and households  and expand overall access to liquidity 
the federal reserve board continues to monitor deteriorating housing and economic market conditions  the tighter credit environment  and increasing concerns about a potential recession  and is prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from disruptions in the financial markets 
in light of these unprecedented challenges faced by the financial services industry  we want to reinforce that the bank does not originate or have subprime loans nor does the company hold investments backed by subprime loans in its available for sale portfolio 
due to our strict underwriting standards  we believe that our asset quality is strong and we believe that any potential future loan losses will be at manageable levels 
we have been monitoring and will continue to vigilantly monitor our loan portfolio on a loan by loan basis 
overall  we believe our loan portfolio is sound 
we further believe that the principal and interest related to our investment portfolio are collectible in the future and that we have the financial resources and the intent to hold investment securities with unrealized losses until their market values recover to cost 
overview we achieved another year of record financial performance during  representing our eleventh consecutive year of record earnings 
diluted earnings per share for the full year increased relative to representing one of the highest earnings per share growth rates among our peer banks 
despite this achievement  however  we were not immune to the challenging economic environment facing the entire financial industry 
during the fourth quarter of  diluted earnings per share decreased as compared to the same period in primarily due to an increase in loan loss provisions recorded during the period 
the million loss provision recorded during the fourth quarter of acutely reflects the adverse impact of the housing market crisis that is currently plaguing the banking and mortgage industry 
our management team is committed to lead us through this current downturn and we believe that we will continue to deliver sound financial results in during  we took advantage of several strategic opportunities to grow both domestically and internationally 
through our acquisition of desert community bank dcb  we established our presence in the inland empire region of southern california 
dcb was headquartered in victorville  california and provided community banking services through nine branches throughout the high desert area of san bernardino county 
this transaction was consummated in august  several months after the opening of our first commercial banking center in this high growth area located in ontario  california 
as of the merger closing date  dcb had total assets of million  net loans of million  and total deposits of million 
the acquisition resulted in total goodwill of million and core deposit premium of million 
all of dcb s systems have been successfully integrated into our infrastructure 
dcb continues to maintain its name and operates as a division of the bank 
we also made noteworthy strides in expanding our market presence in the greater china region 
during the first quarter of  the hong kong branch commenced operations as our first overseas full service branch offering a variety of deposit  loan and international banking products 
additionally  during august  we opened a representative office in shanghai  china 
similar to our existing representative office in beijing  the shanghai office broadens our international banking capabilities and extends our penetration into the robust greater china market 
we continue to explore other strategic opportunities to broaden our presence overseas 
during  we continued to securitize loans to enhance our liquidity  manage our capital  and reduce our overall credit risk 
we securitized a total of billion in single and multifamily loans through a private label securitization and through the federal national mortgage association fannie mae 
we recorded million in mortgage servicing assets in connection with these securitizations as the bank continues to service the underlying loans 
in accordance with applicable accounting guidance  these securitization transactions were accounted for as neither sales nor financings with no gains or losses recorded to operations 
a portion of the resulting securities that were initially retained in our available for sale investment portfolio have been subsequently sold for liquidity management purposes 
net income totaled million during  a increase from the million earned during as previously mentioned  diluted earnings per share for the full year increased to from in our return on average assets in was  compared to in and return on average equity was in  compared to in in light of the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment  management has moderated its expectations for the upcoming year 
net income per diluted common share for is anticipated to be in the range of to  or a decrease of from our guidance is based on reduced expectations on loan and deposit growth during and also factors net interest margin compression resulting from the recent actions by the federal reserve to lower interest rates 
net interest income increased to million during  compared with million during the increase in net interest income is predominantly due to the growth in volume and increased yields on loans and investment securities during these factors were partially offset by and increase in the volume of time deposits greater than or equal to  money market accounts  short term borrowings and long term borrowings  as well as higher rates paid on all categories of interest bearing liabilities 
our net interest margin decreased basis points to during  compared to during we anticipate net interest margin pressures to continue in and estimate our net margin to be in the range of to for noninterest income increased to million during from million in the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to higher net gain on sales of investment securities and loans  higher branch related fee income  higher mortgage servicing fees resulting from increased loan securitization activity  and net gain on sale of bank premises 
as a result of our continued expansion during  total noninterest expense increased to million in  compared with million in this increase is primarily driven by a increase in compensation and employee benefits  a increase in occupancy and equipment expenses  a increase in data processing expenses  and a increase in other operating expenses 
the increases in compensation  occupancy  and other operating expenses can be attributed to our recent acquisitions  as well as the addition of operational and administrative personnel and the opening of new administrative offices to accommodate our continued growth 
despite the sizable increase in overall expenses  our efficiency ratio  which represents noninterest expense excluding the amortization of intangibles and investments in affordable housing partnerships divided by the aggregate of net interest income before provision for loan losses and noninterest income  increased only marginally to during  compared to during we believe this to be a reflection of our ability to efficiently and effectively utilize our resources and operating platform to support our continuing growth 
we anticipate noninterest expenses for to increase by approximately and our efficiency ratio for the full year of to be approximately 
these estimates are derived in anticipation of the company s continuing growth as well as additional expenditures that may result from the overall economic uncertainty 
additionally  the company is committed to investing in its infrastructure in to drive long term growth 
total consolidated assets at december  increased to billion  compared with billion at december  a growth in gross loans and a growth in investment securities were the primary drivers of this increase 
excluding the impact of the dcb acquisition and loan securitizations  organic loan growth was  or billion  during we attribute overall loan growth to the continued expansion of relationships throughout california  the addition of seasoned and skilled banking professionals  and increased loan origination volume from our branch network 
due to the uncertainty surrounding the economic environment and the contraction in the housing market  we estimate loan growth in to be a modest 
total average assets increased to billion in  compared to billion in  due primarily to the growth in average loans and investment securities 
total average loans grew to billion during the growth in average loans was driven by increases in all major loan sectors  except for single family and multifamily real estate loans due to securitization activity 
total average investment securities increased to billion during primarily due to billion in single family and multifamily loan securitizations during the year 
total average deposits rose during to billion  compared to billion in with the exception of interest bearing checking deposits and time deposits less than  we experienced gains in all other deposit categories during  with the most significant contributions coming from money market accounts and time deposits greater than or equal to as a result of prevailing adverse conditions in the housing market  total nonperforming assets increased to million  or of total assets at december   compared with million  or of total assets  at december  the increase in nonperforming assets is primarily due to the addition of several residential construction loans resulting from the protracted slowdown in the housing market 
the allowance for loan losses totaled million at december   representing of outstanding total loans 
this compares with million at december   representing of outstanding total loans 
increased loan chargeoffs  higher levels of classified and nonperforming loans  and loan growth are factors that contributed to the million in loan loss provisions recorded during  as compared to the million recorded during net loan chargeoffs totaled million during  representing of average loans during this compares with thousand in net loan recoveries  or of average loans  during in response to the downturn in the housing market  our management has been vigilantly monitoring various sectors of our loan portfolio for potential weaknesses  particularly our residential construction portfolio 
we believe that our overall level of asset quality remains sound and that net chargeoffs in should remain below the company s long standing benchmark of 
however  given the uncertain economic conditions  our management also believes that our loan loss reserve level will increase during we continue to be well capitalized under all regulatory guidelines with a tier i risk based capital ratio of  a total risk based capital ratio of  and a tier i leverage ratio of at december  during  we raised million in additional regulatory capital through the issuance of trust preferred securities in two separate trust preferred offerings 
similar to previous offerings  these securities were issued through newly formed statutory business trusts  trust xiii and trust ix  wholly owned subsidiaries of the company 
trust preferred securities currently qualify as tier i capital for regulatory purposes 
the net proceeds from these trust preferred offerings were used to partially fund the acquisition of dcb and also to support the continued growth of the bank 
in recognition of the bank s consistent and solid financial performance  the board of directors authorized a increase in the quarterly cash dividends paid to shareholders 
beginning with the first quarter of  cash dividends increased to per share  compared with the per share paid in previous quarters 
additionally  the board also authorized a new stock repurchase program to buy back up to million of the company s common stock 
this dividend increase  along with the new stock repurchase program  reflect not only our commitment to return capital to our shareholders  but also our continued confidence about the future of the company 
results of operations net income for totaled million  compared with million for and million for  representing an increase of for and for on a per diluted share basis  net income was  and for  and  respectively 
the growth in net earnings during is primarily attributable to higher net interest and noninterest income  partially offset by higher provision for loan losses  higher operating expenses and a higher provision for income taxes 
during  the increase in net earnings is predominantly due to higher net interest and noninterest income and lower provision for loan losses  partially offset by higher operating expenses and a higher provision for income taxes 
our return on average total assets declined to in  compared with in and in the decrease in our return on average total assets during  relative to and  is due to the company s growth both organically and through recent acquisitions 
our return on average stockholders equity also decreased to in  compared with in and in the decrease in the return on average stockholders equity during  compared to  resulted from the issuance of additional shares of company common stock in connection with the acquisition of dcb 
table components of net income year ended december  in millions net interest income provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense provision for income taxes net income return on average total assets return on average stockholders equity net interest income our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on loans  investment securities and other earning assets less the interest expense on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income in totaled million  an increase over net interest income of million in total interest and dividend income during increased to million compared with million during this increase is attributable primarily to a growth in average earning assets  predominantly loans and investment securities 
average loans increased to billion in  from billion in  due to continued strong loan demand and decreased loan payoff activity 
average investment securities grew to billion during  compared to billion during  primarily due to the company s loan securitization activity 
higher yields on loans and investment securities further contributed to the increase in interest and dividend income 
total interest expense during increased to million compared with million a year ago 
the increase in interest expense during can be attributed to both the growth in average interest bearing liabilities  predominantly time deposits greater than or equal to  and repurchase agreements  as well as higher rates paid on all categories of interest bearing liabilities  reflecting the interest rate environment during the first three quarters of as well as sustained pricing competition in the deposit market

we also continue to rely on noninterest bearing demand deposits as a funding source  with average noninterest bearing demand deposits increasing to billion during  compared to billion in our overall cost of funds  which takes into account our portfolio of noninterest bearing demand deposits  increased basis points to during  compared to for the previous year

we are vigilantly monitoring delinquencies and proactively reviewing the credit risk exposure in various sectors of our loan portfolio to minimize and mitigate potential losses 
considering the downturn in the housing market and faced with uncertain economic conditions  we believe that our loan loss reserve level will increase during provisions for loan losses are charged to income to bring the allowance for credit losses as well as the allowance for unfunded loan commitments  off balance sheet credit exposures  and recourse provisions to a level deemed appropriate by the company based on the factors discussed under the allowance for loan losses section of this report

this compares to thousand in oreo gains recorded during branch fees  which represent revenues derived from branch operations  totaled million in  representing a increase from the million earned in the increase in branch related fee income during can be attributed primarily to higher revenues from alternative investments offered to customers including mutual fund and annuity products  as well as growth in wire transfer fee income and analysis charges on commercial deposit accounts 
letters of credit fees and commissions  which represent revenues from trade finance operations as well as fees related to the issuance and maintenance of standby letters of credit  increased to million in  from million in the increase in letters of credit fees and commissions for both periods is primarily due to the higher revenues resulting from the growth in the volume of standby letters of credit during relative to the prior year as well as an increase in commissions generated from trade finance activities 
net gain on sales of investment securities available for sale increased to million during compared with million in sales of investment securities during provided additional liquidity to sustain the increase in our loan production activity 
ancillary loan fees consist of revenues earned from the servicing of mortgages  fees related to the monitoring and disbursement of construction loan proceeds  and other miscellaneous loan income 
ancillary loan fees increased to million in  compared to million in the increase in ancillary loan fees during is primarily due to a rise in servicing income received related to securitized loans

noninterest expense  which is comprised primarily of compensation and employee benefits  occupancy and other operating expenses increased to million during  compared to million during compensation and employee benefits increased to million in  compared to million in  primarily due to the addition of personnel throughout the year to support the company s continued growth as well as the impact of annual salary adjustments and related cost increases for existing employees 
increased staffing levels resulting from the acquisitions of dcb in august and standard bank in march further contributed to higher compensation expense during  relative to we anticipate compensation and employee benefit expenses to increase further during as a result of the impact of the dcb acquisition for the full year 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased to million during  compared with million during due to our continuing growth and expansion  we entered into several new leases during and related primarily to new branch locations  including the hong kong branch  as well as additional administrative locations 
further contributing to the increase in occupancy and equipment expenses during are the nine branch locations acquired from dcb 
similar to compensation and employee benefits  we anticipate occupancy and equipment expenses to increase during as a result of the dcb acquisition in august the amortization of premiums on deposits acquired decreased to million during  compared with million in the decrease in amortization expense during  compared with  is primarily due to the full amortization of deposit premiums related to the acquisition of american international bank aib which was consummated in january  partially offset by dcb 
we initially recorded million in deposit premiums in conjunction with the aib acquisition which were fully amortized in january annual amortization expense related to the aib acquisition was approximately thousand 
during the third quarter of  we recorded additional deposit premiums of million in connection with the acquisition of dcb in august premiums on acquired deposits are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
deposit related expenses decreased to million during  compared with million during deposit related expenses represent various business related expenses paid by the bank on behalf of its commercial account customers 
the decrease in deposit related expenses can be correlated to the decline in the volume of title and escrow deposit balances during relative to the prior year 
this segment of our deposit base has been adversely impacted by the overall slowing in the housing market both in production and sale 
the amortization of investments in affordable housing partnerships decreased to million in  from million in the decrease in amortization expense in is primarily due to a decrease in amortization expense related to one investment accounted for under the cost method 
investments accounted for under the cost method are amortized using a level yield method over the lives of the related tax credits 
this decrease was partially offset by additional purchases of investments in affordable housing partnerships during amounting to million 
total investments in affordable housing partnerships increased to million at december   compared to million at december  data processing expenses increased to million in  compared with million in the increase in data processing expenses is primarily due to increased transaction volume stemming from our overall growth  both organically and through acquisitions 
deposit insurance premiums and regulatory assessments remained at million during and pursuant to the federal deposit insurance reform act of  the bank is eligible to share in a one time assessment credit pool of approximately billion 
to be eligible for this credit  an institution must have been in existence on december   and have paid a deposit insurance assessment prior to that date  or be a successor to such an institution 
the bank s share is determined by multiplying its december  assessment base ratio by the amount of the assessment credit pool 
the bank s pro rata share of this one time assessment credit is approximately million which will be applied to reduce future deposit insurance assessments payable beginning with the june invoice 
as of december   million of the one time assessment credit has been applied to the bank s deposit insurance assessments  with the remaining credit to be applied in other operating expenses include advertising and public relations  telephone and postage  stationery and supplies  bank and item processing charges  insurance expenses  legal  consulting and other professional fees  and charitable contributions 
other operating expenses increased to million in  compared with million in this increase in other operating expenses is largely due to expenses incurred to support our continued overall growth 
comparing to  noninterest expense increased million  or  to million 
the increase is comprised primarily of the following an increase in compensation and employee benefits of million  or  primarily due to the acquisitions of united national bank in september and standard bank in march as well as the impact of salary adjustments and related costs for existing employees  an increase in occupancy expenses of million  or  reflecting additional rent expense from the combined sixteen branches acquired from united national bank and standard bank  as well as the relocation and expansion of corporate headquarters to pasadena  california  increasing rent  common area  and depreciation expenses  an increase in the amortization of premiums of acquired deposits of million  or  due to additional deposit premiums recorded in connection with the acquisitions of standard bank in and united national bank in  and an increase in other operating expenses of million  or  due primarily to our continued overall growth and expansion  both organically and through acquisitions  as well as higher expenses related to advertising  public relations  marketing efforts and donations to enhance our overall image and visibility in the community and the banking industry 
the company s efficiency ratio increased marginally to in  compared to in despite our continued expansion and growth  we have managed to sustain our operational efficiencies as a result of past and ongoing infrastructure investments 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes increased to million in  compared with million in the increase in the provision for income taxes is primarily attributable to a increase in pretax earnings during the provision for income taxes in also reflects the utilization of federal affordable housing tax credits totaling million  compared to million utilized in the provision reflects an effective tax rate of  compared with for comparing to  the provision for income taxes increased to million in  compared with million in this increase is primarily attributable to a increase in pretax earnings in the provision for income taxes in also reflects the utilization of affordable housing tax credits totaling million  compared to million utilized in the provision reflects an effective tax rate of  compared with for as previously reported  the california franchise tax board  or ftb  announced on december  that it is taking the position that certain tax deductions related to regulated investment companies will be disallowed pursuant to california senate bill and california assembly bill  which were signed into law in the fourth quarter of east west securities company  inc  a regulated investment company  or ric  formed and funded in july to raise capital in an efficient and economical manner was dissolved on december  as a result of  among other reasons  proposed legislation to change the tax treatments of rics 
the fund provided state tax benefits beginning in until the end of  when the ric was officially dissolved 
while the company s management continues to believe that the tax benefits realized in previous years were appropriate and fully defensible under the existing tax codes at that time  the company has deemed it prudent to participate in the voluntary compliance initiative  or vci  offered by the state of california to avoid certain potential penalties should the ftb choose to litigate its recently announced position about the tax treatment of rics for periods prior to enactment of the legislation described above and should the ftb be successful in that litigation 
pursuant to the vci program  we filed amended california income tax returns on april  for all affected years and paid the resulting taxes and interest due to the ftb 
this amounted to an aggregate payment of million for tax years   and we continue to believe that the tax deductions are appropriate and  as such  we have also filed refund claims for the amounts paid with the amended returns 
these refund claims are reflected as assets in the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result of these actions amending our california income tax returns and subsequent related filing of refund claims we retain our potential exposure for assertion of an accuracy related penalty should the ftb prevail in its position  in addition to our risk of not being successful in our refund claim for taxes and interest 
our potential exposure to all other penalties  however  has been eliminated through this course of action 
the ftb is currently in the process of reviewing and assessing our refund claims for taxes and interest for tax years through management is continuing to pursue these claims  to monitor developments in the law in this area  and to monitor the status of tax claims with respect to other registered investment companies 
we have considered this claim in our evaluation of uncertain tax provision in accordance with the provisions of fin pursuant to the adoption of fin on january   we recorded a cumulative effect accounting adjustment to retained earnings of million  net of the federal tax impact of million  related to these refund claims 
there has been no change to this amount during the year ended december  see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
operating segment results the company has identified four principal operating segments for purposes of management reporting retail banking  commercial lending  treasury  and residential lending 
although all four operating segments offer financial products and services  they are managed separately based on each segment s strategic focus 
while the retail banking segment focuses primarily on retail operations through the bank s branch network  certain designated branches have responsibility for generating commercial deposits and loans 
the commercial lending segment  which includes commercial real estate  primarily generates commercial loans and deposits through the efforts of commercial lending officers located in the bank s northern and southern california production offices 
the treasury department s primary focus is managing the bank s investments  liquidity  and interest rate risk  the residential lending segment is mainly responsible for the bank s portfolio of single family and multifamily residential loans 
the company s remaining centralized functions and eliminations of inter segment amounts have been aggregated and included in other 
future changes in the company s management structure or reporting methodologies may result in changes in the measurement of operating segment results 
results for prior periods have been restated for changes in management structure or reporting methodologies that have occurred during the year ended december  for more information about our segments  including information about the underlying accounting and reporting process  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
retail banking the retail banking segment s pre tax income decreased to million in  compared to million in the decrease in pre tax income for the retail banking segment for is primarily due to a million increase in loan loss provisions compounded by a million  or  increase in noninterest expense  partially offset by a million  or  increase in noninterest income  relative to the provision for loan losses for this segment increased million during  relative to  due to increased substandard loan classifications for loans originated by this segment 
noninterest income for this segment increased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the increase in noninterest income during is primarily due to fee income growth from loan origination and deposit gathering activities  as well as higher fees earned from alternative investment product offerings at the branches 
loan and deposit fee income from the lending units and nine additional branches acquired from dcb in august further contributed to the increase in noninterest income during  relative to noninterest expense for this segment increased to million in from million in the increase in noninterest expense during is primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits  occupancy expenses and other operating expenses  partially offset by a decrease in commercial deposit related expenses 
the increase in compensation and employee benefits can be attributed to higher staffing levels due to the addition of relationship officers and operational personnel throughout the past year 
additionally  the acquisition of dcb in august also contributed to higher compensation expense during higher occupancy expenses are due primarily to increased expenses associated with new branch locations as well as the nine additional branch locations acquired from dcb in august the increase in other operating expenses can be attributed predominantly to the overall growth in this segment arising from organic growth as well as recent acquisitions 
the decrease in commercial deposit related expenses can be correlated to lower title and escrow deposit balances during relative to the same periods in title and escrow deposits have been impacted by the downturn in the housing market 
commercial lending the commercial lending segment s pre tax income increased to million in  compared to million in the primary driver of the increase in pre tax income for this segment is a increase in net interest income to million in from million in the increase in net interest income during is primarily due to the notable growth of our commercial loan portfolio  which includes commercial real estate  construction  and commercial business loans  including trade finance products  during the past year 
specifically  the average aggregate balance of all commercial loan categories grew during as compared to noninterest income for this segment increased to million in  compared to million in the increase in noninterest income during is primarily due to an oreo net gain on sale of million  compared with only thousand in additionally  higher gains on sales of sba loans and other commercial real estate loans and an increase in letters of credit fees and commissions further contributed to the increase in noninterest income for this segment during  relative to noninterest expense for this segment increased to million in  compared to million in the increase in noninterest expense during is predominantly due to higher compensation and employee benefits resulting from the addition of relationship officers and operational personnel to support the continuing growth of the bank 
treasury the treasury segment s pre tax income increased to million in  compared to million in net interest income increased to million in from million in net interest income for this segment is directly correlated to net interest earned on investment securities relative to the interest expense paid on brokered deposits  borrowings and long term debt 
noninterest income for this segment increased to million in  compared to million in the increase in noninterest income during can be attributed almost entirely to higher net gains of sale of investment securities relative to noninterest expense for this segment increased to million in  compared with million in the increase in noninterest expense during is primarily due to a thousand impairment charge recorded on a trust preferred security in july residential lending the residential lending segment s pre tax income decreased to million in  from million in the decrease in pre tax income is partly due to the decrease in net interest income for this segment  which declined to million in  from million in the decrease in net interest income is primarily due to the bank s increased securitization activity of single family and multifamily loans which totaled billion during noninterest income for this segment increased during to million  or  from million during the net increase in noninterest income during  relative to  is primarily due to higher servicing income received as a result of the bank s ongoing securitization of its residential single family and multifamily loan portfolios 
noninterest expense for this segment increased to million in  compared to million in the increase in noninterest expense during is due to corporate cost reallocations 
balance sheet analysis total assets increased billion  or  to billion as of december  the increase is comprised predominantly of growth in net loans receivable of million  available for sale securities of million  goodwill of million  securities purchased under resale agreements of million and other assets of million  partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million 
we were able to fund the increase in loans and available for sale securities through increases in borrowings of million  long term debt of million  and deposit growth of million 
securities purchased under resale agreements we purchase securities under resale agreements resale agreements with terms that range from one day to several years 
total resale agreements increased to million as of december   compared with million as of december   all of which are long term agreements 
the million balance of resale agreements at december  is comprised of two agreements 
the first agreement amounting to million was entered into in january and has a year term 
the interest rate fixed at for the first two years and thereafter becomes floating rate 
the second agreement  amounting to million  was entered into by the company in may this resale agreement has a term of fifteen years with an interest rate that is fixed at for the first two years and thereafter becomes floating rate 
this resale agreement replaced a security in the amount of million that was called by the counterparty in may in september  a long term resale agreement in the amount of million was called by the counterparty 
there are no interest payments on these agreements if certain swap yield curves are inverted 
the collateral for these resale agreements consists of us government agency and or us government sponsored enterprise debt and mortgage backed securities held in safekeeping by a third party custodian 
purchases of securities under resale agreements are overcollateralized to ensure against unfavorable market price movements 
we monitor the market value of the underlying securities which collateralize the related receivable on resale agreements  including accrued interest 
in the event that the fair market value of the securities decreases below the carrying amount of the related repurchase agreement  our counterparty is required to designate an equivalent value of additional securities 
the counterparties to these agreements are nationally recognized investment banking firms that meet credit eligibility criteria and with whom a master repurchase agreement has been duly executed 
investment securities available for sale income from investing activities provides a significant portion of our total income 
we aim to maintain an investment portfolio with an adequate mix of fixed rate and adjustable rate securities with relatively short maturities to minimize overall interest rate risk 
our investment securities portfolio primarily consists of us treasury securities  us government agency securities  us government sponsored enterprise debt securities  us government sponsored and other mortgage backed securities  corporate debt securities  residual securities  and us government sponsored enterprise equity securities 
we currently classify our entire investment portfolio as available for sale  and accordingly  these securities are carried at their estimated fair values with the corresponding changes in fair values recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  as a component of stockholders equity 
total investment securities available for sale increased to billion as of december  the increase in available for sale securities is primarily due to the bank s increased securitization activity during total repayments maturities and proceeds from sales of available for sale securities amounted to billion and million  respectively  during proceeds from repayments  maturities  sales  and redemptions were applied towards additional investment securities purchases totaling million as well as funding a portion of loan originations made during we recorded net gains totaling million and million on sales of available for sale securities during and  respectively 
at december   investment securities available for sale with a carrying value of billion were pledged to secure public deposits  fhlb advances  repurchase agreements  and for other purposes required or permitted by law 
during  we completed several securitization transactions involving both single family and multifamily loans 
we securitized million in single family loans and million in multifamily loans through fannie mae 
we also securitized million in multifamily loans in a private label guaranteed mortgage securitization through east west mortgage securities  llc 
we recorded million in mortgage servicing assets in connection with these transactions as the bank continues to service the underlying loans 
we retained all of the resulting securities from these securitization transactions in our available for sale investment portfolio 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  a replacement of fasb statement no 
 these transactions were accounted for as neither sales nor financings with no gains or losses recorded to operations 
as previously mentioned  we plan to securitize additional single family loans as part of our ongoing strategy to reduce overall credit risk  enhance liquidity  and manage capital 
we perform regular impairment analyses on the investment securities available for sale portfolio 
if we determine that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  an impairment writedown is recognized in current earnings 
other than temporary declines in fair value are assessed based on the duration the security has been in a continuous unrealized loss position  the severity of the decline in value  the rating of the security and our ability and intent on holding the securities until the fair values recover 
the fair values of the company s investment securities are generally determined by reference to the average of at least two quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities 
in obtaining such valuation information from third parties  the company has evaluated the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values 
however  the distressed market conditions have impacted the company s ability to obtain third party pricing data for its portfolio of mortgage backed securities and corporate debt securities 
even when third party pricing has been available  the limited trading activity and illiquidity resulting from market conditions have challenged the observability of these quotations 
for those securities for which the company is unable to obtain more than one outside quoted market price  the company evaluates the broker s valuation methodology for reasonableness and obtains an independent validation of the market price received from another broker who has experience with such investments 
as of december   there were eight individual securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for twelve months or more 
these unrealized losses are primarily attributable to changes in interest rates 
these securities are comprised of four aaa rated agency debt securities  one aaa rated agency mortgage backed security  one aaa rated private label mortgage backed security  and two aa rated corporate debt securities 
as of december   there were also securities that have been in a continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months 
these securities are comprised of one aaa rated agency debt security  four aaa rated agency mortgage backed securities  three private label mortgage backed securities with ratings ranging from ba to aaa  six aa rated agency preferred stock securities  nine corporate debt securities with ratings ranging from bbb to a  and one corporate debt security with a b rating 
all of these securities had investment grade ratings upon purchase  and with the exception of one corporate debt security that was downgraded to a b rating by one rating agency shortly before year end  these securities maintained their long term investment grade status at december  these securities have fluctuated in value since their purchase dates as market interest rates have fluctuated 
we have the financial resources and the intent to hold these securities until their market values recover to cost 
the majority of unrealized losses in the available for sale portfolio at december  are related to aaa rated private label mortgage backed securities that we have retained in connection with our loan securitization activities 
as of december   the fair value of these securities totaled million  representing of our total investment portfolio 
gross unrealized losses related to these securities amounted to million  or of the aggregate amortized cost basis of these securities as of december  these unrealized losses are caused by lack of liquidity and market spreads resulting from instability in the residential real estate and credit markets 
the underlying loans are not subprime in nature and were originated by the bank in accordance with our customary underwriting standards 
the securities are supported by overcollateralization as of december  additionally  these securities are insured by a monoline insurance provider whose debt rating was recently affirmed by three major rating agencies 
as of december   we had million in corporate debt securities  representing of our total investment portfolio 
these debt instruments  which represent pooled trust preferred securities  had gross unrealized losses amounting to million  or of the total amortized cost basis of these securities as of december  almost all of the corporate debt instruments held by the company are trust preferred securities issued by banks and insurance companies 
of the different corporate debt securities that we have purchased  only three securities were issued by real estate investment trusts or homebuilder companies 
most of the corporate debt securities are overcollateralized and have subordination structures that management believes will afford sufficient principal and interest protection 
as mentioned earlier  one corporate debt security was downgraded to a b rating  from a bbb rating  by one rating agency shortly before year end the ratings for all other trust preferred securities in our available for sale portfolio have remained at investment grade as of december  we also had million in preferred securities issued by fannie mae and the federal home loan mortgage corporation freddie mac  representing of our total investment portfolio as of december  gross unrealized losses on these securities amounted to million as of december   all of which is unrealized loss under twelve months  or of the aggregate amortized cost basis of these securities 
these unrealized losses have resulted from an oversupply of newly issued preferred securities in connection with more stringent capital requirements imposed on these quasi governmental entities 
we believe that these unrealized loss positions are temporary in nature and are not due to credit or fundamental issues related to fannie mae or freddie mac 
moreover  since both fannie mae and freddie mac are government sponsored entities  their securities hold the implied backing of the us government 
during july  as a result of our periodic reviews for impairment  we recorded a thousand writedown on a trust preferred security that was held in our available for sale portfolio at an amortized cost of million 
we do not believe that there are any securities  other than those previously identified in prior periods  that are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired  and therefore  no additional impairment charges as of december  are warranted

our lending activities consist of residential single family loans  residential multifamily loans  commercial real estate loans  construction loans  commercial business loans  trade finance loans  and consumer loans 
net loans receivable increased million  or  to billion at december  the increase in loans during was funded primarily through growth in deposits  borrowings  and long term debt

we offer mortgage loans secured by one to four unit residential properties located in our primary lending areas 
at december   million or of the loan portfolio was secured by one to four family residential real estate properties  compared to million or at december  residential single family loan origination activity declined in  resulting in million in new loan originations during  compared with million in our loan origination activity during was adversely impacted by deteriorating conditions in the housing and mortgage markets 
we sold approximately million in conforming and non conforming residential single family loans through our secondary marketing efforts during  compared to million sold in the adverse conditions in the housing market have resulted in investors tightening their credit underwriting standards for qualifying loans 
moreover  government sponsored entities like fannie mae and freddie mac have increased their pricing structure and added other criteria for loans to qualify under their secondary market programs 
as a result of these developments  we anticipate our secondary market activities to be unfavorably impacted in the foreseeable future 
however  the newly passed congressional bill that will allow fannie mae and freddie mac to purchase loans up to  for a limited time period may provide a boost to our secondary market efforts by targeting certain segments of our jumbo loan customer base 
during  we securitized million in single family loans through fannie mae 
all of the resulting securities were initially retained in our available for sale investment portfolio 
the securitizations were accounted for as neither sales nor financings with no gains or losses recorded to operations 
we also recorded approximately million in mortgage servicing assets in connection with these securitizations since the bank continues to service the underlying loans 
we expect to securitize additional single family loans during as part of our ongoing strategy to manage our liquidity  capital and credit risk 
we offer both fixed and adjustable rate arm single family residential mortgage loan programs 
we primarily offer arm loan programs that have six month  three year  five year  or seven year initial fixed periods 
we originate single family residential mortgage loans under three different types of programs full alternative documentation  reduced documentation and no documentation loans 
the underwriting criteria for these loan programs vary in income and asset documentation levels 
our underwriting criteria for all the loans in our single family residential mortgage loan programs include minimum fico scores and maximum loan to value ratios 
additionally  our full alternative documentation loan program requires verification of employment and income 
reduced documentation loans are primarily intended for borrowers who are self employed 
generally  we require reduced documentation borrowers to have more equity in the property and higher amounts of liquid reserves 
finally  our no documentation loan program is designed for borrowers who demonstrate excellent credit quality and have the ability to place a large down payment or have high equity in the property 
of the million in residential single family mortgage loans originated during  or million were full alternative documentation loans  or million were reduced documentation loans and or million were no documentation loans 
in comparison  of the million residential single family mortgage loans originated during  or million were full alternative documentation loans  or million were reduced documentation loans  and or million were no documentation loans 
during for the no documentation loan program  the maximum ltvs ranged from to 
for the reduced documentation loan program  the maximum ltvs ranged from to 
historically  losses experienced from reduced documentation loans and no documentation loans have been minimal and we do not believe potential losses from these loans will be significant 
multifamily real estate loans 
we continue to place emphasis in the origination of multifamily loans and originated million multifamily loans during  as compared to million in although real estate lending activities are collateralized by real property  these transactions are subject to similar credit evaluation  underwriting and monitoring standards as those applied to commercial business loans 
multifamily real estate loans accounted for million or  and billion or  of our loan portfolio at december  and  respectively 
during  we securitized million in multifamily loans through fannie mae and another million in a private label guaranteed mortgage securitization 
all of the resulting securities were initially retained in our available for sale investment portfolio 
the securitizations were accounted for as neither sales nor financings with no gains or losses recorded to operations 
we recorded approximately million in mortgage servicing assets in connection with these securitizations since the bank continues to service the underlying loans 
we offer both fixed and adjustable rate multifamily loan programs 
we primarily offer adjustable rate multifamily loan programs that have six month  three year  or five year initial fixed periods 
we originate these multifamily mortgage loans under two different types of programs full documentation and reduced documentation 
of the million in multifamily loans originated during  or million were full alternative documentation and or million were reduced documentation loans 
in comparison  of the million multifamily loans originated during  or million were full alternative documentation loans and or million were reduced documentation loans 
the underwriting criteria for these loan programs vary in income and asset documentation levels  similar to our single family residential loan programs 
underwriting criteria generally include minimum fico scores  maximum loan to value ratios and minimum debt coverage ratios 
additionally  we own single family and multifamily residential mortgage loans that have contractual features that may increase our credit exposure 
these mortgage loans include adjustable rate mortgage loans that may subject borrowers to significant future payment increases or create the potential for negative amortization of the principal balance 
interest only mortgage loans allow interest only payments for a fixed period of time 
at the end of the interest only period  the loan payment includes principal payments and increases significantly 
the borrower s new payment once the loan becomes amortizing ie  includes principal payments will be greater than if the borrower had been making principal payments since the origination of the loan 
the longer the interest only period  the larger the amortizing payment will be when the interest only period ends 
as of december   there were million in interest only loans held in our portfolio 
in comparison  as of december   there were million in interest only loans held in the bank s portfolio 
historically  losses experienced from interest only loans have been minimal and we do not believe potential losses from these loans will be significant 
adjustable rate mortgage loans permit different repayment options 
the monthly payment for adjustable rate mortgage loans with negative amortization features is set as the initial interest rate for the first year of the loan 
after that point  the borrower can make a minimum payment that is limited to a increase in payment 
if the minimum payment is not adequate to cover the interest amount due on the mortgage loan  the loan would have negative amortization  which will result in an increase in the mortgage loans principal balance 
these loans completely re amortize every five years and the monthly payment is reset at that point 
none of the adjustable rate mortgages held in the bank s loan portfolio that have the potential to negatively amortize were actually negatively amortizing as of december  and the bank did not originate these loans and they were purchased several years ago 
we do not believe potential losses from these loans will be significant 
our total exposure related to these products in our loan portfolio for the years ended december  and is summarized as follows table nontraditional mortgage products unpaid principal balance as of december  in thousands interest only mortgage loans   adjustable rate mortgages with negative amortization features residential single family loans   residential multifamily loans   all of the loans we originate are subject to our underwriting guidelines and loan origination standards 
generally  loans obtained from third party originators  including the higher risk loans in the preceding table  are closed and funded in our name and are also subject to our same underwriting guidelines and loan origination standards 
we believe our strict underwriting criteria and procedures adequately consider the unique risks which may come from these products 
we conduct a variety of quality control procedures and periodic audits to ensure compliance with our origination standards  including our criteria for lending and legal requirements 
commercial real estate loans 
we continue to place emphasis in the origination of commercial real estate loans 
although real estate lending activities are collateralized by real property  these transactions are subject to similar credit evaluation  underwriting and monitoring standards as those applied to commercial business loans 
commercial real estate loans accounted for billion or  and billion or  of our loan portfolio at december   and  respectively 
since substantially all of our real estate loans are secured by properties located in california  declines in the california economy and in real estate values could have a significant effect on the collectibility of our loans and on the level of allowance for loan losses required 
construction loans 
we offer loans to finance the construction of income producing or owner occupied buildings 
at december   construction loans accounted for billion or of our loan portfolio 
this compares with billion or of the loan portfolio at december  total unfunded commitments related to construction loans increased to million at december   compared to million at december  as of december   the current balance of residential construction loans was approximately billion and the total commitment amount was billion  representing of total construction loans and of total gross loans 
the average ltv for residential construction loans in our portfolio is and the average loan size is approximately million 
although the residential construction market has been one of the most adversely impacted sectors by the downturn in the housing market  we believe that the overall asset quality of this loan portfolio remains sound 
all construction disbursements are being carefully monitored and reviewed to address key risks and factors in this portfolio  such as interest reserves remaining  number of homes sold  geographic area and concentration of loans 
commercial business loans 
we finance small and middle market businesses in a wide spectrum of industries throughout california 
included in commercial business loans are loans for working capital  accounts receivable lines  inventory lines  sba guaranteed small business loans and lease financing

at december   these loans to finance international trade totaled million or of our loan portfolio 
although most of our trade finance activities are related to trade with asian countries  a significant majority of our loans are made to companies domiciled in the united states 
a substantial portion of this business involves california based customers engaged in import activities 
in addition  we also offer ex im financing to various domestic and foreign exporters 
these loans are guaranteed by the export import bank of the united states 
approximately of our trade finance portfolio as of december  represents loans made to borrowers on the import side of international trade

contractual maturity of loan portfolio 
the following table presents the maturity schedule of our loan portfolio at december  all loans are shown maturing based upon contractual maturities  and include scheduled repayments but not potential prepayments

mortgage servicing assets are initially recorded at fair value 
the company primarily uses the services of an outside third party to provide independent valuations of its mortgage servicing assets 
the fair value of servicing assets is determined based on the present value of estimated net future cash flows related to contractually specified servicing fees 
the primary determinants of the fair value of mortgage servicing assets are prepayment speeds and discount rates 
published industry standards are used to derive market based assumptions 
evaluation of impairment is performed on a quarterly basis 
we record mortgage servicing assets for loans sold or securitized for which servicing has been retained by the bank 
based on the most recent quarterly valuation reports received  it appears that overall delinquency and prepayment rates related to the underlying sold or securitized loans have not changed significantly 
we do not expect a significant decline in the value of the msa until such events occur and do not expect this to be an area of significant weakness or deterioration in value in the near future 
for more information about our mortgage servicing assets  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
nonperforming assets loans are continually monitored by management and the board of directors 
generally  our policy is to place a loan on nonaccrual status if either i principal or interest payments are past due in excess of days  or ii the full collection of principal or interest becomes uncertain  regardless of the length of past due status 
when a loan reaches nonaccrual status  any interest accrued on the loan is reversed and charged against current income 
in general  subsequent payments received are applied to the outstanding principal balance of the loan 
nonaccrual loans that demonstrate a satisfactory payment trend for several months are returned to full accrual status subject to management s assessment of the full collectibility of the account

 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  as amended 
under sfas no 
 loans are considered impaired when it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  including scheduled interest payments 
all nonaccrual loans and all other loans graded substandard or doubtful with an outstanding balance of million or greater are individually evaluated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
to determine the potential level of impairment and to establish a specific reserve  if necessary 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as an expedient  at the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent  less costs to sell 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  the deficiency will be charged off against the allowance for loan losses or  alternatively  a specific allocation will be established 
also  in accordance with sfas no 
 loans that are considered impaired are specifically excluded from the quarterly migration analysis when determining the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses required for the period 
once loans have been classified as impaired  there is generally no interest recognition on these loans and any payments received on impaired loans are recorded as reductions in principal 
at december   the company s total recorded investment in impaired loans was million  compared with million at december  the increase in the impaired loans is largely due to an increase in nonperforming residential construction loans as well as the current economic conditions and the downturn in the housing market 
all nonaccrual and doubtful loans are included in impaired loans 
impaired loans at december  are comprised of single family loans totaling million  multifamily loans totaling million  commercial real estate loans totaling million  construction loans totaling million  commercial business loans totaling million  one trade finance loan amounting to million  sba loans totaling thousand  and home equity loans totaling thousand  and other consumer loans totaling thousand 
as of december   the allowance for loan losses included million for impaired loans with a total recorded balance of million 
there were no specific reserves on impaired loans at december  our average recorded investment in impaired loans during and totaled million and million  respectively 
during and  gross interest income that would have been recorded on impaired loans  had they performed in accordance with their original terms  totaled million and million  respectively 
of this amount  actual interest recognized on impaired loans  on a cash basis  was million and thousand  respectively 
allowance for loan losses we are committed to maintaining the allowance for loan losses at a level that is commensurate with estimated and known risks in the loan portfolio 
in addition to regular  quarterly reviews of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management performs an ongoing assessment of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
while we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate at december   future additions to the allowance will be subject to a continuing evaluation of estimated and known  as well as inherent  risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses which is charged against current period operating results  and is increased or decreased by the amount of net recoveries or chargeoffs  respectively  during the year 
at december   the allowance for loan losses amounted to million  or of total loans  compared with million  or of total loans  at december  the million increase in the allowance for loan losses at december   from year end  reflects million in additional loss provisions and million in loss reserves acquired from dcb  less million in net chargeoffs during the year 
the allowance for unfunded loan commitments  off balance sheet credit exposures  and recourse provisions is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities and amounted to million at december   compared to million at december  the provision for loan losses of million recorded in represents a increase from the million in loss provisions recorded during the increase in loss provisions recorded during  compared to  was driven by an increase in net chargeoffs  an increase in the volume of classified and nonperforming loans  and continued loan growth 
during  we recorded million in net chargeoffs representing less than of average loans outstanding during the year 
in comparison  we recorded net recoveries totaling thousand  or less than of average loans outstanding  during the following table summarizes activity in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated table allowance for loan losses at or for the year ended december  dollars in thousands allowance balance  beginning of year    allowance from acquisitions     allowance for unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit provision for loan losses     gross chargeoffs residential single family commercial and industrial real estate  construction  commercial business     trade finance   automobile other consumer total gross chargeoffs    gross recoveries residential single family residential multifamily commercial and industrial real estate commercial business trade finance  automobile other consumer total gross recoveries   net chargeoffs recoveries    allowance balance  end of year    average loans outstanding    total gross loans outstanding  end of year   net chargeoffs recoveries to average loans allowance for loan losses to total gross loans at end of year our primary methodology to determine the overall adequacy of the allowance is based on the classification migration model 
the result from this methodology is compared to analyses derived from peer group comparisons as well as the federal regulatory interagency policy for loan and lease losses to determine an overall allowance requirement amount 
in consideration of the significant growth and increasing diversity and credit risk profiles of loans in our loan portfolio in the past several years  our classification migration model utilizes sixteen risk rated loan pool categories and three homogeneous loan categories 
the loan sectors included in the risk rated loan pools are single family  multifamily  commercial real estate  construction  commercial business  trade finance  and automobile loans 
with the exception of automobile loans  all other risk rated categories have been broken down into additional subcategories 
for example  the commercial real estate loan category is further segmented into six subcategories based on industry sector  namely  retail  office  industrial  land  hotel motel  and other miscellaneous 
by sectionalizing these broad loan categories into smaller subgroups  we are better able to isolate and identify the risk associated with each subgroup based on historical loss trends 
in addition to the sixteen risk rated loan categories  our classification migration model also utilizes three homogeneous loan categories which encompass predominantly consumer related credits 
specifically  these homogeneous loan categories are home equity lines  overdraft protection  and credit card loans 
we utilize a loss horizon of sixteen years to better capture the bank s historical loss trends 
this loss horizon represents the timeframe when the bank started to monitor and track losses incurred in the loan portfolio 
we utilize a number of self correcting mechanisms to better reflect the loss potential for certain categories that have little or no historical losses 
during the third quarter of  we set an upper limit of basis points as the maximum differential between historical loss rates and minimum loss rates for loans with a pass rating in all loan categories 
the allowance requirement for each pool continues to be based on the higher of historical loss factors or established minimum loss rates for each classification category ie pass  special mention  substandard  and doubtful 
in prior periods  minimum loss factors were established to address the loss potential associated with the various portfolios and to preclude the application of migration analysis loss factors which may be mathematically correct from a historical view point  but did not adequately measure the risk of a portfolio given current loan originations  in terms of volume and size of loan  industry concentrations and or the economy 
effective with the quarter ended march  and in accordance with new regulatory guidance  the bank no longer utilizes minimum loss rates when calculating the migration requirement portion of the overall reserve total 
risks associated with factors other than historical loss rates are now addressed through the use of qualitative adjustments 
besides quantitative adjustments  the enhanced classification migration methodology also utilizes qualitative adjustments 
these qualitative adjustments include credit concentrations  delinquency  nonaccrual and problem loan trends  experience of lending personnel  and quality of the loan review system  economic risk considerations  and modeling risk associated with the classification migration model 
qualitative adjustments can be either positive or negative  and generally range from to 
total net qualitative adjustments for each loan pool are reflected as a percent adjustment and are calculated on top of the required allowance amount based on historical losses or minimum loss rates 
the following table reflects the company s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the ratio of each loan category to total loans as of the dates indicated

loss reserves on residential multifamily loans decreased in line with the decrease in multifamily loans resulting from our internal securitization activity 
loss reserves for construction and commercial business loans increased at december   reflecting the downturn in the residential real estate market and conditions in the overall economy 
deposits we offer a wide variety of deposit account products to both consumer and commercial customers 
total deposits increased million to billion at december  time deposit products  consisting primarily of retail fixed rate certificates of deposit  totaled billion at december  and comprised of the total deposit portfolio at year end in comparison  time deposits amounted to billion at december   also representing of the total deposit portfolio as of that date 
core deposits  or non time deposit accounts  increased to billion at december   and represented the remaining of the deposit portfolio at december  core deposits  which include noninterest bearing demand accounts  interest bearing checking accounts  savings accounts and money market accounts  accounted for the remainder of the deposit portfolio at both december  and deposit growth remained challenging as we continued to experience heightened market competition for deposits throughout deposits increased to billion at december   from billion at december   largely due to million in deposits acquired from dcb 
net deposit growth was comprised of increases in noninterest bearing demand accounts of million or  interest bearing checking accounts of million or  savings accounts of million or  and time deposits of million or 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in money market accounts of million or during the year 
we continue to rely on brokered deposits as a supplemental source of funding 
however  during  we took advantage of more favorable rates available from alternate funding sources to meet the company s liquidity needs 
at december   total brokered deposits amounted to million  compared with million at december  public deposits increased to million at december   from million at december  a large portion of these public funds are comprised of deposits from the state of california

during august  we assumed million in term fhlb advances from dcb with a two year maturity term and a fixed rate of 
in addition to federal funds purchased and fhlb advances  we also utilize securities sold under repurchase agreements repurchase agreements to manage our liquidity position 
repurchase agreements totaled million at december   compared with million at december  the increase in repurchase agreements at december  is due to a new repurchase agreement amounting to million that we entered into in september this repurchase agreement has a term of ten years and an interest rate that was initially fixed at basis points for the first three months 
thereafter  the rate is subject to a quarterly floating rate  subject to a specified floor and cap rate 
additional collateral may be requested from the counterparty when determined to be appropriate 
partially offsetting this transaction was the termination of a million repurchase agreement that was called by the counterparty in august all of the other repurchase agreements are long term with ten year maturity terms 
the rates are all initially floating rate for a period of time ranging from three months to three years 
thereafter  the rates are fixed for the remainder of the term  with interest rates ranging from to 
the counterparty has the right to either a one time call or a quarterly call when the rates change from floating to fixed  for each of the repurchase agreements 
repurchase agreements are accounted for as collateralized financing transactions and recorded at the amounts at which the securities were sold 
the collateral for these agreements consist of us government agency and us government sponsored enterprise debt and mortgage backed securities 
during the second and fourth quarters of  we modified the terms of a million repurchase agreement that we initially entered into in september  in response to the rising interest rate environment 
under the terms of the most recent modification  the interest rate on this ten year instrument for the period from december  through june  is based on the three month libor minus basis points 
thereafter  the rate is fixed at through the extended maturity date of december  the original maturity date of this agreement was september  under the terms of the most recent modification  the counterparty has the right to call the transaction on june   and quarterly thereafter until maturity 
also during the fourth quarter of  we modified the terms of a million repurchase agreement that we initially entered into in november  in response to the rising interest rate environment 
under the modified terms of this ten year agreement  the interest rate for this instrument for the period from november  through november  is based on the three month libor minus basis points 
thereafter  the rate is fixed at through the maturity date of november  under the terms of the most recent modification  the counterparty has the right to call the transaction on november   and quarterly thereafter until maturity 
the differences in the present values of the cash flows under the new terms of these debt instruments are less than of the present values of the remaining cash flows under the original or previously modified terms 
as such  these modifications of debt terms are not considered substantial  and therefore  do not constitute as debt extinguishments in accordance with the provisions of eitf  debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments 
no gains or losses were recorded in the consolidated statements of income as a result of these debt modifications 
included in the balance of repurchase agreements as of december  are million in overnight repurchase agreements with customers that we assumed in conjunction with the dcb acquisition in august these overnight repurchase agreements with customers had interest rates ranging from to as of december  long term debt as of december   long term debt totaled million  compared to million at december  long term debt is comprised of subordinated debt and junior subordinated debt issued in connection with our various trust preferred securities offerings 
the increase in long term debt at december  is due to the issuance of million in two separate pooled trust preferred offerings during the first and third quarters of similar to previous offerings  these securities were issued through newly formed statutory business trusts that are wholly owned subsidiaries of the company 
the securities for trust viii  amounting to million  have a year scheduled maturity on june  and bear interest at a per annum rate based on the three month libor plus basis points  payable on a quarterly basis 
at december   the interest rate on the securities issued by trust viii was 
the securities for trust ix  totaling million  have a year scheduled maturity on september  and bear interest at a per annum rate based on the three month libor plus basis points  payable on a quarterly basis 
at december   the interest rate on the securities issued by trust ix was 
these additional issuances of trust preferred securities qualify as tier i capital for regulatory purposes similar to previous offerings 
off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations in the course of our business  we may enter into or be a party to transactions that are not recorded on the balance sheet and are considered to be off balance sheet arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements are any contractual arrangements whereby an unconsolidated entity is a party  under which we have any obligation under a guarantee contract  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity for such assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  or any obligation under a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or engages in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
loan securitizations and sales in the ordinary course of business  the company sells loans with or without recourse 
for loans sold with recourse  the recourse component is considered a guarantee 
in certain situations  the company could also have an obligation for loans sold without recourse 
additional information pertaining to our loan sales is included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
from time to time  we securitize certain real estate loans  a portion of which are sold to investors 
securitizations provide us with a source of liquidity and also reduce our credit exposure to borrowers 
securitizations involve the sale of loans to a qualifying special purpose entity  or qspe  typically a trust 
generally  in a securitization  we transfer financial assets to a qspe that is legally isolated from the company 
the qspe  in turn  issues interest bearing securities  commonly called asset backed securities  which are secured by future collections on the sold loans 
the qspe sells securities to investors  which entitle them to receive specified cash flows during the term of the securities 
the qspe uses proceeds from the sale of these securities to pay the purchase price for the sold loans 
the proceeds from the issuance of the securities are then distributed to the company as consideration for the loans transferred 
when we sell or securitize loans  we generally retain the right to service the loans and we may retain residual and other interests  which are considered retained interests in the securitized assets 
retained interests may provide credit enhancement to the investors and represent the company s maximum risk exposure associated with these transactions 
investors in the securities issued by the qspe have no further recourse against the company if cash flows generated by the securitized assets are inadequate to service the obligations of the qspe 
additional information pertaining to our securitization transactions and related retained interests is included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report 
commitments  guarantees and contingencies as a financial service provider  we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit to customers  such as loan commitments  commercial letters of credit for foreign and domestic trade  standby letters of credit  and financial guarantees 
many of these commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon 
the same credit policies are used in extending these commitments as in extending loan facilities to customers 
under some of these contractual agreements  the company may also have liabilities contingent upon the occurrence of certain events 
a schedule of significant commitments to extend credit to customers as of december  is as follows table significant commitments december  in thousands undisbursed loan commitments  standby letters of credit  commercial letters of credit  a discussion of significant contractual arrangements under which the company may be held contingently liable is included in note to the company s consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere in this report

these transactions were offset by payments of quarterly cash dividends totaling million  an increase of million in unrealized losses on available for sale investment securities  a change in accounting principle pursuant to the adoption of fin amounting to million  and purchases of treasury stock totaling million  representing  shares of common stock 
private placement offerings during  we issued a total of million in junior subordinated debt securities in two pooled trust preferred offerings 
similar to previous offerings  these securities were issued through two newly formed statutory business trusts  trust viii and trust ix  wholly owned subsidiaries of the company 
the proceeds from the debt securities are loaned by the trusts to the company and are included in long term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the junior subordinated debt securities issued qualify as tier i capital for regulatory reporting purposes 
in store banking agreement on august   we entered into a ten year agreement with ranch market to provide in store retail banking services to their stores throughout california 
ranch market is the largest asian focused chain of supermarkets on the west coast 
tawa supermarket companies is the parent company of ranch market 
in conjunction with this agreement  we issued  warrants to senior executives of ranch market to purchase common stock of the company at a price of per share 
these warrants vested over six years and were intended to provide direct benefit to ranch market executives who made significant contributions to the success of the in store banking operations 
the estimated total fair value of the issued warrants was million 
as of december   all of the  warrants issued under this agreement have been exercised 
we did not experience any material increases in expenses or capital investments as a result of this agreement with ranch market 
risk based capital we are committed to maintaining capital at a level sufficient to assure our shareholders  our customers and our regulators that our company and our bank subsidiary are financially sound 
we are subject to risk based capital regulations adopted by the federal banking regulators in january these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures 
according to the regulations  institutions whose tier i and total capital ratios meet or exceed and  respectively  are deemed to be well capitalized 
at december   the bank s tier i and total capital ratios were and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  at december  the following table compares east west bancorp  inc s and east west bank s actual capital ratios at december   to those required by regulatory agencies for capital adequacy and well capitalized classification purposes table regulatory required ratios east west bancorp east west bank minimum regulatory requirements well capitalized requirements total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets asset liability and market risk management liquidity liquidity management involves our ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily operations  which include funding of securities purchases  providing for customers credit needs and ongoing repayment of borrowings 
our liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by the asset liability committee and the board of directors 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet the needs of the bank  including adequate cash flow for off balance sheet instruments 
our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and brokered deposits  federal funds facilities  repurchase agreement facilities  advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco  and issuances of long term debt 
these funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans  the routine liquidation of securities from the available for sale portfolio and securitizations of loans 
primary uses of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits  originations and purchases of loans  purchases of investment securities  and payment of operating expenses 
during the years ended december  and  we experienced net cash inflows of million and million  respectively  from operating activities 
net cash inflows from operating activities during and were primarily due to net income earned during the year 
net cash outflows from investing activities totaled million and billion during and  respectively 
net cash outflows from investing activities for both periods can be attributed primarily to the growth in our loan portfolio and purchases of available for sale securities 
these activities were partially offset by repayments  maturities  redemptions and net sales proceeds from investment securities 
we experienced net cash inflows from financing activities of million during the year ended december   primarily due to proceeds from federal funds purchased  fhlb advances and long term debt 
these factors were partially offset by a net decrease in deposits and purchases of treasury shares related to our board approved share repurchase program 
during  deposit growth  proceeds from federal funds purchased  repurchase agreements  fhlb advances and long term debt  accounted for net cash inflows from financing activities totaling billion 
as a means of augmenting our liquidity  we have available a combination of borrowing sources comprised of fhlb advances  federal funds lines with various correspondent banks  and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies 
we believe our liquidity sources to be stable and adequate to meet our day to day cash flow requirements 
at december   we are not aware of any information that was reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity position 
the liquidity of east west bancorp  inc is primarily dependent on the payment of cash dividends by its subsidiary  east west bank  subject to limitations imposed by the financial code of the state of california 
for the years ended december  and  total dividends paid by the bank to east west bancorp  inc amounted to million and million  respectively 
the large increase in dividend payments by the bank to the company during is primarily due to share repurchases totaling million in connection with the board authorized stock repurchase program announced during  and to a lesser degree  the increase in quarterly cash dividends to per share  from per share  commencing in the first quarter of as of december   approximately million of undivided profits of the bank were available for dividends to the company 
interest rate sensitivity management our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk  which is the impact of adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our net interest income and net portfolio value 
although in the normal course of business we manage other risks  such as credit and liquidity risk  we consider interest rate risk to be our most significant market risk and could potentially have the largest material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the fundamental objective of the asset liability management process is to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while maintaining adequate levels of liquidity and capital 
our strategy is formulated by the asset liability committee  which coordinates with the board of directors to monitor our overall asset and liability composition 
the committee meets regularly to evaluate  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses on the available for sale portfolio including those attributable to hedging transactions  if any  purchase and securitization activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
our overall strategy is to minimize the adverse impact of immediate incremental changes in market interest rates rate shock on net interest income and net portfolio value 
net portfolio value is defined as the present value of assets  minus the present value of liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the attainment of this goal requires a balance between profitability  liquidity and interest rate risk exposure 
to minimize the adverse impact of changes in market interest rates  we simulate the effect of instantaneous interest rate changes on net interest income and net portfolio value on a monthly basis 
the table below shows the estimated impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and market value of equity as of december  and  assuming a parallel shift of to basis points in both directions table rate shock table net interest income volatility net portfolio value volatility change in interest rates basis points december  december  december  december  the percentage change represents net interest income for twelve months in a stable interest rate environment versus net interest income in the various rate scenarios 
the percentage change represents net portfolio value of the bank in a stable rate environment versus net portfolio value in the various rate scenarios 
all interest earning assets  interest bearing liabilities and related derivative contracts are included in the interest rate sensitivity analysis at december  and at december  and  our estimated changes in net interest income and net portfolio value were within the ranges established by the board of directors 
our primary analytical tool to gauge interest rate sensitivity is a simulation model used by many major banks and bank regulators  and is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model attempts to predict changes in the yields earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities in relation to changes in market interest rates 
as an enhancement to the primary simulation model  prepayment assumptions and market rates of interest provided by independent broker dealer quotations  an independent pricing model and other available public sources are incorporated into the model 
adjustments are made to reflect the shift in the treasury and other appropriate yield curves 
the model also factors in projections of anticipated activity levels by product line and takes into account our increased ability to control rates offered on deposit products in comparison to our ability to control rates on adjustable rate loans tied to the published indices 
the following table provides the outstanding principal balances and the weighted average interest rates of our financial instruments as of december  the information presented below is based on the repricing date for variable rate instruments and the expected maturity date for fixed rate instruments

thereafter  interest rates become adjustable based on a predetermined index 
expected maturities of assets are contractual maturities adjusted for projected payment based on contractual amortization and unscheduled prepayments of principal as well as repricing frequency 
expected maturities for deposits are based on contractual maturities adjusted for projected rollover rates and changes in pricing for deposits with no stated maturity dates

we sometimes use derivative financial instruments as part of our asset and liability management strategy  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest margin and stockholders equity 
the use of derivatives has not had a material effect on our operating results or financial position

the combined notional amounts of the equity swap agreements total million with termination dates similar to the stated maturity date on the underlying certificate of deposit host contracts

on april   the company amended the four equity swap agreements entered into in effectively removing the swap payable leg 
the amendments to the swap agreements changed the terms of the agreements such that instead of paying interest based on the one month libor minus a spread on a monthly basis for the remaining terms of the agreements  we prepaid this amount based on the current market value of the cash streams 
the total amount paid in conjunction with these swap agreement amendments was million on april  the fair values of both the embedded derivatives and equity swap agreements amounted to million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the significant increase in the fair value of the derivative contracts since december  can be attributed to a rise in the index value combined with a increase in the implied volatility of the hscei call options as of december   relative to year end in december  the company entered into two additional equity swap agreements with a major investment brokerage firm to hedge against market fluctuations in a promotional equity index certificate of deposit product offered to bank customers

the option value is derived based on the volatility  the interest rate and the time remaining to maturity of the call option
