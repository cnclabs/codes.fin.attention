item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in the following discussion  general communication  inc and its direct and indirect subsidiaries are referred to as we  us and our 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to unbilled revenues  cost of goods sold accruals  allowance for doubtful accounts  share based compensation expense  depreciation  amortization and accretion periods  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
see also our cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data as presented in item of this form k 
general overview through our focus on long term results  acquisitions  and strategic capital investments  we strive to consistently grow our revenues and expand our margins 
we have historically met our cash needs for operations  regular capital expenditures and maintenance capital expenditures through our cash flows from operating activities 
historically  cash requirements for significant acquisitions and major capital expenditures have been provided largely through our financing activities 
our four reportable segments are consumer  network access  commercial and managed broadband 
our reportable segments are business units that offer different products  are each managed separately  and serve distinct types of customers 
the network access segment provides services to other common carrier customers and the managed broadband segment provides services to rural school districts and hospitals and health clinics 
following are our segments and the services and products each offers to its customers reportable segments services and products consumer network access commercial managed broadband voice long distance x x x local access x x x directories x video x x data internet x x x x private line and private networks x x x managed services x x managed broadband services x wireless x x x an overview of our services and products follows 
voice services and products long distance we generate long distance services revenues from monthly plan fees and usage charges 
factors that have the greatest impact on year to year changes in long distance services revenues include the rate per minute charged to customers and usage volumes expressed as minutes of use 
common carrier traffic routed to us for termination in alaska is largely dependent on traffic routed to our common carrier customers by their customers 
pricing pressures  new program offerings  and market and business consolidations continue to evolve in the markets served by our other common carrier customers 
if  as a result  their traffic is reduced  or if their competitors costs to terminate or originate traffic in alaska are reduced  our traffic will also likely be reduced  and our pricing may be reduced to respond to competitive pressures  consistent with federal law 
additionally  disruption in the economy resulting from terrorist attacks and other attacks or acts of war could affect our carrier customers 
we are unable to predict the effect on us of such changes 
however  given the materiality of other common carrier revenues to us  a significant reduction in traffic or pricing could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and liquidity 
at t acquired dobson  including its alaska properties  on november  in december we signed an agreement with at t that provides for an orderly four year transition of our wireless customers from the dobson at t network in alaska to our wireless facilities to be built in and the agreement allows our current and future customers to use the at t wireless network for local access and roaming during the transition period 
the four year transition period  which expires june   provides us adequate time to replace the dobson at t network in alaska with our own wireless facilities 
under the agreement  at t s obligation to purchase network services from us will terminate as of july  at t will provide us with a large block of wireless network usage at no charge to facilitate the transition of our customers to our facilities 
we will pay for usage in excess of that base transitional amount 
under the previous agreement with dobson  our margin was fixed 
under the new agreement with at t we will pay for usage on a per minute basis 
the block of wireless network usage at no charge will reduce cost of goods sold during the four year period ended june   that we would have otherwise recognized in accordance with the new agreement  however  we are unable to estimate the impact this change will have on our cost of goods sold 
due in large part to the favorable synergistic effects of our bundling strategy focused on consumer and commercial customers  long distance services continue to be a significant contributor to our overall performance  although the migration of traffic from our voice products to our data and wireless products continues 
our long distance service faces significant competition from at t alascom  acs  mta  long distance resellers  and certain smaller rural local telephone companies that have entered the long distance market 
we believe our approach to developing  pricing  and providing long distance services and bundling different services will continue to allow us to be competitive in providing those services 
local access we generate local access services revenues from four primary sources basic dial tone services  private line and special access services  origination and termination of long distance calls for other common carriers  and features and other charges  including voice mail  caller id  distinctive ring  inside wiring and subscriber line charges 
the primary factors that contribute to year to year changes in local access services revenues include the average number of subscribers to our services during a given reporting period  the average monthly rates charged for non traffic sensitive services  the number and type of additional premium features selected  the traffic sensitive access rates charged to carriers and amounts received from the universal service program 
we estimate that our december   and total lines in service represent a statewide market share of approximately  and  respectively 
at december   and approximately  and  respectively  of our lines are provided on our own facilities and leased local loops 
at december   and approximately  and  respectively  of our lines are provided using the une platform delivery method 
our local access service faces significant competition in anchorage  fairbanks  and juneau from acs  which is the largest ilec in alaska  and from at t alascom in anchorage for consumer services 
at t alascom has received certification from the rca to provide local access services in fairbanks and juneau 
in february  we began offering local access service in certain mta exchanges and face significant competition from mta 
in october  we began offering local access service in the kenai soldotna area and face significant competition from the ilec  acs 
we compete against other smaller ilecs in certain smaller communities 
we believe our approach to developing  pricing  and providing local access services and bundling different services will allow us to be competitive in providing those services 
in and the rca issued orders granting us certification to serve the service areas of ketchikan public utility  cordova telephone cooperative  copper valley telephone cooperative  mta  the glacier state area served by acs of the northland  alaska telephone company  interior telephone company  united kuc  astac and mukluk telephone company 
the affected rural local exchange carriers had appealed various aspects of the certification rulings 
we cross appealed questioning whether the rca had issued an untimely order beyond the statutory deadline when it approved the portion of the application granting us authority to serve wrangell  petersburg  seward  sitka and nome 
in rulings on october  and november   the superior court held that the rca s approval had been untimely and that our authority to serve those areas was effective immediately by operation of law 
in we expanded our local access service areas within alaska by offering facilities based services in eagle river  chugiak  wasilla  palmer  kenai soldotna  ketchikan  kodiak  sitka and valdez 
in we also began offering resale services in all of the glacier state study area and those areas in the mta study area in which we do not offer facilities based services 
we plan to continue to expand our local access service areas in and will offer service in these new areas using a combination of methods 
to a large extent  we plan to use our existing coaxial cable network to deliver local access services 
where we do not have cable facilities  we may resell other carriers services  lease portions of an existing carrier s network or seek wholesale discounts 
we plan to have deployed more than  dlps lines which utilize our coaxial cable facilities by december  this service delivery method allows us to utilize our own cable facilities to provide local access service to our customers and avoid paying local loop charges to the ilec 
the usf pays subsidies to etcs to support the provision of local access service in high cost areas 
under fcc regulations  we have qualified as a competitive etc in the anchorage  fairbanks  juneau  matanuska susitna valley  ketchikan and glacier state service areas 
without etc status  we would not qualify for usf subsidies in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer local access services  and our revenue for providing local access services in these areas would be materially adversely affected 
the federal state joint board on universal service has issued recommendations to the fcc for curbing growth in the fund  and the fcc has initiated rulemaking proceedings to consider these and its own proposals 
we cannot predict at this time the outcome of these proceedings or their impact on us 
these and any future regulatory  legislative  or judicial actions could affect the operation of the usf and result in a change in our revenue for providing local access services in new and existing markets and facilities based wireless services in new markets 
we have signed an agreement to purchase the uui and unicom telecommunications subsidiaries of uci for million 
additionally we may assume approximately million in net debt as part of the acquisition 
this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including regulatory approval 
we have filed applications with the rca and fcc seeking the requisite regulatory consent for the transaction 
the fcc comment cycle is completed  and the parties are awaiting fcc action 
gci is currently filing replies to comments and the statutory date for a final rca decision is may  the results of operations generated by the acquired companies will impact our voice and data services in all of our segments 
this transaction will close upon regulatory approval which is expected in the second or third quarter of directories we sell advertising in our yellow pages directories to commercial customers  distribute white and yellow pages directories to customers in certain markets we serve  and offer an on line directory 
video services and products we generate cable services revenues from three primary sources digital and analog programming services  including monthly basic and premium subscriptions  pay per view movies and one time events  such as sporting events  equipment rentals  and advertising sales 
our cable systems serve communities and areas in alaska  including the state s five largest population centers  anchorage  fairbanks  the matanuska susitna valley  the kenai peninsula  and juneau 
the primary factors that contribute to period to period changes in cable services revenues include average monthly subscription rates and pay per view buys  the mix among basic  premium and digital tier services  the average number of cable television subscribers during a given reporting period  set top box utilization and related rates  revenues generated from new product offerings  and sales of cable advertising services 
we increased rates charged for certain cable services in eleven communities  including four of the state s five largest population centers  anchorage  fairbanks  the matanuska susitna valley  and the kenai peninsula 
the rate increases were primarily effective in january and increased approximately for those customers who experienced an adjustment 
in the fourth quarter of we increased rates charged for certain cable services in seven communities  including the state s five largest population centers 
the rates increased approximately for those customers who experienced an adjustment

selected key performance indicators for our managed broadband segment follow december  percentage change managed broadband segment schoolaccess customers rural health customers managed broadband segment revenues managed broadband segment revenue  which includes data products only  increased to million in as compared to the increase is primarily due to increased circuits purchased by our rural health and schoolaccess customers and several product sales that did not occur in managed broadband segment cost of goods sold managed broadband segment cost of goods sold increased million to million from to primarily due to costs associated with the product sales and increased circuits purchased as discussed above 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in primarily due to the following recognition of million in additional expense resulting from our january  acquisition of alaska digitel  a million increase in labor and benefits costs  and a million increase in bad debt expense primarily due to the realization of recoveries for certain managed broadband services customers and mci  inc merged with verizon communications  inc 
in through a reduction to bad debt expense which did not recur in the selling  general and administrative expenses increase is partially off set by the following a million decrease in certain promotion expenses  and a  decrease in our company wide success sharing bonus accrual in as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in from in  primarily due to the net increases described above without a proportional increase in revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in the increase is primarily due to our million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in  the million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during the year ended december  for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in  and the increased depreciation and amortization expense recognized in on the depreciable and amortizable assets recorded upon the acquisition and consolidation of alaska digitel 
the depreciation and amortization expense increase is partially off set by the  software impairment recognized in upon the closure of an operating segment 
other expense  net other expense  net of other income  increased to million in primarily due to the following a million or increase in interest costs due to an increase in our average outstanding debt balance in as compared to  a million or decrease in interest income in resulting from a decrease in our average cash and cash equivalents balance in as compared to  and in the third quarter of  we substantially modified our senior credit facility resulting in loan fee expense of  the increases described above are partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest from  in to million in income tax expense income tax expense totaled million and million in and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate increased from in to in primarily due to increases in permanent differences in at december   we have tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million that will begin expiring in if not utilized  and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately million available to offset regular income taxes payable in future years 
we estimate that we will utilize net operating loss carryforwards of million to million during the year ended december  our utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards is subject to limitations pursuant to internal revenue code section we have recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to  and that expire from to  and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in and  and that expire in and  respectively 
tax benefits associated with recorded deferred tax assets are considered to be more likely than not realizable through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards 
the amount of deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced which would result in additional income tax expense 
we estimate that our effective annual income tax rate for financial statement purposes will be to in the year ended december  cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on january  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas r requires us to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures at the time of grant and periodically revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we record share based compensation expense only for those awards expected to vest using an estimated forfeiture rate based on our historical pre vesting forfeiture data 
previously  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred under the pro forma disclosure provisions of sfas for periods prior to the transition impact benefit of adopting sfas no 
r attributed to accruing for expected forfeitures on outstanding share based awards totaled  which was reduced by income tax expense of  and is reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle during the year ended december  in the accompanying consolidated income statements

restructuring charge in august we committed to a reorganization plan to more efficiently meet the demands of technological and product convergence by realigning along customer lines rather than product lines 
the reorganization plan included integration of several functions resulting in the layoff of employees by november  during the year ended december  we recognized a restructuring charge of million for workforce reduction costs across all functions 
total costs incurred under this plan were million 
the following table sets forth the restructuring charges by segment during amounts in thousands consumer network access commer cial managed broadband total reportable segments restructuring charge incurred through the year ending december  depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in the increase is primarily due to our million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during for which a full year of depreciation was recorded in  the million investment in equipment and facilities placed into service during the year ended december  for which a partial year of depreciation was recorded in  and a  software impairment recognized in upon the closure of an operating segment 
other expense  net other expense  net of other income  decreased to million in primarily due to the following in august  we finalized a million amended senior credit facility to replace our may  senior credit facility resulting in the following expenses o we recognized a million loss on early extinguishment of debt in resulting from termination of our satellite transponder capital lease  and o we recognized million in amortization and write off of loan and senior notes fees in because a portion of the amended senior credit facility was a substantial modification of the may  senior credit facility

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of current liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and other financing as needed to support our facilities expansion 
we believe  but can provide no assurances  that we will be able to meet our current and long term liquidity and capital requirements and fixed charges through our cash flows from operating activities  existing cash  cash equivalents  credit facilities  and other external financing and equity sources 
should operating cash flows be insufficient to support additional borrowings and principal payments scheduled under our existing credit facilities  capital expenditures will likely be reduced 
cash flows from operating activities totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  other sources of cash during the year ended december  included a million borrowing on our senior credit facility  million of collateral released and returned to us  and million from the issuance of our class a common stock 
other uses of cash during the year ended december  included expenditures of million for property and equipment  including construction in progress  million to acquire alaska digitel  million to repay a note payable and convertible debenture previously owed by alaska digitel  repayment of million of our senior credit facility  purchase of million of common stock to be retired and held for corporate purposes  and the purchase of million of other assets and intangible assets 
working capital totaled million at december   a million decrease as compared to million at december  the decrease is primarily due to cash paid for capital expenditures  the alaska digitel acquisition and debt repayment 
net receivables increased million from december  to december  primarily due to payment timing on trade receivables from several large customers  an increase in amounts due from the universal service administrative company usac  the addition of million net receivables due to the acquisition of alaska digitel  and an increase in trade receivables for managed broadband services provided to hospitals and health clinics due to the timing of payments received 
senior notes we have outstanding senior notes of million at december  we pay interest of on the senior notes and they are due in the senior notes are carried on our consolidated balance sheet net of the unamortized portion of the discount  which is being amortized to interest expense over the term of the senior notes 
the senior notes are not redeemable prior to february  at any time on or after february   the senior notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  on not less than thirty days nor more than sixty days notice  at the following redemption prices  plus accrued and unpaid interest if any to the date of redemption if redeemed during the twelve month period commencing february of the year indicated redemption price and thereafter the senior notes restrict gci  inc and certain of its subsidiaries from incurring debt  but permits debt under the senior credit facility and vendor financing as long as our leverage ratio does not exceed to one 
in addition  certain other debt is permitted regardless of our leverage ratio  including debt under the senior credit facility not exceeding and reduced by certain stated items million  reduced by the amount of any prepayments  or times earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization for the last four full fiscal quarters of gci  inc and certain of its subsidiaries 
the senior notes limit our ability to make cash dividend payments 
semi annual interest payments of million are payable in february and august of each year 
we were in compliance with all senior notes loan covenants at december senior credit facility in september we exercised our right to add an incremental facility of up to million to our existing senior credit facility 
the incremental facility was structured in the form of a million increase to the existing term loan component of our senior credit facility and a million increase to the existing revolving loan component of our senior credit facility 
the million incremental facility will become due under the same terms and conditions as set forth in the existing senior credit facility 
the senior credit facility which includes the incremental facility as discussed above includes a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility with a million sublimit for letters of credit 
our term loan is fully drawn 
we borrowed million under our revolving credit facility in december  and we have letters of credit outstanding totaling million at december  which leaves million available at december  to draw under the revolving credit facility if needed 
the term and revolving loan portions of our senior credit facility are due in and  respectively 
in we have borrowed an additional million under our revolving credit facility 
the incremental facility increased the interest rate on the term loan component of our senior credit facility from libor plus to libor plus 
the interest rate on the revolving loan component of the previous senior credit facility was libor plus a margin dependent upon our total leverage ratio ranging from to 
the incremental facility increased the revolving credit facility interest rate for our senior credit facility to libor plus the following applicable margin dependent upon our total leverage ratio total leverage ratio as defined applicable margin but but the annual commitment fee we are required to pay on the unused portion of the commitment is 
the senior credit facility total leverage ratio as defined limit is  the senior leverage ratio as defined limit is  and the fixed charge coverage ratio as defined must be less than subject to certain exceptions 
on may  our senior credit facility was amended to allow the exclusion of up to million of capital expenditures in aggregate from fixed charges as defined during the excluded capital expenditures period as defined beginning on may  and ending september  the incremental facility was a substantial modification of a portion of our existing senior credit facility resulting in a  write off of previously deferred loan fees during the year ended december  in our consolidated income statement 
deferred loan fees of  associated with the portion of our existing senior credit facility determined not to have been substantially modified continue to be amortized over the remaining life of the senior credit facility 
in connection with the incremental facility  we paid bank fees and other expenses of  during the year ended december  of which  were written off in the year ended december  and  were deferred and will be amortized over the remaining life of the senior credit facility 
borrowings under the senior credit facility are subject to certain financial covenants and restrictions on indebtedness  dividend payments  financial guarantees  business combinations  and other related items 
at december  we were in compliance with all loan covenants relating to our senior credit facility 
we expect to increase the amount available to borrow under our senior credit facility early in the second quarter of to ensure we have access to the capital required for our acquisitions and planned capital expenditures 
total long term debt as of december  maturities of long term debt were as follows amounts in thousands years ending december  and thereafter total capital lease obligation on march   through our subsidiary gcc we entered into an agreement to lease transponder capacity on intelsat s galaxy spacecraft that is expected to be launched may  we will also lease capacity on the horizons satellite  which is owned jointly by intelsat and jsat international  inc the leased capacity is expected to replace our existing transponder capacity on intelsat s galaxy xr satellite when it reaches its end of life 
we will lease c band and ku band transponders over an expected term of years once the satellite is placed into commercial operation in its assigned orbital location  and the transponders meet specific performance specifications and are made available for our use 
we will record the capital lease obligation of million and the addition to our property and equipment when the satellite is made available for our use which is expected to occur may  a summary of estimated future minimum lease payments for this lease follows amounts in thousands years ending december and thereafter total minimum lease payments capital expenditures our cash expenditures for property and equipment  including construction in progress  totaled million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
our capital expenditures requirements in excess of approximately million per year are largely success driven and are a result of the progress we are making in the marketplace 
we expect our expenditures for property and equipment for our core operations  including construction in progress and excluding the galaxy satellite transponder capacity lease discussed above and potential acquisitions discussed earlier  to total million to million  depending on available opportunities and the amount of cash flow we generate during planned capital expenditures over the next five years include those necessary for the expansion of alaska digitel s cdma network  construction of our gsm network  maintenance of existing facilities  growth of our long distance  local access  cable and internet facilities  improving network integrity  continuing deployment of dlps  adding new products  and introducing other new facilities and automation to reduce costs 
during alaska digitel and gci signed an agreement with sprint nextel to build out alaska digitel s cdma network to provide expanded roaming area coverage 
if we fail to meet the schedule  sprint nextel has the right to terminate the agreement and we may be required to pay up to million as liquidated damages 
we expect to meet the deadlines imposed by the build out schedule and therefore expect our expenditures to result in an expansion of our wireless facilities rather than payment of the liquidated damages 
to complete the cdma network build out  we signed an agreement to purchase cdma network equipment for million which is expected to be paid in on july   through our subsidiary gcc we entered into an agreement to purchase an iru in the kodiak kenai cable company  llc s marine based fiber optic cable system linking anchorage to kenai  homer  kodiak and seward  alaska 
the new system was placed into service in december we accepted the first installment of our iru capacity in december we have committed to purchase a minimum of million to million in additional iru capacity in two installments through we have entered into an agreement to purchase hardware and software capable of providing wireless service to small markets in rural alaska as a reliable substitute for standard wire line service 
the agreement has a total commitment of million 
we paid a million down payment in and expect to pay million  million  and million during the years ended december    and  respectively 
in we entered into several agreements to purchase submarine cable  amplifiers and line terminal equipment for our southeast alaska submarine fiber optic system project 
in addition to providing the equipment for the new submarine line  the contracts include additional equipment to upgrade the alaska united west submarine cable system and also include an option to increase capacity on the alaska united east submarine cable system 
the agreements have a total commitment of million 
we paid a million down payment in and expect to pay the remaining million in operating leases a summary of estimated future minimum lease payments for operating leases follows amounts in thousands years ending december and thereafter total minimum lease payments share repurchases gci s board of directors has authorized a common stock buyback program for the repurchase of our class a and class b common stock in order to reduce our outstanding shares of class a and class b common stock 
our board of directors authorized us and we obtained permission from our lenders for up to million of repurchases through december  we are authorized to continue our stock repurchases of up to million per quarter indefinitely and to use stock option exercise proceeds  in our discretion  to repurchase additional shares 
if stock repurchases are less than the total approved quarterly amount the difference may be carried forward and used to repurchase additional shares in future quarters 
during the year ended december  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of million 
we do not expect further share repurchases in the near term 
we will likely curtail our stock repurchases as a condition for increasing availability under our credit facilities 
when we begin generating free cash flow we may continue the repurchases subject to the availability under our credit facilities and the price of our class a and class b common stock 
the repurchases have and will continue to comply with the restrictions of sec rule b other expenditures and commitments effective january  we invested million in alaska digitel in exchange for an equity interest 
we do not have voting control of alaska digitel 
we funded the transaction from existing cash balances and by drawing down million under the revolving portion of our senior credit facility 
additionally  we entered into a revolving credit loan agreement with alaska digitel effective january  the loan agreement provides that alaska digitel can draw  subject to certain restrictions and financial covenants  up to million of which all was drawn during the year ended december  in january the revolving credit facility available to alaska digitel was increased to million 
in december  we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the remaining minority interest in alaska digitel for a total consideration of approximately million 
this transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including regulatory approval  but is expected to occur in the third quarter of at december  we had provided a million bank depository account as collateral for a term loan from a bank to alaska digitel 
the million collateral was released and returned to us in january we have an agreement with alaska airlines  inc alaska airlines to offer our consumer and commercial customers who make qualifying purchases from us the opportunity to accrue mileage awards in the alaska airlines mileage plan 
the agreement as amended has a remaining commitment at december  totaling million 
as previously described  in october we signed an agreement to purchase the stock of the uui and unicom telecommunications subsidiaries of uci for million expected to be paid upon closing 
additionally we may assume approximately million in net debt as part of the acquisition 
we will fund the transaction from cash on hand  by drawing down additional debt  or a combination of the two 
this transaction will close upon regulatory approval which is expected in the second or third quarter of as previously described  in december we signed a purchase agreement to acquire all of the interests in alaska wireless for million to million  expected to be paid upon closing 
in addition to the initial acquisition payment we have agreed to a contingent payment of approximately million in if certain financial conditions are met 
we will fund the transaction from cash on hand  by drawing down additional debt  or a combination of the two 
this transaction will close upon regulatory approval which is expected in the second or third quarter of the long distance  local access  cable  internet and wireless services industries continue to experience substantial competition  regulatory uncertainty  and continuing technological changes 
our future results of operations will be affected by our ability to react to changes in the competitive and regulatory environment and by our ability to fund and implement new or enhanced technologies 
we are unable to determine how competition  economic conditions  and regulatory and technological changes will affect our ability to obtain financing under acceptable terms and conditions

critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions  which are integral to understanding reported results 
critical accounting policies are those policies that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require management to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical in the preparation of financial statements 
these factors include  among other things  whether the estimates are significant to the financial statements  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information including third parties or available prices  and sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be utilized under gaap 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with our audit committee 
those policies considered to be critical accounting policies for the year ended december  are described below 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the likelihood that our customers will satisfactorily comply with rules necessary to obtain supplemental funding from the usac for services provided by us under our packaged communications offerings to hospitals  health clinics and rural school districts 
we base our estimates on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  financial health of specific customers  regional economic data  changes in our collections process  regulatory requirements  and our customers compliance with usac rules 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if they are unable to emerge from reorganization proceedings  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if their financial condition improves or they emerge successfully from reorganization proceedings  allowances may be reduced 
such allowance changes could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
impairment and useful lives of intangible assets we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required by sfas no 
 business combinations 
goodwill and indefinite lived assets such as our cable certificates and wireless licenses are not amortized but are subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment and quarterly evaluations of whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives primarily using the straight line method  and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount as required by sfas no 
and sfas no 
the initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded and subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of the applicability of quoted market prices in active markets and  if quoted market prices are not available and or are not applicable  how the acquired asset will perform in the future using a discounted cash flow analysis 
estimated cash flows may extend beyond ten years and  by their nature  are difficult to determine over an extended timeframe 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces  customer behaviors and attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures and technology  and changes in discount rates  performance compared to peers  material and ongoing negative economic trends  and specific industry or market sector conditions 
in determining the reasonableness of cash flow estimates  we review historical performance of the underlying asset or similar assets in an effort to improve assumptions utilized in our estimates 
in assessing the fair value of goodwill and other intangibles  we may consider other information to validate the reasonableness of our valuations including third party assessments 
these evaluations could result in a change in useful lives in future periods and could result in write down of the value of intangible assets 
our cable certificates  wireless licenses and goodwill assets are our only indefinite lived intangible assets and because of the significance of our cable certificate and goodwill assets to our consolidated balance sheet  our annual and quarterly impairment analyses and quarterly evaluations of remaining useful lives are critical 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  changes in market conditions or other externalities  or recognition of previously unrecognized intangible assets for impairment testing purposes could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
accruals for unbilled costs we estimate unbilled long distance services cost of goods sold based upon minutes of use carried through our network and established rates 
we estimate unbilled costs for new circuits and services  and network changes that result in traffic routing changes or a change in carriers 
carriers that provide service to us regularly make network changes that can lead to new  revised or corrected billings 
such estimates are revised or removed when subsequent billings are received  payments are made  billing matters are researched and resolved  tariffed billing periods lapse  or when disputed charges are resolved 
revisions to previous estimates could either increase or decrease costs in the year in which the estimate is revised which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
valuation allowance for net operating loss deferred tax assets our income tax policy provides for deferred income taxes to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million associated with income tax net operating losses that were generated from to  and that expire from to  and with charitable contributions that were converted to net operating losses in and  and that expire in and  respectively 
pre acquisition income tax net operating losses associated with acquired companies are subject to additional deductibility limits 
we have recorded deferred tax assets of approximately million associated with alternative minimum tax credits that do not expire 
significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for income taxes  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that may be required against the deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets as of december  based on management s belief that future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trends change  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies related to revenue recognition  share based payments  and financial instruments require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
certain of these and other matters are among topics currently under reexamination by accounting standards setters and regulators 
no specific conclusions reached by these standard setters appear likely to cause a material change in our accounting policies  although outcomes cannot be predicted with confidence 
a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
geographic concentration and the alaska economy we offer voice  data and wireless telecommunication services and video services to customers primarily throughout alaska 
because of this geographic concentration  growth of our business and of our operations depends upon economic conditions in alaska 
the economy of alaska is dependent upon the natural resource industries  and in particular oil production  as well as investment earnings  tourism  government  and united states military spending 
any deterioration in these markets could have an adverse impact on us 
all of the federal funding and the majority of investment revenues are dedicated for specific purposes  leaving oil revenues as the primary source of general operating revenues 
in fiscal the state of alaska reported that oil revenues  federal funding and investment revenues supplied  and  respectively  of the state s total revenues 
in fiscal state economists forecast that alaska s oil revenues  federal funding and investment revenues will supply  and  respectively  of the state s total projected revenues 
these forecasts incorporate alaska s clear and equitable share aces production tax  passed by the alaska legislature in november and signed into law in december with the new production tax  the revenue estimates are significantly higher than they would have been under the prior law 
the volume of oil transported by the transalaska oil pipeline system over the past years has been as high as million barrels per day in fiscal production has been declining over the last several years with an average of million barrels produced per day in fiscal the state forecasts the production rate to decline from million barrels produced per day in fiscal to million barrels produced per day in fiscal market prices for north slope oil averaged in fiscal and are forecasted to average in fiscal the closing price per barrel was on february  to the extent that actual oil prices vary materially from the state s projected prices  the state s projected revenues and deficits will change 
every change in the price per barrel of oil is forecasted to result in an increase of at least million in the state s fiscal revenue 
the production policy of the organization of petroleum exporting countries and its ability to continue to act in concert represents a key uncertainty in the state s revenue forecast 
the state of alaska maintains the constitutional budget reserve fund cbrf that is intended to fund budgetary shortfalls 
if the state s current projections are realized and no surpluses are deposited into the cbrf it will be depleted in the date the cbrf is depleted is highly influenced by the price of oil 
if the fund is depleted  aggressive state action will be necessary to increase revenues and reduce spending in order to balance the budget 
the governor of the state of alaska and the alaska legislature continue to evaluate cost cutting and revenue enhancing measures 
should new oil discoveries or developments not materialize or the price of oil become depressed  the long term trend of continued decline in oil production from the prudhoe bay area is inevitable with a corresponding adverse impact on the economy of the state  in general  and on demand for telecommunications and cable television services  and  therefore  on us  in particular 
periodically there are renewed efforts to allow exploration and development in the arctic national wildlife refuge anwr 
the united states energy information agency has estimated that it could take nine years to begin oil field drilling after approval of anwr exploration 
no assurance can be given that the driving forces in the alaska economy  and in particular  oil production  will continue at appropriate levels to provide an environment for expanded economic activity 
no assurance can be given that oil companies doing business in alaska will be successful in discovering new fields or further developing existing fields which are economic to develop and produce oil with access to the pipeline or other means of transport to market 
we are not able to predict the effect of changes in the price and production volumes of north slope oil on alaska s economy or on us 
deployment of a natural gas pipeline from the state of alaska s north slope to the lower states has been proposed to supplement natural gas supplies 
the economic viability of a natural gas pipeline depends upon the price of and demand for natural gas 
the governor of the state of alaska introduced natural gas pipeline legislation on march   which outlined project criteria that energy companies must meet in exchange for inducement incentives from the state of alaska to build a natural gas pipeline 
the state is currently in the process of evaluating proposals from various commercial entities 
such a project could have a positive impact on the state of alaska s revenues and could provide a substantial stimulus to the alaska economy 
development of the ballistic missile defense system project has had a significant impact on alaskan telecommunication requirements 
the system is a fixed  land based  non nuclear missile defense system with a land and space based detection system capable of responding to limited strategic ballistic missile threats to the united states 
the system includes deployment of up to ground based interceptor silos and battle management command and control facilities at fort greely  alaska 
the united states army corps of engineers awarded a construction contract and construction of test bed facilities began in as of january a total of twenty one ground based missile interceptors have been placed in underground silos 
the missile defense agency is reported to expect to emplace up to thirty interceptors in alaska by tourism  air cargo  and service sectors have helped offset the prevailing pattern of oil industry downsizing that has occurred during much of the last several years 
we have  since our entry into the telecommunication marketplace  aggressively marketed our services to seek a larger share of the available market 
the customer base in alaska is limited  however  with a population of approximately  people 
the state of alaska s population is distributed as follows are located in the municipality of anchorage  are located in the fairbanks north star borough  are located in the matanuska susitna borough  are located in the kenai peninsula borough  are located in the city and borough of juneau  and the remaining are located in other communities across the state of alaska 
seasonality revenue derived from our long distance services product in our network access segment have historically been highest in the summer months because of temporary population increases attributable to tourism and increased seasonal economic activity such as construction  commercial fishing  and oil and gas activities 
our long distance services product in our consumer and commercial segments and our other products in all our segments do not exhibit significant seasonality 
our ability to implement construction projects is hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures  snow and short daylight hours
