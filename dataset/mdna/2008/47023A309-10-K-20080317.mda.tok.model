table of contents jamba juice stores a primary goal of the company is to build accessibility  meaning making it easier for customers to experience jamba 
one way to accomplish that goal is to expand the number of jamba juice stores 
we have grown our concept and brand through company owned and operated stores company stores and franchise locations franchise stores 
as of january   there were jamba juice locations consisting of company stores and franchise stores operating in states and the bahamas 
except for the single bahamas franchise location we have no other international locations 
of the locations  stores are located in california  of which are company stores 
we lease the real estate for all of our company stores 
company stores we generally characterize our stores as either traditional or non traditional locations 
traditional locations are characterized as a business premise that exists primarily as a jamba juice store 
traditional stores average approximately  square feet in size and are designed to be fun  friendly  energetic and colorful to represent the active  healthy lifestyle that we promote 
these stores are located either in major urban centers or in suburban strip mall centers 
as of january   there were traditional jamba juice store locations 
non traditional locations are characterized as a jamba juice store located within another primary business or in conjunction with other businesses or at institutional settings such as colleges and universities  schools  shopping malls  supermarkets and airports 
a captive audience is a common characteristic of non traditional locations 
as of january   there were non traditional jamba juice store locations 
all jamba juice stores are designed to provide a highly interactive jamba experience to build our customer relationship  including the enticing aroma of fresh fruit  vegetables and wheatgrass  the high energy sounds of whirring blenders and team members calling out greetings 
the construction and color scheme employed at the stores provide a bright and cheerful marketplace theme with colors that embody our commitment to fresh and healthy juices  smoothies and other energizing products 
additionally  stores focus on the theater aspect of smoothie making by providing an environment in which all food preparation is conducted behind glass and in the open for customers to watch as the juices and smoothies are made with all natural ingredients 
the layout offers a casual bar type atmosphere using interior stools and exterior tables and chairs 
glass cases display baked goods and shelving in front of cash registers allow for the sale of baked goods and prepackaged healthy snack items 
our typical costs to construct a company store range from approximately  to over  depending upon location 
franchise stores our franchising program is currently conducted via i traditional store venues such as single store franchises to a franchisee  ii franchises granted for non traditional store venues and iii exclusive multi unit license agreements in which the franchisee develops and operates a specified number of stores within a specified period of time within a specified geographic area  which we call area development agreements 
our current franchise agreement provides for a year term 
the agreement is renewable for an additional year term  subject to various conditions and state law 
the royalty rate is typically of revenue  with franchisees required to contribute up to an additional of revenue for a non traditional store to a company administered marketing fund 
at the present time  in general  we are charging and of revenue as the marketing contribution for our traditional and non traditional franchisees  respectively 
there is typically a one mile geographic radius restriction for traditional stores in non downtown areas 
franchisees typically pay an initial fee ranging from  for non traditional store locations to  for traditional store locations 
we do not provide financing to our franchisees 
however  we may consider a joint venture investment in certain circumstances 
franchisees are obligated to finance their own build out of the store location according to our specifications 

table of contents area development agreements as of january   we had two multi unit area developers who have the right to develop additional franchise stores pursuant to multi unit license agreements 
the exclusive territories covered by these two multi unit area license agreements are i the hawaiian islands and ii parts of texas  kansas and missouri 
generally  a franchise agreement is entered into with each area developer with regard to each store opened under a multi unit license agreement 
these franchise agreements are generally the same as those entered into with franchisees who are not area developers 
even after a multi unit license agreement expires or is terminated  the area developer continues to operate the opened stores under each store s respective franchise agreement  including in most cases its contractually provided exclusive geographic radius restriction  which is typically one mile 
as of january   there were stores operating under the two current multi unit license agreements 
as of january   one of the two multi unit area developers had contractual commitments to open new franchise stores in their respective territories 
specifically  as of january   the area developer in parts of texas  kansas and missouri must open more new stores by may   the expiration date of this multi unit license agreement 
multi unit area development agreements can be deemed to be null and void if the terms of the agreement are not fulfilled 
although the multi unit developer for the hawaiian islands has satisfied its contractual commitment to open new franchise stores  it still has the exclusive right to open additional new stores through the expiration of its multi unit license agreement on june  under typical multi unit license agreements  the area developer generally pays one half of the  initial fee  or  for each store required to be developed upon execution of the multi unit development agreement as a development fee 
area developers are obligated to finance their own build out of each store location according to our specifications 
notwithstanding the exclusive territorial rights of the two multi unit area developers  we retain the right to franchise non traditional stores 
as of january   we have an agreement with safeway  inc for the opening of up to franchise stores within its grocery stores  of which were open 
store selection process we carefully screen prospective locations for visibility  traffic patterns  demographics  convenience  and co tenancy for potential company store and franchise store locations 
we select locations for new markets by targeting concentrations of early adopters that we believe will try the jamba experience and spread positive word of mouth about the brand 
in addition  we look for high traffic locations within urban areas before eventually spreading the concept to more suburban settings 
our expansion strategy involves using the hub and spoke model approach  which clusters stores around certain geographic locations 
we believe this approach has the potential to increase brand awareness and improve operating and marketing efficiencies 
we believe that the hub and spoke model helps to reduce costs associated with regional supervision of store operations  increase distribution efficiencies and provides us with the opportunity to leverage marketing costs over a greater number of stores 
in addition  we believe our ability to hire qualified team members is enhanced in markets in which we are well known 
growth strategy our current growth strategy is focused on building relevance and accessibility 
we build relevance through product innovation  marketing communications  the store environment and the customer experience 
we build accessibility through new store development  increased throughput and brand extensions 
the goal of building relevance and accessibility is increasing frequency and  as a result  comparable store sales and average unit volumes 
at the same time  we understand that the foundation for growth lies in strong store level economics 
accordingly  part of our growth strategy is to ensure that we achieve target metrics in terms of average unit volume  store level cash flow  store level cash flow margin  net cost per unit and cash on cash returns 

table of contents development of new stores we believe we have significant market expansion opportunities both nationally and internationally 
for fiscal  we opened new company stores  closed five company stores and acquired franchise locations 
franchisees opened stores and closed stores 
five of the closed franchise locations were in whole foods market as a result of whole foods expanding its prepared foods section 
we anticipate that we will continue to open on a moderate basis a combination of traditional and non traditional stores in both existing and new domestic markets 
we anticipate that this growth will be accomplished through the development of both company stores and franchise stores in non traditional venues 
the development of non traditional stores is expected to generate awareness to complement the traditional stores in the area 
we expect that possible future international development opportunities will primarily be pursued through area development or joint venture agreements with third parties 
development of business inspire and simplify healthy living our mission is to fuel customers active lifestyles by encouraging a healthy habit consisting of a regular dose of jamba juice 
building relevance and accessibility will lead to increasing frequency 
we view increased frequency from light users two or less times per month and medium users three to eight times per month as a significant opportunity that will drive same store revenue growth while mitigating revenue volatility 
to that end  our focus is on activities that have the potential to increase purchase occasion opportunities 
the jamba brand our brand practice is to inspire and simplify healthy living 
we believe eating healthier shouldn t be hard 
actually  it should be a pleasure 
we celebrate people s efforts to live healthier and recognize everyone is on their own personal journey towards a healthier lifestyle 
we want to make it easier for our customers  at jamba  you don t have to sacrifice great taste for health 
we have three pillars of healthy living we believe in the goodness of real whole fruit and things that come from this earth  we believe in being all natural and we believe in living a balanced life 
brand communication and awareness our strategy for brand communication focuses on delivering a clear message of the benefits of our products and the principles behind the jamba brand 
the delivery of the message must be fresh  interesting  and relevant to establish an emotional connection with the customer 
in addition to our out of store messaging  we employ the store experience as our primary communication vehicle  concentrating on ensuring that all touch points are consistent and clear in order to build brand awareness that will result in initial trial followed by repeat visits and positive word of mouth 
the communications encompass the colors  smells  displays and merchandise found in the store in addition to the energy of the team members 
we anticipate driving same store revenue growth by educating consumers on the benefits of jamba products  our usage occasions and the story of jamba juice 
the clarity and harmony of the message will create emotional connections with customers and build brand loyalty 
we are also continually striving to improve our customer s store experience 
in  we plan to roll out new and simplified menu boards and other in store communications collateral to make it easier for our customers to enjoy the healthy benefits of jamba 
we also plan to continue to redesign our stores  including exploring new technologies and other ways to improve customer throughput 
devoting additional resources to product optimization and innovation our research team continually seeks to enhance the product offerings available to customers  and where possible  reduce product and labor costs at the store level 
this process includes both the development of new products and the optimization of the menu to ensure only the most appealing products are offered to customers 
as new products are introduced to the menu  usage occasions increase and positive word of mouth is spread 
we are passionate about creating fresh new products that meet an even greater variety of customer needs 
we pride ourselves on listening carefully to customer feedback 
we continue to devote significant resources to our research and development team in an 
table of contents effort to build upon recent new product successes and take our product innovation abilities to the next level 
while there is no certainty that product development efforts will lead to the introduction and success of new product offerings as well as a potential increase in operating margins  we will continue to use these new resources to try to develop fresh concepts that appeal to customers at any time of day and in any weather or season 
our research team uses innovation to increase the relevance of our menu to both new and existing customers 
to attract customers concerned with calories  our research team developed jamba light and our sixteen ounce serving size 
to attract customers who want an all natural product without frozen dairy or sorbet  our research team developed all fruit smoothies 
to attract customers who have specific health concerns and goals  our research team developed jamba functionals 
and  to attract customers who want a substantial  satiating breakfast one of the fastest growing day parts in the quick service restaurant industry our research team has developed a new range of breakfast offerings  including chunky smoothies  hot stuff d pockets and fresh juice blends 
this combination of optimizing existing products and expanding our menu with offerings that are relevant to our customers needs provides increased opportunities for both increased frequency and increased per visit sales 
customer service our team members are responsible for the high level of customer service that is a key component of our success 
team members warmly greet customers upon entering the store and efficiently deliver their order in a timely manner 
with a highly customized product  operational efficiency is vital to achieving high levels of throughput 
our team members not only deliver the customers orders quickly  they also transfer the fun and energy they gain from working at jamba juice to the customers 
our management believes continuing to deliver high quality customer service will differentiate us in the marketplace and drive long term customer loyalty 
at the core of this jamba culture is fiber  an acronym for fun have fun  integrity act with integrity  balance strive for balance  empower empower yourself  and respectful be respectful 
company store operations customer service we try to provide our customers a positive experience by promoting interaction with our team members and encouraging a healthy  active lifestyle 
our goal is to build a powerful relationship with customers that transcends our core smoothie product line and goes beyond the four walls of our stores 
we strive to form this bond with our customers based on quality  trust and integrity 
to achieve this goal  we seek to hire customer service oriented people who exhibit our culture and values 
we train members to deliver a high quality customer experience and we provide team members with financial incentives and opportunities for advancement when they fulfill service expectations 
supported by the theater of the fully displayed production process  we believe that the jamba juice experience is a competitive advantage 
store management our operations team is the foundation for our performance and vital to long term growth 
we recruit and retain leaders with broad experience in management and our industry 
we support our store operations with a combination of regional directors of operations  district managers and general managers at each store 
maintaining our corporate culture is essential as we continue to expand  and we believe that it is critical to developing our brand and ensuring our continued success 
we believe team members are the key to our success and that our culture fosters personal interaction  mutual respect  trust  empowerment  enthusiasm and commitment 
we carefully screen potential team members to ensure that they hold many of our core values and fit into the culture 
by placing an emphasis on our mission statement and values  and encouraging responsibility and accountability at every level  we believe that it has created a sense of team member loyalty and an open and 
table of contents interactive work environment  resulting in a highly passionate workforce 
team members are paid competitive wages and are offered opportunities for rapid advancement 
in addition to competitive wages  store managers are eligible for performance based bonuses and retention bonuses 
training we conduct various training programs for team members  support center staff and our leadership team 
we are dedicated to providing a meaningful experience for all team members  with ample opportunity to develop leadership skills as they move up through the organization 
our training programs include formal programs such as the manager in training programs for new managers and the more informal one on one discussions held between general managers  district managers and regional directors of operations 
the goal of all the programs is to shorten the learning curve while creating greater confidence in order to achieve success through strong performance and results 
advertising and marketing our marketing strategy focuses on communicating the benefits of the products and the brand s values through many creative and non traditional avenues 
marketing efforts are concentrated on store locations to build memorable experiences that will generate positive word of mouth 
as we enter new markets we must communicate the jamba juice story  the benefits of our products and our usage occasions 
emotional connections are developed as the messages are delivered consistently and with a freshness that appeals to consumers 
we augment our in store communications with small promotional events  community involvement and opportunistic grass roots marketing 
we believe we benefit from national media attention  providing us a significant competitive advantage 
historically  we have not engaged in any mass media marketing programs  relying instead on word of mouth  trade area marketing and in store promotions to increase customer awareness 
nevertheless  we have been featured in stories appearing in the wall street journal  the new york times  usa today and a host of local newspapers and magazines 
we have also been featured in television shows such as dateline nbc  the oprah winfrey show  saturday night live  the sopranos and multiple times on late night with david letterman 
our fundraising events also capture a significant amount of coverage from local television stations 
in addition to the company s marketing efforts  franchisees also contribute to the development and deployment of system wide marketing programs 
franchisees also spend to market the company s brand in their local market area 
we also capitalize on the openings of new sites as opportunities to reach out to the media 
we try to secure live local television  radio broadcasts and coverage in local newspapers for each store opening 
in addition  openings are frequently associated with a charitable event to reinforce our strong commitment to our communities 
brand extensions the successful development of the jamba brand has positioned us well to extend our product offerings outside of our stores 
while our product is already highly portable and convenient  the opportunity to develop a jamba product line available in other outlets and formats would expand the brand accessibility and product usage occasions available to consumers 
our branding team will ensure that any product extensions fit the standard of product quality 
as an example  we recently announced an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with nestl usa to produce and distribute a line of healthy ready to drink beverages under the jamba brand name in product supply we are committed to providing only the finest smoothie  juice and other food products 
smoothie and juice products depend heavily upon supplies of fresh and fresh frozen fruit 
the quality of each smoothie depends to a 
table of contents large degree on the quality of the basic fruit ingredients from which it is made 
it is therefore essential that the supply of fruit is of the highest quality and is consistent throughout the year 
to achieve these dual goals we purchase our projected requirements for the coming year of a given type of fruit from suppliers at the height of the season for that particular fruit 
the supply and price of fresh and fresh frozen fruit are dependent upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and are subject to significant volatility 
supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing regions  including weather  natural disasters and regional political and economic conditions 
in addition  as we continue to grow  we will likely become more dependent upon global fruit supplies than we have in the past  which may result in natural disasters and global political and economic conditions having a greater effect on the supply and price of our fruit ingredients and our profitability 
we use only the highest quality fruit in our products 
we conduct quality assurance testing at the time of packing to ensure that the fruit meets our high standards  which meet or exceed usda grade a standards 
the fruit is then flash frozen and stored by the supplier s for shipment to distributors throughout the year 
we contract with independent distribution companies to distribute products to the stores 
the length of these contracts varies in duration 
given the density of stores in california  the costs of goods sold in california is lower than other regions of the country 
we believe that by clustering future store development we can begin to lower distribution costs  and therefore reduce cost of goods sold  in non california markets 
southwest traders  inc is a distributor of proprietary products to our company stores and franchise stores 
southwest traders distributed ingredients that made up approximately of cost of sales for jamba juice company s fiscal southwest traders does not manufacture or negotiate pricing agreements for products sold in our stores 
they serve solely in a warehousing and distribution capacity and receive a fixed mark up per case on the independently negotiated cost of our ingredients 
our contract does provide that during the term we will use southwest traders as our exclusive distributor within certain territorial boundaries provided they meet required service levels 
the contract is firm through december  and is not subject to cancellation unless either party defaults within the contract due to non performance 
all of our nutritional supplements ie  boosts  pretzels and baked goods are produced to very exacting specifications 
all products are shipped directly to stores using outside distributors 
we do not maintain central warehousing facilities 
competition the beverage industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
restaurants compete based on a number of factors  including quality  price value relationships  customer service  name recognition  employee hiring and retention and location 
we compete with a variety of purveyors of quick  convenient food and beverage products  including quick service restaurants  coffee shops  donut shops and grocery stores 
while competition in the beverage market is fragmented  competition is increasing  and a major competitor with substantially greater resources than the company could enter the market at any time and compete directly against jamba juice company 
we compete most directly with regional smoothie stores  most of which are franchises of other smoothie brands 
additionally  the rising popularity of convenient and healthy food items may result in increased competition from traditionally non smoothie retailers as they increase their offerings of smoothies and other juice related products 
in addition  we also face intense competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers for suitable sites for new stores and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to secure adequate sites at acceptable rent levels or that the company will be able to attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel 

table of contents government regulation and environmental matters government regulation 
we are subject to extensive and varied federal  state and local government regulation  including regulations relating to public health and safety and zoning codes 
we operate each of our stores in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable codes and regulations 
however  if we could not obtain or retain food or other licenses  it would adversely affect our operations 
although we have not experienced  and do not anticipate  any significant difficulties  delays or failures in obtaining required licenses  permits or approvals  any such problem could delay or prevent the opening of  or adversely impact the viability of  a particular store or group of stores 
california and other states and local jurisdictions have enacted laws  rules  regulations and ordinances which may apply to the operation of a company store  including those which a establish general standards  specifications and requirements for the construction  design and maintenance of the store premises  b regulate matters affecting the health  safety and welfare of our customers  such as general health and sanitation requirements for restaurants  employee practices concerning the storage  handling  cooking and preparation of food  special health  food service and licensing requirements  restrictions on smoking  exposure to tobacco smoke or other carcinogens or reproductive toxicants and saccharin  availability of and requirements for public accommodations  including restrooms  c set standards pertaining to employee health and safety  d set standards and requirements for fire safety and general emergency preparedness  e regulate the proper use  storage and disposal of waste  insecticides and other hazardous materials  f establish general requirements or restrictions on advertising containing false or misleading claims  or health and nutrient claims on menus or otherwise  such as low calorie or fat free  and g establish requirements concerning withholdings and employee reporting of taxes on tips 
in order to develop and construct more stores  we need to comply with applicable zoning  land use and environmental regulations 
federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on our operations to date  but more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors could delay or even prevent construction and increase development costs for new stores 
we are also required to comply with the accessibility standards mandated by the us americans with disabilities act  which generally prohibits discrimination in accommodation or employment based on disability 
we may  in the future  have to modify stores  for example  by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures  to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons 
while these expenses could be material  our current expectation is that any such action will not require us to expend substantial funds 
we are subject to the us fair labor standards act  the us immigration reform and control act of and various federal and state laws governing various matters including minimum wages  overtime and other working conditions 
we pay a significant number of our hourly staff at rates consistent with but higher than the applicable federal or state minimum wage 
accordingly  increases in the minimum wage would increase our labor cost 
we are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to our current and any future franchise operations 
see risk factors risks associated with jamba  inc s business and industry governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new stores or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results 
we are also subject to various federal and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and aspects of the licensor licensee relationships 
many state franchise laws impose restrictions on the franchise agreement  including the duration and scope of non competition provisions  the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply 
the federal trade commission  or the ftc  and some state laws also require that the franchisor furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise offering circular that contains prescribed information and  in some instances  require the franchisor to register the franchise offering 

table of contents environmental matters 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge  storage  handling  release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances 
these environmental laws provide for significant fines  penalties and liabilities  sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of  or was responsible for  the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of  or actual or alleged exposure to  such substances 
we cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future  how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with  or to satisfy claims relating to  environmental laws 
while  during the period of their ownership  lease or operation  our stores have not been the subject to any material environmental matters  we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations 
we have not conducted investigations of our properties to identify contamination caused by third party operations  in such instances  the contamination must be addressed by the third party 
if the relevant third party does not or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely  then under certain environmental laws  we could be held liable as an owner and operator to address any remaining contamination 
any such liability could be material 
further  we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties  and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations 
trademarks and domain names the company owns and or has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the united states and additional countries throughout the world 
rights to the trademarks and service marks in the united states are generally held by a wholly owned affiliate of the company and are used by the company under license 
some of the company s trademarks  including jamba juice and the jamba logo are of material importance to the company

the team participates in technical research and development activities  in addition to customary product testing and product and process improvements in all areas of its business 
seasonality our business is subject to day to day volatility based on weather and varies by season 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is realized during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year  which include the summer months 
the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  which encompasses the winter months and the holiday season  has traditionally been our lowest revenue volume quarter

risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
we must successfully gauge dietary and consumer preferences to succeed 
our success depends  in part  upon the popularity of our products and our ability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers 
shifts in consumer preferences away from our products  our inability to develop new 
table of contents menu items that appeal to consumers  or changes in our menu that eliminate items popular with some consumers could harm our business 
in  we launched jamba functionals a line of smoothies  boosts and shots specifically designed to help meet our customers health and lifestyle needs 
in  we rolled out several new products on a system wide basis to anchor our new breakfast platform 
these new products are designed to feature healthy  on the go items to attract new customers  increase the frequency of current customer visits  create a point of differentiation  and provide a more complete meal solution for our customers 
to the extent we misjudge the market for our products  our sales will be adversely affected  which will negatively impact our operating results 
in addition  with new menu items  we must anticipate and effectively respond to changing product mix ramifications 
these new products have new and different ingredients  vendors  lead times  packaging  and operational requirements than our existing products 
accordingly  our business may be harmed by unanticipated consequences such as an adverse effect on speed of service and higher cost of goods of these new products that could lead to suboptimal selection and timing of product purchases or subpar operational execution 
because our business is based primarily in california  a worsening of economic conditions  a decrease in consumer spending  or a change in the competitive conditions in this market may substantially decrease our revenues and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy 
our california company stores generated approximately of our company stores revenue 
we expect that our california operations will continue to generate a substantial portion of our revenue 
our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending  which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income 
the end of saw many consumers facing steep mortgage payments  tightening credit and rising energy and food prices  which adversely affected consumer spending 
accordingly  we may experience declines in revenue during economic downturns or during periods of uncertainty  especially if california is affected 
any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending leading to cost conscious consumers to be more selective in restaurants visited could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  results of operations  business and financial condition 
our inability to compete with the many food services businesses may result in reductions in our revenue and operating margins 
we compete with many well established companies  food service and otherwise  on the basis of taste  quality and price of product offered  customer service  atmosphere  location and overall guest experience 
we compete with other smoothie and juice bar retailers  specialty coffee retailers  yogurt and ice cream shops  bagel shops  fast food restaurants  delicatessens  caf s  bars  take out food service companies  supermarkets and convenience stores 
our competitors change with each of the four day parts breakfast  lunch  afternoon and dinner  ranging from coffee bars and bakery cafes to casual dining chains 
aggressive pricing by our competitors or the entrance of new competitors into our markets could reduce our revenue and operating margins 
we also compete with other employers in our markets for hourly workers and may become subject to higher labor costs as a result of such competition 
fluctuations in various food and supply costs  particularly fruit and dairy  could adversely affect our operating results 
supplies and prices of the various products that we use to prepare our offerings can be affected by a variety of factors  such as weather  seasonal fluctuations  demand  politics and economics in the producing countries 
the prices of fruit and dairy  which are the main products in our offerings  can be highly volatile 
fruit of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis  depending on supply and demand at the time of the purchase 
an increase in pricing of any fruit that we use in our products could have a significant adverse effect on our profitability 
for example  we experienced increased cost of sales as a result of significant price increases in certain citrus products due to the freeze on the california citrus crop in january if we are unable to pass 
table of contents along increased fruit and dairy costs  our margin will decrease and our profitability will suffer accordingly 
in addition  higher diesel and gasoline prices may affect our supply costs  near term construction costs for our new stores and may affect our revenue going forward 
for example  in some cases higher diesel prices have resulted in the imposition of surcharges on the delivery of commodities to its distributors  which they have generally passed on to us to the extent permitted under our arrangements with them 
to help mitigate the risks of volatile commodity prices and to allow greater predictability in pricing  we typically enter into fixed price or to be fixed priced purchase commitments for a portion of our fruit and dairy requirements 
we cannot assure you that these activities will be successful or that they will not result in our paying substantially more for our fruit supply than would have been required absent such activities 
we do have some multi year pricing agreements with certain vendors 
many communities have also recently banned polystyrene take out food packaging 
the company is actively working with its vendors to develop a less costly cup that satisfies energy  emissions and waste management concerns  but there is no guarantee that the company will be successful in its efforts 
we are primarily dependent upon one supplier for a significant amount of our food distribution 
we maintain food distribution contracts primarily with one supplier 
this supplier  southwest traders  inc  provided   and of cost of sales for our fiscal and and jamba juice company s fiscal and  respectively  which potentially subjects us to a concentration of business risk 
if this supplier had operational problems  our operations could be adversely affected 
litigation and publicity concerning food quality  health and other issues  which can result in liabilities and also cause customers to avoid our products  which could adversely affect our results of operations  business and financial condition 
food service businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers or government authorities resulting from food quality  allergens  illness  injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one retail location or a limited number of retail locations 
adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us  regardless of whether the allegations are true  by discouraging customers from buying our products 
we could also incur significant liabilities  if a lawsuit or claim results in a decision against us  or litigation costs  regardless of the result 
our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or labor shortages 
labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business 
we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our team members 
a considerable number of the team members employed by us and our franchisees are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage 
in  the federal minimum wage increased from to and it will increase again in to and in to 
additionally  many of our team members work in stores located in states where the minimum wage is greater than the federal minimum and receive compensation equal to the state s minimum wage 
during  we had state minimum wage increases in california  oregon  new york  arizona  washington  colorado  illinois and florida all above the federal minimum wage 
in addition  san francisco itself has a minimum wage requirement greater than the state of california 
these minimum wage increases and any further increases in the federal minimum wage or the enactment of additional state or local minimum wage increases will increase labor costs 
if we are unable or unwilling to increase our menu prices or take other actions to offset increased operating costs  our operating results will suffer 
additionally  competition and labor shortages in various markets could result in higher required wage rates 
food safety concerns and instances of food borne illnesses could harm our customers  result in negative publicity and cause the temporary closure of some stores and  in some cases  could adversely affect the price and availability of fruits and vegetables  any of which could harm our brand reputation  result in a decline in revenue or an increase in costs 
we consider food safety a top priority and dedicate substantial resources towards ensuring that our customers enjoy high quality  safe and wholesome products 
however  we cannot guarantee that our internal 
table of contents controls and training will be fully effective in preventing all food borne illnesses 
furthermore  our reliance on third party food suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food borne illness incidents such as e 
coli  hepatitis a  salmonella or listeria could occur outside of our control and at multiple locations 
instances of food borne illnesses  whether real or perceived  and whether at our stores or those of our competitors  could harm customers and otherwise result in negative publicity about us or the products we serve  which could adversely affect revenue 
if there is an incident involving our stores serving contaminated products  our customers may be harmed  our revenue may decrease and our brand name may be impaired 
if our customers become ill from food borne illnesses  we could be forced to temporarily close some stores 
if we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or other key aspects of the jamba juice experience  we may lose customers who do not accept those changes  and may not be able to attract enough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our stores profitable 
in addition  we may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of making any such changes and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors 
food safety concerns and instances of food borne illnesses and injuries caused by food contamination have in the past  and could in the future  adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause customers to shift their preferences  particularly if we choose to pass any higher ingredient costs along to consumers 
as a result  our costs may increase and our revenue may decline 
a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity  or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our stores  could materially harm our business 
the food service industry has inherent operational risks that may not be adequately covered by insurance 
we may not be adequately insured against all risks and our insurers may not pay a particular claim 
furthermore  in the future  we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates for our operations 
we may also be subject to calls  or premiums  in amounts based not only on our own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we receive indemnity insurance coverage for tort liability 
our insurance policies also contain deductibles  limitations and exclusions which  although we believe are standard in the food service industry  may nevertheless increase our costs 
we may face difficulties entering into new or modified arrangements with existing or new suppliers or new service providers 
as we expand our operations  we may have to seek new suppliers and service providers or enter into new arrangements with existing ones  and we may encounter difficulties or be unable to negotiate pricing or other terms as favorable as those we currently enjoy  which could harm our business and operating results 
if we cannot replace or engage new arrangements  suppliers and or service providers in a cost effective basis  we may need to change our purchasing practices  remove items from the menu  or make menu price adjustments 
these activities could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations 
the planned increase in the number of our stores may make our future results unpredictable 
there were company stores and franchise stores open as of january  in fiscal  we opened new company stores 
we currently expect to open new company stores in fiscal this growth strategy and the substantial investment associated with the development of each new store may cause our operating results to fluctuate and be unpredictable or adversely affect our profits 
our future results depend on various factors  including successful selection of new markets and store locations  market acceptance of the jamba juice experience  consumer recognition of the quality of our products and willingness to pay our prices which reflect our often higher ingredient costs  and the quality of our operations and general economic conditions 
in addition  as with the experience of other retail food concepts who have tried to expand nationally  we may find that the jamba juice concept has limited or no appeal to customers in new markets or we may 
table of contents experience a decline in the popularity of the jamba juice experience 
newly opened stores may not succeed  future markets and stores may not be successful and  even if we are successful  our average store revenue may not increase at historical rates 
our revenue growth rate depends primarily on our ability to open new stores and is subject to many unpredictable factors 
we may not be able to open new stores as quickly as planned 
we have experienced delays in opening some stores and that could happen again 
delays or failures in opening new stores could materially and adversely affect our growth strategy and expected results 
as we operate more stores  our rate of expansion relative to the size of our store base will decline 
in addition  one of our biggest challenges is locating and securing an adequate supply of suitable new store sites 
competition for those sites in our target markets is intense  and lease costs are increasing particularly for urban locations 
our ability to open new stores also depends on other factors  including negotiating leases with acceptable terms  hiring and training qualified operating personnel in local markets  managing construction and development costs of new stores at affordable levels  particularly in competitive markets  the availability of construction materials and labor  the availability of  and our ability to obtain  adequate supplies of ingredients that meet our quality standards  securing required governmental approvals including construction  parking and other permits in a timely manner  and the impact of inclement weather  natural disasters and other calamities 
our revenue and profit growth could be adversely affected if comparable store revenue are less than expected 
while future revenue growth will depend substantially on our plans for new store openings  the level of comparable store revenue will also affect our revenue growth and will continue to be an important factor affecting profit growth 
this is because the operating margin on comparable store revenue is generally higher than the operating margin on new store openings  as comparable store revenue enable fixed costs to be spread over a higher revenue base 
our ability to increase comparable store revenue depends in part on our ability to launch new products  implement successfully our initiatives to increase throughput and raise prices to absorb cost increases 
it is possible that we will not achieve our targeted comparable store revenue growth or that the change in comparable store revenue could be negative 
if this were to happen  new store expansion may be reduced and revenue and profit growth may be adversely affected 
our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 
our current plans call for new company stores in fiscal and a significant number of new stores thereafter 
our existing store management systems  financial and management controls and information systems may be inadequate to support our expansion 
managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance these systems  procedures and controls and to hire  train and retain store managers and crew 
we may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our expansion will impose on our management  employees and existing infrastructure 
we also place significant importance on our culture  which we believe has been an important contributor to our success 
as we grow  however  we may have difficulty maintaining our 
table of contents culture or adapting it sufficiently to meet the needs of our operations 
our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 
new stores  once opened  may not be profitable  and the increases in average store revenue and comparable store revenue that we have experienced in the past may not be indicative of future results 
historically  our new stores have opened with an initial ramp up period typically lasting approximately months or more  during which they generated revenue and profit below the levels at which we expect them to normalize 
this is in part due to the time it takes to build a customer base in a new market  higher fixed costs relating to increased construction and occupancy costs and other start up inefficiencies that are typical of new stores 
new stores may neither be profitable nor have results comparable to our existing stores 
in addition  our average store revenue and comparable store revenue may not continue to increase at the rates achieved over the past several years 
our ability to operate new stores profitably and increase average store revenue and comparable store revenue will depend on many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including executing our vision effectively  initial revenue performance of new stores  competition  either from our competitors in the smoothie industry or our own stores  changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending  consumer understanding and acceptance of the jamba juice experience  road construction and other factors limiting access to new stores  general economic conditions  which can affect store traffic  local labor costs and prices we pay for the ingredients and other supplies we use  and changes in government regulation 
if our new stores don t perform as planned  our business and future prospects could be harmed 
in addition  changes in our average store revenue or comparable store revenue could cause our operating results to vary adversely from expectations 
our expansion into new markets may present increased risks due to our unfamiliarity with those areas 
some of our new stores are planned for markets where we have little or no operating experience 
those markets may have different competitive conditions  consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets 
as a result  those new stores may be less successful than stores in our existing markets 
consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the jamba juice brand  and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned 
we may find it more difficult in new markets to hire  motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision  passion and culture 
stores opened in new markets may also have lower average store revenue than stores opened in existing markets  and may have higher construction  occupancy or operating costs than stores in existing markets 
what s more  we may have difficulty in finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us  either initially or over time  with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards 
revenue at stores opened in new markets may take longer to ramp up and reach expected revenue and profit levels  and may never do so  thereby affecting overall profitability 
if we expand into foreign markets we will be exposed to new uncertainties and risks  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
we are actively exploring expanding our operations into new foreign markets  which will expose us to new risks and uncertainties  including product supply  consumer preferences  occupancy costs  operating expenses 
table of contents and labor and infrastructure challenges 
in addition  consumers in a foreign market may not be familiar with the jamba juice brand  and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity 
finally  international operations have inherent risks such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the application and effect of local laws and regulations and enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights 
the company s earnings and growth of alternative distribution channels depends in large part on the success of its business partners  and the company s reputation may be harmed by actions taken by third parties 
in december  we announced an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with nestl usa to produce and distribute a line of healthy ready to drink beverages under the jamba brand name 
in the future  we may enter into agreements with other companies for the retail distribution of other product categories involving the licensing of the jamba juice trademarks 
our royalty income will be dependent on the success of the ready to drink beverages or any future licensed products  as well as the capability and execution of our business partner 
in addition  any failure by our business partner to adhere to the brand experience and standards expected by our customers may damage our reputation and brand value  which may potentially affect the results of operations 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of various factors  including the impact of inclement weather  natural disasters and other calamities or earthquakes  particularly those that may occur near our company s support center in northern california  unseasonably cold or wet weather conditions  the timing of new store openings and related revenue and expenses  operating costs at our newly opened stores  which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation  labor availability and wages of store management and team members  profitability of our stores  especially in new markets  changes in comparable store revenue and customer visits  including as a result of the introduction of new menu items  variations in general economic conditions  including those relating to changes in gasoline prices  negative publicity about the ingredients we use or the occurrence of food borne illnesses or other problems at our stores  changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending  increases in infrastructure costs  fluctuations in supply prices  and fluctuations in the fair value of the derivative liability associated with outstanding warrants 
because of these factors  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 
average store revenue or comparable store revenue in any particular future period may decrease 
in the future  operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and 
table of contents investors 
any failure to meet expectations  particularly for i comparable store sales  ii earnings per share  or iii new store openings could cause the market price of the company s stock to drop significantly 
our business and results may be subject to disruption from work stoppages  terrorism or natural disasters 
our operations may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons  including work stoppages  acts of war  terrorism  pandemics  fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters 
in particular  our corporate offices and support center is located in northern california  near known earthquake fault lines 
if a major earthquake or other natural disaster were occur in northern california  our corporate offices and support center may be damaged or destroyed 
such a disruption could result in the temporary or permanent loss of critical data  suspension of operations  delays in shipments of product and disruption of business in both the affected region and nationwide  which would adversely affect our revenue as a result 
our success depends substantially upon the continued retention of certain key personnel 
we believe that our success has depended and continues to depend to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities of our senior management team 
except for paul e 
clayton  donald d 
breen and karen kelley  the members of our management team currently are employed on an at will basis and may resign from employment at any time 
our failure to retain any of these individuals could adversely affect our ability to build on the efforts they have undertaken with respect to the jamba juice business 
our franchisees could take actions that harm our reputation and reduce our royalty revenue 
franchisees are independent contractors and are not our employees 
further  we do not exercise control over the day to day operations of our franchise stores 
any operational or development shortcomings of our franchise stores are likely to be attributed to our system wide operations and could adversely affect our reputation and have a direct negative impact on the royalty revenue we receive from those stores 
our revenue is subject to volatility based on weather and varies by season 
seasonal factors also cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
our revenue is typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people choose cold beverages and higher during the spring  summer and fall months for the opposite reason 
we may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying premium prices for higher quality food 
our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers to pay premium prices for our freshly blended beverages 
we may not successfully educate customers about the quality and benefits of our product offerings  and customers may not care 
failure to maintain premium pricing could require us to change our pricing  products  and strategies  which would adversely affect our brand identity 
we could face liability from our franchisees and from government agencies 
a franchisee or government agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisee franchisor relationships 
various state and federal laws govern our relationship with our franchisees and potential revenue of our franchised restaurants 
if we fail to comply with these laws  we could be liable for damages to franchisees and fines or other penalties 
expensive litigation with our franchisees or government agencies may adversely affect both our profits and our important relations with our franchisees 
we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing space subject to long term non cancelable leases and  with respect to the real property that we may own  in the future 
we compete for real estate and our inability to secure appropriate real estate or lease terms could impact the ability to grow 
our leases generally have initial terms of between five and years  and generally can be 
table of contents extended only in five year increments at increased rates if at all 
additionally  in certain instances  there may be change in control provisions in the lease which put us in a competitive disadvantage when negotiating extensions or which require us to get landlord consent for certain transactions 
all of our leases require a fixed annual rent  although some require the payment of additional rent if store revenue exceeds a specified amount 
generally  our leases are net leases  which require us to pay all of the cost of insurance  taxes  maintenance and utilities 
we generally cannot cancel these leases 
additional sites that we may lease are likely to be subject to similar long term non cancelable leases 
if an existing or future store is not profitable  and we decide to close it  we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including  among other things  paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term 
current locations of our stores and franchised locations may become unattractive as demographic patterns change 
in addition  as each of our leases expire  we may fail to negotiate renewals  either on commercially acceptable terms or at all  which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations 
restaurant companies  including jamba juice  have been the target of class action lawsuits and other proceedings alleging  among other things  violations of federal and state workplace and employment laws 
proceedings of this nature  if successful  could result in our payment of substantial damages 
our results of operations may be adversely affected by legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of employees or customers 
in recent years  a number of restaurant companies  including jamba juice company  have been subject to lawsuits  including class action lawsuits  alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters  discrimination  tip policy and similar matters 
a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial awards by the defendants 
similar lawsuits have been instituted against us in the past alleging violations of state and federal wage and hour laws and failure to pay for all hours worked 
although we are not currently a party to any class action lawsuits  we could incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits  which would increase the cost of operating the business and decrease the cash available for other such uses 
governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new stores or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results 
we are subject to various federal  state and local regulations 
each of our stores is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health  sanitation  food and workplace safety and other agencies 
we may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new stores  which could delay planned store openings 
in addition  stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new stores in particular locations 
we are subject to the us americans with disabilities act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment  public accommodations and other areas 
we may in the future have to modify stores  for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures  to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons 
the expenses associated with these modifications could be material 
our operations are also subject to the us fair labor standards act  which governs such matters as minimum wages  overtime and other working conditions  along with the us americans with disabilities act  family leave mandates and a variety of similar laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters 
in recent years  there has been an increased legislative  regulatory and consumer focus on nutrition and advertising practices in the food industry 
establishments operating in the quick service and fast casual segments have been a particular focus 
for example  the new york city board of health has adopted a regulation requiring that restaurants that make calorie information publicly available must include that information on their menus and menu boards 
we may in the future become subject to other initiatives in the area of nutrition disclosure or advertising  such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional content of our food  which could increase our expenses 

table of contents government mandatory healthcare requirements could adversely affect our profits 
the company pays a substantial part of the healthcare benefits for team members at the assistant general manager level and above and for those working at the company s support center 
other team members can purchase more limited healthcare benefits 
in  the san francisco healthcare security ordinance went into effect requiring covered employers to make minimum health care expenditures for their employees  to track such expenditures and to confirm compliance 
in addition  legislation is being proposed at the federal and state levels mandating employers to either provide health care coverage to their employees or pay into a fund that would provide coverage for them 
the company is currently analyzing the effect of the san francisco healthcare security ordinance on the profitability of its san francisco stores 
if this type of legislation is enacted in additional geographic areas where we do business  it could have an adverse effect on our profits 
our federal  state and local tax returns may  from time to time  be selected for audit by the taxing authorities  which may result in tax assessments or penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we are subject to federal  state and local taxes in the us in making tax estimates and paying taxes  significant judgment is often required 
although we believe our tax positions and estimates are reasonable  if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken by the company  we could have additional tax liability  including interest and penalties 
if material  payment of such additional amounts could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property  which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business 
our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business 
our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to build further brand recognition using our trademarks  service marks  trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property  including our name and logos and the unique ambiance of our stores both domestically and overseas 
we have secured the ownership and rights to our marks in the united states and have filed or obtained registrations for restaurant services in most other significant foreign jurisdictions 
if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate  or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property  either in print or on the internet  the value of our brands may be harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance 
while we have not encountered claims from prior users of intellectual property relating to restaurant services in areas where we operate or intend to conduct material operations  there can be no assurances that we will not encounter such claims 
if so  this could harm our image  brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 
we periodically acquire existing jamba juice stores from our franchisees  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
we have acquired jamba juice stores from our franchisees either by negotiated agreement or exercise of our rights of first refusal or purchase option under the franchise or area development agreement 
for example  in  we acquired jamba juice stores from franchisees 
any acquisition that we undertake involves risks  including  our ability to successfully and profitably transition acquired franchise stores into company stores 
failure to do so effectively could strain our financial and management resources as well as negatively impact our results of operations 
we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management  increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies 
our customers occasionally file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our stores  or that we have problems with food quality or 
table of contents operations 
we are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business  including personal injury claims  contract claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters  discrimination and similar matters  and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future 
regardless of whether any claims against us are valid  or whether we are ultimately held liable  claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance 
a judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage  or for which we are not covered by insurance  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects  which in turn could adversely affect our results 
in addition  the food services industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products they sell and disclosure and advertising practices 
we may also be subject to this type of proceeding in the future and  even if not  publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fast casual segments of the industry may harm our reputation or prospects and adversely affect our results 
we may also incur costs resulting from other security risks we may face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information 
we rely on commercially available software and other technologies to provide security for processing and transmission of customer credit card data 
approximately of our current revenue is attributable to credit card transactions  and that percentage is expected to climb 
our systems could be compromised in the future  which could result in the misappropriation of customer information or the disruption of systems 
either of those consequences could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business or subject it to additional liabilities 
failure of the company s internal control over financial reporting could harm its business and financial results 
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting 
internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
internal control over financial reporting includes i maintaining reasonably detailed records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions  and ii providing reasonable assurance that we a record transactions as necessary to prepare the financial statements  b makes receipts and expenditures in accordance with management authorizations  and c would timely prevent or detect any unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud 
any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud 
a significant financial reporting failure could cause an immediate loss of investor confidence in us and a sharp decline in the market price of our common stock 
results of operations may be volatile as a result of the impact of fluctuations in the fair value of our outstanding warrants from quarter to quarter 
our outstanding warrants are classified as derivative liabilities and therefore  their fair values are recorded as derivative liabilities on our balance sheet 
changes in the fair values of the warrants will result in adjustments to the amount of the recorded derivative liabilities and the corresponding gain or loss will be recorded in our statement of operations 
we are required to assess these fair values of derivative liabilities each quarter and as the value of the warrants is quite sensitive to changes in the market price of our stock  among other things  
table of contents fluctuations in such value could be substantial and could cause our results to not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
these fluctuations will continue to impact our results of operations as described above for as long as the warrants are outstanding 
the jamba  inc warrants will expire on june   or earlier upon redemption 
if persons engage in short sales of our common stock the price of our common stock may decline 
selling short is a technique used by a stockholder to take advantage of an anticipated decline in the price of a security 
in addition  holders of options and warrants will sometimes sell short knowing they can  in effect  cover through the exercise of an option or warrant  thus locking in a profit 
a significant number of short sales or a large volume of other sales within a relatively short period of time can create downward pressure on the market price of a security 
further sales of common stock issued upon exercise of our outstanding warrants could cause even greater declines in the price of our common stock due to the number of additional shares available in the market upon such exercise  which could encourage short sales that could further undermine the value of our common stock 
the economic downturn and the decline in the price of the company s publicly traded stock may result in further trademark impairment charges 
the company recorded goodwill and trademark impairment charges of million and million  respectively  in fiscal for  among other reasons  the economic downturn and the decline in the price of the company s publicly traded common stock 
should general economic  market or business conditions continue to decline and continue to have a negative impact on the company s stock price  the company may be required to record additional trademark impairment charges 
our anti takeover provisions may delay or prevent a change of control of us  which may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
certain provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change of control of us  which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
such provisions in the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend its charter documents  including stockholder supermajority voting requirements  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call a special meeting absent the request of the holders of a majority of the outstanding common stock  advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board of directors and for stockholder proposals  and the authority of its board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  blank check preferred stock 
the company is also afforded the protections of section of the delaware general corporation law which prevents it from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least of its common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock  unless board of directors or stockholder approval is obtained
