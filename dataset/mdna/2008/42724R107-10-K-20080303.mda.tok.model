these deposit accounts  which are closely monitored by bank management  had combined balances of million at december  compared to million at december  management and the board of directors of the bank are aware that changes in mortgage market conditions may continue to have an impact on these relationships 
in addition to the three accounts mentioned  the bank obtained two additional deposit relationships during the fourth quarter of that it considers to be volatile  at december   the combined balance of these accounts was approximately million 
in total  the bank has deposit relationships totaling approximately million that it considers to be of volatile nature at december  a more detailed discussion of deposits can be found under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
the principal sources of the company s consolidated revenues are i interest and fees on loans  ii interest on investments  iii service charges on deposit accounts and other charges and fees  iv mortgage origination fees and v miscellaneous income 
for the year ended december   these sources comprised    and  respectively  of the company s total operating income 
the company has not engaged in any material research activities relating to the development of new services or the improvement of existing bank services  except as otherwise discussed herein 
there has been no significant change in the types of services offered by the bank since its inception 
the company has no present plans regarding a new line of business requiring the investment of a material amount of total assets 
most of the company s business originates from san luis obispo and santa barbara counties and there is no emphasis on foreign sources and application of funds 
the company s business  based upon performance to date  does not appear to be seasonal 
management of the company is unaware of any material effect upon the company s capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position as a result of federal  state or local environmental regulations 
the bank holds service marks issued by the us patent and trademark office for the acorn design  the oakley design and deeply rooted in your hometown 
employees as of december   the bank had full time equivalent employees 
the bank believes that its employee relations are positive 
local economic climate the economy in the company s service area is based primarily on agriculture  tourism  light industry  oil and retail trade 
services supporting these industries have also developed in the areas of medical  financial and educational services 
the population of san luis obispo county  the city of santa maria in northern santa barbara county  and the city of santa barbara totaled approximately   and  respectively  according to economic data provided by local county and title company sources 
the moderate climate allows a year round growing season for numerous vegetable and fruits 
vineyards and cattle ranches also contribute largely to the local economy 
the central coast s leading agricultural industry is the production of high quality wine grapes and production of premium quality wines 
although on average the climate in our markets is generally very mild  we did experience significantly cooler weather in early this did not have a significant impact on our business 
vineyards in production have grown significantly over the past several years throughout the company s service area 
access to numerous recreational activities  including lakes  mountains and beaches  provide a relatively stable tourist industry from many areas including the los angeles orange county basin  the san francisco bay area and the san joaquin valley 
principally due to the diversity of the various industries in the company s service area  the area  while not immune from economic fluctuations  does tend to enjoy a more stable level of economic activity than many other areas of california 
throughout the primary market area of the company  the softening housing market of is expected to continue into  though it is unknown just how long lasting the slowdown might be 
the number of homes sold in was less than  according to real estate research firm dataquick 
the median price of an existing home in san luis obispo county was less in december compared to december some economists predict housing prices will moderate in based on the nontraditional nature of the market that includes buyers bringing in equity earned in other parts of the state 
because of the desirable climate  close proximity to pristine beaches  water sport lakes and the ever popular wine industry  for both san luis obispo and santa barbara county  the real estate market for single family residences has to a great degree depended on those buyers with greater amounts of discretionary funds who could afford a second home or a more expensive primary residence 
according to the chief economist for the california association of realtors  the central coast should fair better due to a somewhat constant demand for coastal property and the lack of over supply seen in many other parts of the state 
competition banking and the financial services business in california generally  and in the company s service area specifically  is highly competitive 
the increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation  changes in technology and product delivery systems  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers and the appearance of new banking organizations 
in order to compete with other financial institutions in its service area  the bank relies principally upon local advertising programs  direct personal contact by officers  directors  employees  and shareholders  and specialized services such as courier pick up and delivery of non cash banking items 
the bank emphasizes to customers the advantages of dealing with a locally owned and community oriented institution 
the bank also seeks to provide special services and programs for individuals in its primary service area who are employed in the agricultural  professional and business fields  such as loans for equipment  furniture  tools of the trade or expansion of practices or businesses 
larger banks may have a competitive advantage because of higher lending limits and major advertising and marketing campaigns 
they also perform services  such as trust services  international banking  discount brokerage and insurance services that the bank is not authorized or prepared to offer currently 
the bank has made arrangements with correspondent banks and with others to provide such services for its customers 
for borrowers requiring loans in excess of the bank s legal lending limits  the bank has offered  and intends to offer in the future  such loans on a participating basis with correspondent banks and with other independent banks  retaining the portion of such loans which is within its lending limit 
commercial banks compete with savings and loan associations  credit unions  other financial institutions  securities brokerage firms  and other entities for funds 
for instance  yields on corporate and government debt securities and other commercial paper affect the ability of commercial banks to attract and hold deposits 
commercial banks also compete for loans with savings and loan associations  credit unions  consumer finance companies  mortgage companies and other lending institutions 
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes involving frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services that have further increased competition 
there can also be no assurance that these technological improvements  if made  will increase the company s operational efficiency or that the company will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
effect of government policies and recent legislation banking is a business that depends on rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rate paid by the company on deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate received by the company on loans extended to its customers and securities held in the portfolio comprise the major portion of the company s earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the control of the company 
accordingly  the earnings and growth of the company are subject to the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions  including inflation  recession and unemployment 
the commercial banking business is not only affected by general economic conditions but is also influenced by the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and the policies of regulatory agencies  particularly the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board implements national monetary policies with objectives such as curbing inflation and combating recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements and by varying the discount rates applicable to borrowings by depository institutions 
the actions of the federal reserve board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature and impact on the company of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted 
from time to time  legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks  bank holding companies and other financial institutions are frequently made in congress  in the california legislature and before various bank regulatory and other professional agencies 
see supervision and regulation financial services modernization legislation and sarbanes oxley act of supervision and regulation general the company and the bank are extensively regulated under both federal and state law 
set forth below is a summary description of certain laws that relate to the regulation of the company and the bank 
the description does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations 
the company the company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of  as amended the bank holding company act  and is registered as such with  and subject to the supervision of  the federal reserve board 
the company is required to file with the federal reserve board quarterly and annual reports and such additional information as the federal reserve board may require pursuant to the bank holding company act 
the federal reserve board may conduct examinations of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries 
the company is required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve board before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank  or ownership or control of the voting shares of any bank if  after giving effect to such acquisition of shares  the company would own or control more than of the voting shares of such bank 
prior approval of the federal reserve board is also required for the merger or consolidation of the company and another bank holding company 
the company is prohibited by the bank holding company act  except in certain statutorily prescribed instances  from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the outstanding voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging  directly or indirectly  in activities other than those of banking  managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiaries 
however  the company may  subject to the prior approval of the federal reserve board  engage in any  or acquire shares of companies engaged in  activities that are deemed by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto 
see discussion under financial modernization act below for additional information 
the federal reserve board may require that the company terminate an activity or terminate control of or liquidate or divest subsidiaries or affiliates when the federal reserve board determines that the activity or the control or the subsidiary or affiliates constitutes a significant risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of any of its banking subsidiaries 
the federal reserve board also has the authority to regulate provisions of certain bank holding company debt  including authority to impose interest ceilings and reserve requirements on such debt 
under certain circumstances  the company must file written notice and obtain approval from the federal reserve board prior to purchasing or redeeming its equity securities 
under the federal reserve board s regulations  a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe and unsound manner 
in addition  it is the federal reserve board s policy that in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks  a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks 
a bank holding company s failure to meet its obligations to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks will generally be considered by the federal reserve board to be an unsafe and unsound banking practice or a violation of the federal reserve board s regulations or both 
the company and the bank are prohibited from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  sale or lease of property or furnishing of services 
for example  with certain exceptions  neither the company nor the bank may condition an extension of credit to a customer on either a requirement that the customer obtain additional services provided by us or an agreement by the customer to refrain from obtaining other services from a competitor 
the company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and files reports and proxy statements pursuant to such act with the securities and exchange commission the sec the bank the bank is chartered under the laws of the state of california and its deposits are insured by the fdic to the extent provided by law 
the bank is subject to the supervision of  and is regularly examined by  the dfi and the fdic 
for the bank  such supervision and regulation includes comprehensive reviews of all major aspects of the bank s business and condition 
various requirements and restrictions under the laws of the united states and the state of california affect the operations of the bank 
federal and california statutes relate to many aspects of the bank s operations  including reserves against deposits  interest rates payable on deposits  loans  investments  mergers and acquisitions  borrowings  dividends and locations of branch offices 
further  the bank is required to maintain certain levels of capital 
if  as a result of an examination of a bank  the fdic or the dfi should determine that the financial condition  capital resources  asset quality  earnings prospects  management  liquidity  or other aspects of a bank s operations are unsatisfactory or that a bank or its respective management is violating or has violated any law or regulation  various remedies are available to these regulatory agencies 
such remedies include the power to enjoin unsafe or unsound practices  to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice  to issue an administrative order that can be judicially enforced  to direct an increase in capital  to restrict growth  to assess civil monetary penalties  to remove officers and directors  and ultimately to terminate deposit insurance  which for a california chartered bank would result in a revocation of the bank s charter 
capital standards the federal reserve board and the fdic have adopted risk based minimum capital guidelines intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets and transactions  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under these guidelines  nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us treasury securities  to for assets with relatively high credit risk  such as business loans 
a banking organization s risk based capital ratios are obtained by dividing its qualifying capital by its total risk adjusted assets 
the regulators measure risk adjusted assets  which includes off balance sheet items  against both total qualifying capital the sum of tier i capital and limited amounts of tier ii capital and tier i capital 
tier i capital consists primarily of common stock  retained earnings  non cumulative perpetual preferred stock cumulative perpetual preferred stock for bank holding companies and minority interests in certain subsidiaries  less most intangible assets 
tier ii capital may consist of a limited amount of the allowance for possible loan and lease losses  cumulative preferred stock  long term preferred stock  eligible term subordinated debt and certain other instruments with some characteristics of equity 
the inclusion of elements of tier ii capital is subject to certain other requirements and limitations of the federal banking agencies 
the federal banking agencies require a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier i capital to risk adjusted assets of 
in addition to the risk based guidelines  federal banking regulators require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier i capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations  the minimum leverage ratio of tier i capital to total assets is 
for all banking organizations not rated in the highest category  the minimum leverage ratio must be at least 
in addition to these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry  the regulators have the discretion to set individual minimum capital requirements for specific institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios 
future changes in regulations or practices could further reduce the amount of capital recognized for purposes of capital adequacy 
such a change could affect the ability of the company to grow and could restrict the amount of profits  if any  available for the payment of dividends 
the regulatory capital requirements  as well as the actual capital ratios for heritage oaks bank and the company as of december   are presented in detail in note  regulatory matters of the consolidated financial statements 
see also capital within management s discussion and analysis of this form k 
as of december   both the bank and the company exceeded the minimum capital requirements to be well capitalized 
under applicable regulatory guidelines  the company s trust preferred securities issued by our subsidiary capital trusts qualify as tier i capital up to a maximum limit of of total tier i capital 
any additional portion of the trust preferred securities would qualify as tier ii capital 
as of december   the subsidiary trusts had million in trust preferred securities outstanding  of which million qualify as tier i capital 
in addition  the dfi has authority to take possession of the business and properties of a bank in the event that the tangible shareholders equity of a bank is less than the greater of i of the banks total assets or ii  prompt corrective action and other enforcement mechanisms federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action to resolve the problems of insured depository institutions  including but not limited to those institutions that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios described above 
an institution that  based upon its capital levels  is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or an unsafe or unsound practice warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions 
the federal banking agencies  however  may not treat a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized unless its capital ratio actually warrants such treatment 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  commercial banking organizations may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation  or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions may include the imposition of a conservator or receiver or the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced  the termination of insurance of deposits in the case of a depository institution  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  the issuance of formal and informal agreements  the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties  and  the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the agency would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted 
additionally  a holding company s inability to serve as a source of strength to its subsidiary banking organizations could serve as an additional basis for a regulatory action against the holding company 
banks are also subject to certain federal reserve board restrictions on extensions of credit to executive officers  directors  principal shareholders or any related interests of such persons ie  insiders 
extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms and pursuant to the same credit underwriting procedures as those for comparable transactions with persons who are neither insiders nor employees  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to insiders 
a violation of these restrictions may result in regulatory sanctions on the bank or its insiders 
safety and soundness standards the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia imposes certain specific restrictions on transactions and requires federal banking regulators to adopt overall safety and soundness standards for depository institutions related to internal control  loan underwriting and documentation and asset growth 
among other things  fdicia limits the interest rates paid on deposits by undercapitalized institutions  restricts the use of brokered deposits  limits the aggregate extensions of credit by a depository institution to an executive officer  director  principal shareholder or related interest  and reduces deposit insurance coverage for deposits offered by undercapitalized institutions for deposits by certain employee benefits accounts 
the federal banking agencies may require an institution to submit to an acceptable compliance plan as well as have the flexibility to pursue other more appropriate or effective courses of action given the specific circumstances and severity of an institution s noncompliance with one or more standards 
premiums for deposit insurance the bank s deposits are currently insured to a maximum of  per depositor by the fdic except for certain retirement accounts which are insured up to  the bank is required to pay deposit insurance premiums 
the premium amount is based upon a risk classification system established by the fdic 
banks with higher levels of capital and a low degree of supervisory concern are assessed lower premiums than banks with lower levels of capital or a higher degree of supervisory concern 
effective january  the fdic adopted a new rule for the insurance assessment on deposits 
under the new rule the charge for annual insurance deposit assessments will range from a minimum of basis points to a maximum of basis points per of insured deposits depending upon the risk assessment category into which the institution falls 
insured institutions are not all allowed to disclose their risk assessment classification and no assurance can be given as to what the future level of premiums will be 
under the federal deposit insurance reform act of  the bank received a one time initial assessment credit to recognize its past contributions to the insurance fund 
the bank s one time assessment credit was approximately thousand 
this credit can be used to offset assessments until exhausted 
during  the bank used the entire amount of the credit as an offset to its regular quarterly assessment 
in addition to the assessment for deposit insurance  institutions are required to make payments on bonds issued in the late s by the financing corporation to recapitalize a predecessor deposit insurance fund 
this payment is established quarterly and during the year ending december  averaged basis points of assessable deposits 
the fdic has authority to increase insurance assessments 
a significant increase in insurance premiums could have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the company 
management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future 
the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution s regulatory agency 
sarbanes oxley act of on july   the sarbanes oxley act of sox  was signed into law to address corporate and accounting fraud 
sox establishes a new accounting oversight board that will enforce auditing standards and restricts the scope of services that accounting firms may provide to their public company audit clients 
among other things  sox also i requires chief executive officers and chief financial officers to certify to the accuracy of periodic reports filed with the sec  ii imposes new disclosure requirements regarding internal controls  off balance sheet transactions  and pro forma non gaap disclosures  iii accelerates the time frame for reporting of insider transactions and periodic disclosures by public companies  and iv requires companies to disclose whether or not they have adopted a code of ethics for senior financial officers and whether the audit committee includes at least one audit committee financial expert 
under sox  the sec is required to regularly and systematically review corporate filings  based on certain enumerated factors 
to deter wrongdoing  sox i subjects bonuses issued to top executives to disgorgement if a restatement of a company s financial statements was due to corporate misconduct  ii prohibits an officer or director from misleading or coercing an auditor  iii prohibits insider trades during pension fund blackout periods  iv imposes new criminal penalties for fraud and other wrongful acts  and v extends the period during which certain securities fraud lawsuits can be brought against a company or its officers 
as a public reporting company  the company is subject to the requirements of sox and related rules and regulations issued by the sec and nasdaq 
it is anticipated that the company will incur additional expense as a result of the act  but we do not expect that such compliance will have a material impact on our business 
financial services modernization legislation on november   the gramm leach bliley act of the financial services modernization act was signed into law 
the financial services modernization act is intended to modernize the banking industry by removing barriers to affiliation among banks  insurance companies  the securities industry and other financial service providers 
it provides financial organizations with the flexibility of structuring such affiliations through a holding company structure or through a financial subsidiary of a bank  subject to certain limitations 
the financial services modernization act establishes a new type of bank holding company  known as a financial holding company  which may engage in an expanded list of activities that are financial in nature  which include securities and insurance brokerage  securities underwriting  insurance underwriting and merchant banking 
the company has not sought financial holding company status and has no present plans to do so 
the financial services modernization act also sets forth a system of functional regulation that makes the federal reserve board the umbrella supervisor for holding companies  while providing for the supervision of the holding company s subsidiaries by other federal and state agencies 
in addition  the bank is subject to other provisions of the financial services modernization act  including those relating to cra  privacy and safe guarding confidential customer information  regardless of whether the company elects to become a financial holding company or to conduct activities through a financial subsidiary of the bank 
the company does not  however  currently intend to file notice with the federal reserve board to become a financial holding company or to engage in expanded financial activities through a financial subsidiary of the bank 
the company and the bank do not believe that the financial services modernization act will have a material adverse effect on their operations in the near term 
however  to the extent that it permits banks  securities firms  and insurance companies to affiliate  the financial services industry may experience further consolidation 
the financial services modernization act is intended to grant to community banks certain powers as a matter of right that larger institutions have accumulated on an ad hoc basis 
nevertheless  this act may have the result of increasing the amount of competition that the company faces from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products  many of which may have substantially more financial resources than the company 
usa patriot act of on october   president bush signed the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism  or the patriot act  of among other things  the patriot act i prohibits banks from providing correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks  ii imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening or holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign individuals iii requires financial institutions to establish an anti money laundering compliance program  and iv eliminates civil liability for persons who file suspicious activity reports 
the patriot act also increases governmental powers to investigate terrorism  including expanded government access to account records and make rules to implement the patriot act 
on march   the president signed the usa patriot improvement and reauthorization act  which extended and modified the original act 
while we believe the patriot act  as amended and reauthorized  may  to some degree  affect our recordkeeping and reporting expenses  we do not believe that it will have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
transactions between affiliates transactions between a bank and its affiliates are quantitatively and qualitatively restricted under the federal reserve act 
the federal reserve board issued regulation w on october   which comprehensively implements sections a and b of the federal reserve act 
sections a and b and regulation w restrict loans by a depository institution to its affiliates  asset purchases by a depository institution from its affiliates  and other transactions between a depository institution and its affiliates 
regulation w unifies in one public document the federal reserve board s interpretations of section a and b 
regulation w had an effective date of april  community reinvestment act the bank is subject to certain fair lending requirements and reporting obligations involving home mortgage lending operations and community reinvestment act cra activities 
the cra generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of their local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
in addition to substantial penalties and corrective measures that may be required for a violation of certain fair lending laws  the federal banking agencies may take compliance with such laws and cra into account when regulating and supervising other activities 
when a bank holding company applies for approval to acquire a bank or other bank holding company  the federal reserve board will review the assessment of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company  and such records may be the basis for denying the application 
a bank s compliance with its cra obligations is based on a performance based evaluation system which bases cra ratings on an institution s lending service and investment performance  resulting in a rating by the appropriate bank regulatory agency of outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve or substantial noncompliance 
at its last examination by the fdic  the bank received a cra rating of satisfactory 
privacy federal banking rules limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non public information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
pursuant to these rules  financial institutions must provide initial notices to customers about their privacy policies  describing the conditions under which they may disclose non public information to nonaffiliated third parties and affiliates  annual notices of their privacy policies to current customers  and a reasonable method for customers to opt out of disclosures to nonaffiliated third parties 
these privacy provisions affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors 
we have implemented our privacy policies in accordance with the law 
in recent years  a number of states have implemented their own versions of privacy laws 
for example  in  california adopted standards that are more restrictive than federal law  allowing bank customers the opportunity to bar financial companies from sharing information with their affiliates 
predatory lending the term predatory lending  much like the terms safety and soundness and unfair and deceptive practices  is far reaching and covers a potentially broad range of behavior 
as such  it does not lend itself to a concise or a comprehensive definition 
but typically predatory lending involves at least one  and perhaps all three  of the following elements making unaffordable loans based on the assets of the borrower rather than on the borrower s ability to repay an obligation  or asset based lending  inducing a borrower to refinance a loan repeatedly in order to charge high points and fees each time the loan is refinanced  or loan flipping  and engaging in fraud or deception to conceal the true nature of the loan obligation from an unsuspecting or unsophisticated borrower 
federal reserve board regulations aimed at curbing such lending significantly widened the pool of high cost home secured loans covered by the home ownership and equity protection act of  a federal law that requires extra disclosures and consumer protections to borrowers 
the following triggers coverage under the home ownership and equity protection act of interest rates for first lien mortgage loans in excess of percentage points above comparable treasury securities  subordinate lien loans of percentage points above treasury securities  and fees such as optional insurance and similar debt protection costs paid in connection with the credit transaction  when combined with points and fees if deemed excessive 
in addition  the regulation bars loan flipping by the same lender or loan servicer within a year 
lenders also will be presumed to have violated the law which says loans shouldn t be made to people unable to repay them unless they document that the borrower has the ability to repay 
lenders that violate the rules face cancellation of loans and penalties equal to the finance charges paid 
the company does not expect these rules and potential state action in this area to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
bank secrecy act and money laundering control act in  congress passed the currency and foreign transactions reporting act  otherwise known as the bank secrecy act the bsa  which established requirements for recordkeeping and reporting by banks and other financial institutions 
the bsa was designed to help identify the source  volume and movement of currency and other monetary instruments into and out of the united states in order to help detect and prevent money laundering connected with drug trafficking  terrorism and other criminal activities 
the primary tool used to implement bsa requirements is the filing of suspicious activity reports 
today  the bsa requires that all banking institutions develop and provide for the continued administration of a program reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements regarding both domestic and international currency transactions 
these programs must  at a minimum  provide for a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance  provide for independent testing of such systems and compliance  designate individuals responsible for such compliance and provide appropriate personnel training

item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes may affect our business are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our business 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations 
this annual report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of our common stock could decline significantly  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks associated with our business we are highly dependent on real estate and a downturn in the real estate market may hurt our business 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on real estate 
at december   real estate served as the principal source of collateral with respect to approximately of our loan portfolio 
a decline in current economic conditions  a decline in the local housing market  such as the one we are experiencing currently  or rising interest rates could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans  the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  the value of real estate and other collateral securing loans and the value of real estate owned by us  as well as our financial condition and results of operations in general and the market value of our common stock 
acts of nature  including earthquakes  floods and fires  which may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures these loans  may also negatively impact our financial condition 
we also have a concentration in higher risk commercial real estate loans 
we also have a high concentration in commercial real estate or cre loans 
cre loans as defined by final guidance issued by bank regulators are defined as construction  land development  other land loans  loans secured by multifamily or more residential properties  and loans secured by non farm nonresidential properties 
following this definition  approximately of our lending portfolio can be classified as cre lending 
cre loans generally involve a higher degree of credit risk than residential mortgage lending due  among other things  to the large amounts loaned to individual borrowers 
losses incurred on loans to a small number of borrowers could have a material adverse impact on our income and financial condition 
in addition  unlike residential mortgage loans  commercial real estate loans generally depend on the cash flow from the property to service the debt 
cash flow may be significantly affected by general economic conditions 
additionally  federal banking regulators recently issued final guidance regarding commercial real estate lending 
this guidance suggests that institutions that are potentially exposed to significant commercial real estate concentration risk will be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny 
institutions that have experienced rapid growth in commercial real estate lending  have notable exposure to a specific type of commercial real estate lending  or are approaching or exceed certain supervisory criteria that measure an institution s commercial real estate portfolio against its capital levels  may be subject to such increased regulatory scrutiny 
our commercial real estate portfolio may be viewed as falling within one or more of the foregoing categories  and accordingly we may become subject to increased regulatory scrutiny because of our commercial real estate portfolio 
if it is determined by our regulator that we have an undue concentration in commercial real estate lending  we may be required to maintain increased levels of capital and or be required to reduce our concentration in commercial real estate loans 
the current changing economic environment poses significant challenges for us 
we are operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment  including generally uncertain national and local conditions 
financial institutions continue to be affected by the softening of the real estate market and constrained financial markets 
while we have very limited direct exposure to the residential real estate market and while we have no sub prime residential loans or securities backed by such loans on our books  we are nevertheless affected by these events 
continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment  including job losses  interest rate resets on adjustable rate mortgage loans and other factors could have adverse effects on our borrowers which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
this deterioration in economic conditions coupled with a possible national economic recession could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in our allowance for loan losses and result in the following other consequences loan delinquencies  problem assets and foreclosures may increase  demand for our products and services may decline  low cost or non interest bearing deposits may decrease  and collateral for our loans  especially real estate  may decline in value  in turn reducing customers borrowing power  and reducing the value of assets and collateral associate with our existing loans 
our real estate lending also exposes us to the risk of environmental liabilities 
in the course of our business  we may foreclose and take title to real estate  and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third persons for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination  or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances  or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  as the owner or former owner of a contaminated site  we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
if we ever become subject to significant environmental liabilities  our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our business is subject to interest rate risk and changes in interest rates may adversely affect our performance and financial condition 
our earnings are impacted by changing interest rates 
changes in interest rates impact the demand for new loans  the credit profile of our borrowers  the rates received on loans and securities and rates paid on deposits and borrowings 
the difference between the rates received on loans and securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings is known as interest rate spread 
given our current volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  we would expect our interest rate spread to increase if interest rates rise and  conversely  to decline if interest rates fall 
increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services business may decrease our net interest margin by forcing us to offer lower lending interest rates and pay higher deposit interest rates 
although we believe our current level of interest rate sensitivity is reasonable  significant fluctuations in interest rates and increasing competition may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a sustained decrease in market interest rates could adversely affect our earnings 
when interest rates decline  borrowers tend to refinance higher rate  fixed rate loans at lower rates  prepaying their existing loans 
under those circumstances  we would not be able to reinvest those prepayments in assets earning interest rates as high as the rates on the prepaid loans 
in addition  our commercial real estate and commercial loans  which carry interest rates that  in general  adjust in accordance with changes in the prime rate  will adjust to lower rates 
we are also significantly affected by the level of loan demand available in our market 
the inability to make sufficient loans directly affects the interest income we earn 
lower loan demand will generally result in lower interest income realized as we place funds in lower yielding investments 
failure to successfully execute our strategy may adversely affect our performance 
our financial performance and profitability depends on our ability to execute our corporate growth strategy 
continued growth  however  may present operating and other problems that could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to execute our growth strategy or maintain the level of profitability that we have recently experienced 
factors that may adversely affect our ability to attain our long term financial performance goals include those stated elsewhere in this section  as well as inability to control non interest expense  including  but not limited to  rising employee  regulatory compliance  and healthcare costs  inability to increase non interest income  and continuing ability to expand  through de novo branching or finding acquisition targets at valuation levels we find attractive 
economic conditions in the central coast of california area may adversely affect our operations and or cause us to sustain losses 
our retail and commercial banking operations are concentrated primarily in san luis obispo and santa barbara counties 
as a result of this geographic concentration  our results of operations depend largely upon economic conditions in this area 
a significant source of risk arises from the possibility that losses will be sustained if a significant number of our borrowers  guarantors and related parties fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
this risk increases when the economy is weak 
we have adopted underwriting and credit monitoring procedures and credit policies  including the establishment and review of the allowance for credit losses  that management believes is appropriate to minimize this risk by assessing the likelihood of nonperformance  tracking loan performance and diversifying our credit portfolio 
these policies and procedures  however  may not prevent unexpected losses that could materially adversely affect our results of operations in general and the market value of our stock 
our primary market area is an increasingly competitive and overcrowded banking market 
our ability to achieve the growth outlined in our corporate strategic goals may be dependent in part on an ability to grow through the successful addition of new branches or the identification and acquisition of potential targets at acceptable pricing levels either inside or outside of our primary market 
if we are unable to attract significant new business through strategic branching  or acquire new business through our acquisition of other banks  our growth in loans and deposits and  therefore  our earnings  may be adversely affected 
we face strong competition from financial service companies and other companies that offer banking services which may hurt our business 
the financial services business in our market areas is highly competitive 
it is becoming increasingly competitive due to changes in regulation  technological advances  and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial services providers 
we face competition both in attracting quality assets and deposits and in making loans 
we compete for loans principally through the interest rates and loan fees we charge and the efficiency and quality of services we provide 
increasing levels of competition in the banking and financial services business may reduce our market share  decrease loan demand  cause the prices we charge for our services to fall  or decrease our net interest margin by forcing us to offer lower lending interest rates and pay higher deposit interest rates 
therefore  our results may differ in future periods depending upon the nature or level of competition 
technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods 
for example  consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds 
consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries  known as disintermediation  could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits 
the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most of our activities can be intense and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills  knowledge of our market  years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 
our internal operations are subject to a number of risks 
we are subject to certain operations risks  including  but not limited to  data processing system failures and errors  customer or employee fraud and catastrophic failures resulting from terrorist acts or natural disasters 
we maintain a system of internal controls to mitigate against such occurrences and maintain insurance coverage for such risks that are insurable  but should such an event occur that is not prevented or detected by our internal controls  uninsured or in excess of applicable insurance limits  it could have a significant adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
information systems we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that any such failures  interruptions or security breaches will not occur or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
technological advances the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external events severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business 
such events could affect the stability of our deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue and or cause us to incur additional expenses 
for example  the central coast of california is subject to earthquakes and fires 
operations in our market could be disrupted by both the evacuation of large portions of the population as well as damage and or lack of access to our banking and operation facilities 
while we have not experienced such an occurrence to date  other severe weather or natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events may occur in the future 
although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures  the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on cash dividends from our subsidiary bank to meet our cash obligations as a holding company  dividends from our subsidiary bank provide a substantial portion of our cash flow used to service the interest payments on our trust preferred securities and our other obligations  including cash dividends 
see item market for common equity and related stockholder matters 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends our subsidiary bank can pay to us without regulatory approval 
our recent acquisition of business first national bank presents certain risks to our operations 
there are risks commonly encountered with growth through acquisition of banks 
these risks include  among other things difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired bank and its branches  potential disruption of our ongoing business  inability of our management to maximize our financial and strategic position by the successful implementation of uniform product offerings and the incorporation of uniform technology into our product offerings and control systems  and inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of changes in management 
while we believe the integration of business first national bank is going well  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with this acquisition 
our inability to improve the operating performance of business first national bank or to integrate its operations successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  we have incurred and will continue to incur substantial expenses  including the expenses of integrating the operations of business first national bank with our existing business 
risks associated with our industry we are subject to government regulation that may limit or restrict our activities  which in turn may adversely impact our operations 
the financial services industry is regulated extensively 
federal and state regulation is designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers  and not to benefit our shareholders 
these regulations can sometimes impose significant limitations on our operations 
new laws and regulations or changes in existing laws and regulations or repeal of existing laws and regulations may adversely impact our business 
for example  operating expenses of approximately thousand were attributable to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act provisions in the year ended december  we anticipate that continued compliance with  among other regulatory provisions  the sarbanes oxley act will impact future operating expenses 
further  federal monetary policy  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  significantly affects economic conditions for us 
new legislative and regulatory proposals may affect our operations and growth 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of  and federal insurance premiums paid by  banks and other financial institutions and companies that control such institutions are frequently raised in the us congress  state legislatures and before bank regulatory authorities 
the likelihood of any major changes in the future and the impact such changes might have on us or our subsidiaries are impossible to determine 
similarly  proposals to change the accounting treatment applicable to banks and other depository institutions are frequently raised by the sec  the federal banking agencies  the irs and other appropriate authorities 
the likelihood and impact of any additional future changes in law or regulation and the impact such changes might have on us or our subsidiaries are impossible to determine at this time 
risks associated with our stock our stock trades less frequently than others 
although our common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq capital market  the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
given the lower trading volume of our common stock  significant sales of our common stock  or the expectation of these sales  could cause our stock price to fall 
our stock price is affected by a variety of factors 
stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive 
our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors discussed in this section  including  among other things actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations 
recommendations by securities analysts 
operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to our company 
news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry 
perceptions in the marketplace regarding our company and or its competitors 
our common stock is not an insured deposit 
our common stock is not a bank deposit and  therefore  is not insured against loss by the fdic  any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity 
investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company 
as a result  if you acquire our common stock  you may lose some or all of your investment 
our articles of incorporation and by laws  as well as certain banking laws  may have an anti takeover effect 
provisions of our articles of incorporation  bylaws and federal banking laws  including regulatory approval requirements  could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be perceived to be beneficial to our shareholders 
the combination of these provisions may hinder a non negotiated merger or other business combination  which  in turn  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock

refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on junior subordinated debenture limitations on dividends

the primary factor behind the year over year increase in net income was an million or increase in interest income  resulting from the company s continued loan growth  rising interest rates during the first half of  and the acquisition of business first 
since the acquisition  business first has contributed approximately million in interest income to the bank 
although the bank did experience a significant amount of loan pay downs during the year  the dollar amount of loans funded rose significantly from the prior year end  contributing the overall rise in organic loan growth and ultimately interest income 
during  the company experienced a significant rise in interest expense  which minimized the rise in net interest income 
for the years ended december   and interest expense was million  million and million  respectively 
for  on a year over year basis  interest expense grew approximately million or 
this increase can be attributed to the considerable deposit growth the bank experienced during  specifically related to promotions designed to attract lower cost core deposits as well as rising interest rates during the first half of the growth in lower cost core deposits has  however  allowed the bank to pay down more expensive federal home loan bank borrowings in an effort to curb the rise in the bank s overall cost of funds 
additionally  of the rise in interest expense approximately million or can be attributed to the acquisition of business first 
the rise in interest expense during has placed pressure on the net interest margin 
the company s net interest margin declined approximately basis points in to from in and approximately basis points from the reported in competition for lower cost core deposits and rising interest rates during the majority of were primary factors in the year over year decline in the net interest margin 
the company also experienced a million or rise in non interest expense during for the years ended december   and non interest expense was million  million and million  respectively 
for  the year over year rise in non interest expenses is mainly attributable to a million or rise in salaries and employee benefits 
the increase in this category can be attributed in part to a full year impact of the templeton branch opened in august as well as the addition of staff for a full service branch in the town of san miguel that has since opened in early additionally  the acquisition of business first accounted for approximately million or of the rise in salaries and employee benefits on a year over year basis 
for the company s efficiency ratio was 
this is slightly higher than the and the company reported for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the rise in the efficiency ratio can be attributed to the addition of staff needed to position the company for future growth  the acquisition of business first  and the rise in interest expense during  as previously mentioned 
return on equity roe was  and for  and  respectively 
in addition to the rise in interest and non interest expenses  the acquisition of business first has placed some pressure on roe during the later half of due to the issuance of common stock to the former shareholders of business first in connection with the acquisition 
at december   the company had approximately million in total assets 
this  when compared to the million reported at december   represents an increase of approximately million or 
of this increase  approximately million can be attributed to the acquisition of and growth in business first assets 
during  the increase in net loan balances contributed to the majority of the rise in total assets 
excluding the acquisition of business first  the bank s loan portfolio grew approximately million or 
in october  the bank acquired approximately million in net loans from business first and since the date of the acquisition  business first net loan balances have increased approximately million or 
the growth in the bank s deposit balances have contributed to higher balances in federal funds sold 
at december   federal funds sold were approximately million  which represents an approximate million increase over the million reported at december  at december   total deposits were million 
this  when compared to the million reported at december   represents an increase of approximately million 
during  the bank engaged in promotions designed to attract lower cost core deposits in an effort to fund the strong loan growth the bank saw during the first half of the year  and to pay down higher cost federal home loan bank borrowings 
these promotions have proven to be successful  as the bank  excluding the acquisition of business first experienced an increase in total deposits of approximately million or during the majority of this increase can be attributed to a million increase in savings  now and money market deposit balances 
upon the acquisition of business first  the bank acquired approximately million in deposits 
as previously mentioned  the strong growth in lower cost core deposit balances during allowed the bank to pay down approximately million in higher cost federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings 
at december   the bank had million in fhlb advances  which were assumed upon the acquisition of business first

each of the four leases provide for an initial term of years with the option to renew for two year terms 
in connection with the sale of the properties mentioned  the bank will recognize a gain of approximately million 
this gain will be amortized over a fifteen year period in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for leases 
in addition to deferring the gain on sale  the bank has recorded an income tax liability and a deferred tax asset in the approximate amounts of million  directly related to the deferred gain on sale 
for the year ended december   the company recognized a gain of approximately million related to the sale leaseback transaction  which was recorded as an offset to rental expense 
see also item description of properties of this form k for additional information related to this transaction

basic earnings per share were  and at december   and  respectively 
diluted earnings per share were  and at december   and  respectively 
earnings were mostly unchanged from the prior year primarily due to an increase in interest expense on interest bearing accounts and borrowed funds along with an increase in non interest expenses 
rising interest rates during the majority of as well as competition for lower cost core deposits contributed to a basis point rise in the company s cost of funds  which placed pressure on and resulted in a reduction in the net interest margin from in to in net interest income and margin net interest income  the primary component of the net earnings of a financial institution  refers to the difference between the interest paid on deposits and borrowings  and the interest earned on loans and investments

provision and allowance for loan losses an allowance for loan losses has been established by management to provide for those loans that may not be repaid in their entirety for a variety of reasons 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered by management to be adequate to provide for probable incurred losses 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged to earnings and is reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan losses is based upon past loan loss experience and management s evaluation of the loan portfolio under current economic conditions 
loans are charged to the allowance for loan losses when  and to the extent  they are deemed by management to be un collectible 
the allowance for loan losses is composed of allocations for specific loans and a historical portion for all other loans 
the bank recognizes that credit losses will be experienced and the risk of loss will vary with  among other things  general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and in the case of a collateralized loan  the quality of the collateral for such loan 
the allowance for loan losses represents the bank s estimate of the allowance necessary to provide for probable incurred losses in the portfolio 
in making this determination  the bank analyzes the ultimate collectibility of the loans in the portfolios by incorporating feedback provided by internal loan staff  an independent loan review function  and information provided by examinations performed by regulatory agencies 
the bank makes monthly evaluations as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses

 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
these pronouncements provide that when it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due in accordance with the terms of the loan that such loan is deemed impaired 
impaired loans are accounted for differently in that the amount of the impairment is measured and reflected in the records of the creditor 
the allowance for credit losses related to loans that are identified for evaluation in accordance with sfas no 
is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
the general portfolio allocation consists of an assigned reserve percentage based on the credit rating of the loan 
the subjective portion is determined based on loan history and the banks evaluation of various factors including current economic conditions and trends in the portfolio including delinquencies and impairment  as well as changes in the composition of the portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed monthly by the bank s director s  loan committee and full board of directors  and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  a corresponding increase or decrease is made in the provision for loan losses 
the methodology used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses for the year is consistent with prior periods 
the bank s provision for loan losses was thousand  thousand and thousand for  and  respectively

summary of market condition the local residential real estate market came under significant pressure during and was negatively impacted by rising interest rates during the majority of the year as well as negative sentiment surrounding market values of real estate 
additionally  as more and more home owners began to see interest rate resets on adjustable rate mortgages  the number of non performing loans and defaults began to rise in the industry as a whole 
these effects were primarily felt by residential mortgage lenders  which is not the focus of the bank 
these factors eventually led to the tightening of credit and a downturn in real estate markets 
although sales of single family homes have significantly fallen year over year in the company s market area  prices have only experienced a modest decline 
additionally  the bank saw construction loan demand for both single family and commercial real estate moderate during although the lending environment has become more challenging  commercial real estate prices in the company s market area remained relatively unchanged from the prior year even with slowing sales 
the demand for business and professional properties in the company s market area remained strong during  with relatively low vacancies  competitive loan rates  and many investors seeking exchange properties 
capitalization rates  the rate at which a stream of cash flows are discounted to find their present value  for the last three years were to in  to in  and to in the company continues to believe that the desirability of the area as well as the diversity of the loan portfolio will provide some insulation against a slowdown in growth

annually  the loan portfolio is also reviewed by an experienced  outside loan reviewer not affiliated with the bank 
a list of delinquencies  the watch list  loan grades and the outside loan review are reviewed regularly by the bank s board of directors 
the bank has a non accrual policy that requires a loan greater than days past due and or is specifically determined to be impaired to be placed on non accrual status unless such loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection 
when loans are placed on non accrual status  all uncollected interest accrued is reversed from earnings 
once on non accrual status  interest on a loan is only recognized on a cash basis and is generally is not recognized on specific impaired loans unless the likelihood of further loss is remote 
interest payments received on such loans are applied as a reduction of the loan principal balance 
loans may be returned to accrual status if management believes that all remaining principal and interest is fully collectible and there has been at least six months of sustained repayment performance since the loan was placed on non accrual 
loans on non accrual status totaled thousand and thousand at december  and  respectively 
at december   non performing loans consisted of four loans  of which  one for approximately thousand that is real estate secured has a loan to value ltv of approximately and is current  two loans that are less than thousand each and are paying as agreed  and one less than thousand that is in the process of collection

while credit quality is consistently monitored  management has implemented additional precautionary actions that include but are not limited to pro actively identifying credit weaknesses earlier in the collection cycle  increasing the oversight frequency of watch list credits and devoting additional internal resources to monitoring watch list credits 
while there is no guarantee that the bank will not experience an increase in non performing loans  historically the bank has been able to work through impaired credits with minimal net charge off history 
if a loan s credit quality deteriorates to the point that collection of principal is believed by management to be doubtful and the value of collateral securing the obligation is sufficient the bank generally takes steps to protect and liquidate the collateral 
any loss resulting from the difference between the loan balance and the fair market value of the property is recognized by a charge to the reserve for loan losses 
when the property is held for sale after foreclosure  it is subject to a periodic appraisal 
if the appraisal indicates that the property will sell for less than its recorded value  the bank recognizes the loss by a charge to non interest expense

capital ratios for commercial banks in the united states are generally calculated using three different formulas 
these calculations are referred to as the leverage ratio and two risk based calculations known as tier one risk based capital ratio and the total risk based capital ratio 
these standards were developed through joint efforts of banking authorities from different countries around the world 
the standards essentially take into account the fact that different types of assets have different levels of risk associated with them 
furthermore  they take into account the off balance sheet exposures of banks when assessing capital adequacy 
the leverage ratio calculation simply divides common stockholders equity reduced by any goodwill a bank may have by the total assets of the bank 
in the tier one risk based capital ratio  the numerator is the same as the leverage ratio  but the denominator is the total risk weighted assets of the bank 
risk weighted assets are determined by segregating all the assets and off balance sheet exposures into different risk categories and weighting them by a percentage ranging from lowest risk to highest risk 
the total risk based capital ratio  again  uses risk weighted assets in the denominator  but expands the numerator to include other capital items besides equity such as a limited amount of the loan loss reserve  long term capital debt  preferred stock and other instruments 
summarized below are the company s and the bank s capital ratios at december  minimum regulatory capital requirements heritage oaks bancorp heritage oaks bank leverage ratio tier i risk weighted total risk based liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the continuous availability of funds to meet the demands of depositors  investors and borrowers 
asset liquidity is primarily derived from loan payments and the maturity of other earning assets 
liquidity from liabilities is obtained primarily from the receipt of new deposits 
the bank s asset liability committee alco is responsible for managing the on and off balance sheet commitments to meet the needs of customers while achieving the bank s financial objectives 
alco meets regularly to assess the projected funding requirements by reviewing historical funding patterns  current and forecasted economic conditions and individual customer funding needs 
deposits generated from the bank s customers serve as the primary source of liquidity 
the bank has credit arrangements with correspondent banks that serve as a secondary liquidity source 
at december   these credit lines totaled million and the bank had no borrowings against those lines 
the bank is a member of the fhlb and has collateralized borrowing capacities remaining of million at december  the bank manages liquidity by maintaining a majority of the investment portfolio in federal funds sold and other liquid investments 
at december   the ratio of liquid assets not pledged for collateral and other purposes to deposits and other liabilities was compared to in the ratio of net loans to deposits ltd  another key liquidity ratio  was at december  compared to at december  both of which are and were within the bank s policy guidelines 
while the bank still provides the majority of loan funding with core deposits  due to the highly competitive nature of deposit gathering the bank has found it necessary to rely on borrowed funds from time to time 
with the banking industry s common use of alternative funding sources  ie fhlb borrowing  in the bank implemented a tracking ratio of loan to funding ltf 
this ratio is calculated by dividing gross loans by the sum of total deposits and alternative funding sources both available and used 
at december  and  the ltf ratio was and 
the bank s key focus has been and remains to increase core deposits and minimize alternative funding sources 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
accounting policies are described in detail in note of the consolidated financial statements filed on this form k 
our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses represents management s best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is increased by the provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors reviews and evaluation of individual loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry groups  historical loan loss experiences and the level of classified and nonperforming loans 
loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses assumptions and methodologies consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  historical loss experience and the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the associated provision for loan and lease losses 
securities available for sale the fair value of most securities that are designated available for sale are based on quoted market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are extrapolated from the quoted prices of similar instruments 
goodwill and other intangible assets as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  we assess goodwill and other intangible assets each year for impairment 
this assessment involves estimating cash flows for future periods 
if the future cash flows were materially less than the recorded goodwill and other intangible assets balances  we would be required to take a charge against earnings to write down the assets to the lower value 
the company s assessment at december  pursuant to its goodwill impairment testing policy resulted in no impairment 
deferred tax assets we use an estimate of future earnings to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
if future income should prove nonexistent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the asset may not be realized and our net income will be reduced 
our deferred tax assets are described further in note of the consolidated financial statements 
supplemental employee compensation benefits agreements as described in note of the consolidated financial statements  we have entered into supplemental employee compensation benefits agreements with certain executive and senior officers 
the measurement of the liability under these agreements includes estimates involving life expectancy  length of time before retirement  and expected benefit levels 
should these estimates prove materially wrong  we could incur additional or reduced expense to provide the benefits 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements for a listing of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company  including the notes thereto  appearing elsewhere in this report 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities in the ordinary course of business  the company may enter into off balance sheet financial instruments consisting of commitments to extend credit  commercial letters of credit  and standby letters of credit 
such financial instruments are recorded in the financial statement when they are funded or related fees are incurred or received dollar amounts in thousands less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years total december  long term debt obligations operating lease obligations totals as noted in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is contingently liable for letters of credit made to its customers in the ordinary course of business totaling million at december   slightly lower from the million reported at the end of additionally  at december  the company had un disbursed loan commitments  also made in the ordinary course of business  totaling approximately million 
when compared to the million reported at the end of  this represents an increase of approximately million  the majority of which can be attributed to the acquisition of business first 
the company has an allowance for losses unfunded commitments totaling thousand at december   to cover losses inherent in its letter of credit accommodations and un disbursed loan commitments 
there are no special purpose entity spe trusts  corporations  or other legal entities established by the company which reside off balance sheet 
there are no other off balance sheet items other than the aforementioned items related to letter of credit accommodations and un disbursed loan commitments 
as noted in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company does make loans to related parties directors and officers in the ordinary course of business at prevailing rates and terms 
these loans totaled million and million at the end of and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of interest income and interest expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
virtually all of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are located at the banking subsidiary level 
thus  virtually all of the company s interest rate risk exposure lies at the banking subsidiary level other than million in subordinated debentures issued by the company s subsidiary grantor trusts 
as a result  all significant interest rate risk procedures are performed at the banking subsidiary level 
the subsidiary bank s real estate loan portfolio  concentrated primarily within santa barbara and san luis obispo counties  of california  are subject to risks associated with the local economy 
the fundamental objective of the company s management of its assets and liabilities is to maximize the company s economic value while maintaining adequate liquidity and an exposure to interest rate risk deemed by management to be acceptable 
management believes an acceptable degree of exposure to interest rate risk results from the management of assets and liabilities through maturities  pricing and mix to attempt to neutralize the potential impact of changes in market interest rates 
the company s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and its interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
the company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets re price differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity  and coordinating its sources and uses of funds 
the company seeks to control interest rate risk exposure in a manner that will allow for adequate levels of earnings and capital over a range of possible interest rate environments 
the company has adopted formal policies and practices to monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure 
management believes historically it has effectively managed the effect of changes in interest rates on its operating results 
management believes that it can continue to manage the short term effect of interest rate changes under various interest rate scenarios 
management employs the use of an asset and liability management software that is used to measure the bank s exposure to future changes in interest rates 
this model measures the expected cash flows and re pricing of each financial asset liability separately in measuring the bank s interest sensitivity 
based on the results of this model  management believes the bank s balance sheet is asset sensitive 
the company generally expects expansion in its net interest income if rates rise and expects  conversely  contraction if rates fall 
the level of potential or expected contraction indicated by the tables below is considered acceptable by management and is compliant with the bank s alco policies 
management will continue to perform this analysis each quarter to further validate the expected results against actual data 
the hypothetical impacts of sudden interest rate movements applied to the company s asset and liability balances are modeled monthly 
the results of this movement indicate how much of the company s net interest income is at risk from various rate changes over a one year horizon 
this exercise is valuable in identifying risk exposures 
the results for the company s december  balances indicate that the net interest income at risk over a one year time horizon for a and rate increase and decrease are within the company s policy guidelines for such changes 
rate shock scenarios dollar amounts in thousands bp bp base bp bp net interest income nii dollar change from base percent change from base it is important to note that the above table is a summary of several forecasts and actual results may vary 
the forecasts are based on estimates and assumptions of management that may turn out to be different and may change over time 
factors affecting these estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to competitor behavior  economic conditions both locally and nationally  actions taken by the federal reserve board  customer behavior and management s responses 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions and estimates may have significant effects on the company s net interest income  therefore  the results of this analysis should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
the company also attempts to quantify the impact of interest rate changes on borrowers ability to pay on loans and the impact of similar rate changes on the value of collateral held against loans 
to this end  the company  from time to time  will sample loans and analyze them under a rate shock scenario to specifically assess the impact of the rate shock on financial ratios such as interest rate coverage and loan to value 
the results of the analysis have generally revealed that in the case of such a rate shock  a high percentage of loans tested would continue to express ratios within current underwriting guidelines 
the results of these analyses are considered acceptable by management
