item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those set forth in part i item a above under the caption risk factors 
see cautionary note regarding forward looking statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for periods prior to may   the results of operations and cash flows presented in the consolidated financial statements contained herein reflect micromet ag only 
for periods from may  the date of the closing of the merger between micromet ag and cancervax corporation through december   and for the year ended december   the results of operations and cash flows presented in the consolidated financial statements contained herein reflect the combined operations of cancervax and micromet ag 
accordingly  the results of operations and cash flows for the year ended december  presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations and cash flows that we would experience if the operations of the two companies had been combined for the entire period presented 
overview merger of cancervax corporation and micromet ag on may   cancervax completed a merger with micromet ag  a privately held german company 
cancervax was incorporated in the state of delaware on june   and completed an initial public offering on november  following its merger with cancervax  former micromet ag security holders owned  as of the closing of the merger  approximately of the combined company on a fully diluted basis and former cancervax security holders owned  as of the closing  approximately of the combined company on a fully diluted basis 
cancervax was renamed micromet  inc and our nasdaq global market ticker symbol was changed to miti 
as former micromet ag security holders owned approximately of the voting stock of the combined company immediately after the merger  micromet ag was deemed to be the acquiring company for accounting purposes and the transaction was accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
accordingly  unless otherwise noted  all pre merger financial information is that of micromet ag  and all post merger financial information is that of micromet  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries  including micromet ag 
ongoing business activities we are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel  proprietary antibodies for the treatment of cancer  inflammation and autoimmune diseases 
three of our antibodies are currently in clinical trials  while the remainder of our product pipeline is in preclinical development 
mt  the most advanced antibody in our product pipeline developed using our bite antibody technology platform  is being evaluated in a phase clinical trial for the treatment of patients with all and in a phase clinical trial for the treatment of patients with nhl 
bite antibodies represent a new class of antibodies that activate a patient s own cytotoxic t cells  considered the most powerful killer cells of the human immune system  to eliminate cancer cells 
we are developing mt in collaboration with medimmune 
our second clinical stage antibody is adecatumumab  a human monoclonal antibody which targets epcam expressing solid tumors 
we are developing adecatumumab in collaboration with merck serono in a phase b clinical trial evaluating adecatumumab in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of patients with metastatic breast cancer 
mt  our third clinical stage antibody  is licensed to tracon  and is being developed in a phase clinical trial for the treatment of patients with cancer 
mt  a bite antibody targeting epcam expressing tumors  has completed preclinical development  and we plan to initiate clinical development in in addition  we have established a collaboration with nycomed for the development and commercialization of mt  our human antibody neutralizing the activity of gm csf  which has potential applications in the treatment of various inflammatory and autoimmune diseases  such as rheumatoid arthritis  psoriasis  or multiple sclerosis 
further  we have used and will continue to use our proprietary bite antibody technology platform to generate additional antibodies for our product pipeline 
to date  we have incurred significant research and development expenses and have not achieved any product revenues from sales of our product candidates 
each of our programs will require many years and significant costs to advance through development 
typically  it takes many years from the initial identification of a lead compound to the completion of preclinical and clinical trials  before applying for marketing approval from the fda or emea  or equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries and regions 
the risk that a program has to be terminated  in part or in full  for safety reasons or lack of adequate efficacy is very high 
in particular  we can neither predict which  if any  potential product candidates can be successfully developed and for which marketing approval may be obtained  nor predict the time and cost to complete development 
as we obtain results from preclinical studies or clinical trials  we may elect to discontinue the development for certain product candidates for safety  efficacy or commercial reasons 
we may also elect to discontinue development of one or more product candidates in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates 
our business strategy includes entering into collaborative agreements with third parties for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
depending on the structure of such collaborative agreements  a third party may be granted control over the clinical trial process for one of our product candidates 
in such a situation  the third party  rather than us  may in fact control development and commercialization decisions for the respective product candidate 
consistent with our business model  we may enter into additional collaboration agreements in the future 
we cannot predict the terms of such agreements or their potential impact on our capital requirements 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner  or our failure to enter into new collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and affect our liquidity 
since our inception  we have financed our operations through private placements of preferred stock  government grants for research  research contribution revenues from our collaborations with pharmaceutical companies  debt financing  licensing revenues and milestone achievements and  more recently  by accessing the capital resources of cancervax through the merger and a subsequent private placement of common stock and associated warrants 
we intend to continue to seek funding through public or private financings in the future 
if we are successful in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  stockholders may experience substantial dilution  or the equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to existing stockholders 
if we are successful in raising additional funds through debt financings  these financings may involve significant cash payment obligations and covenants that restrict our ability to operate our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising additional capital on acceptable terms  or at all 
research and development and in process research and development through december   our research and development expenses consisted of costs associated with the clinical development of adecatumumab and mt  as well as development costs incurred for mt and mt  research activities under our collaboration with medimmune and nycomed  and research conducted with respect to the bite antibody platform 
the costs incurred include costs associated with clinical trials and manufacturing process  quality systems and analytical development  including compensation and other personnel expenses  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and related contract research  facility costs  license fees and depreciation 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
in addition  as a result of our merger with cancervax  we acquired in process research and development ipr d projects with an assigned value of million in the fair value of the ipr d projects was determined utilizing the income approach  assuming that the rights to the ipr d projects will be sub licensed to third parties in exchange for certain up front  milestone and royalty payments  and the combined company will have no further involvement in the ongoing development and commercialization of the projects 
under the income approach  the expected future net cash flows from sub licensing for each ipr d project are estimated  risk adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in the development process and discounted to their net present value 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the discount rate are the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets 
management believes that the discount rate utilized is consistent with the projects stage of development and the uncertainties in the estimates described above 
because the acquired ipr d projects are in the early stages of the development cycle  the amount allocated to ipr d were recorded as an expense immediately upon completion of the merger 
we expect to incur substantial additional research and development expenses that may increase from historical levels as we further develop our compounds into more advanced stages of clinical development and increase our preclinical efforts for our human antibodies and bite antibodies in cancer  anti inflammatory and autoimmune diseases 
our strategic collaborations and license agreements generally provide for our research  development and commercialization programs to be partly or wholly funded by our collaborators and provide us with the opportunity to receive additional payments if specified development or commercialization milestones are achieved  as well as royalty payments upon the successful commercialization of any products based upon our collaborations 
under our collaboration agreement with merck serono  we received million in up front and milestone payments from merck serono to date not including reimbursements for costs and expenses incurred in connection with the development of adecatumumab 
the agreement provides for potential future clinical development milestone payments of up to an additional million 
in a november amendment to the original agreement  we and merck serono agreed that micromet would continue to conduct an ongoing phase clinical trial testing the safety of adecatumumab in combination with docetaxel in patients with metastatic breast cancer 
in october  we and merck serono further amended the agreement and reallocated certain of our respective development responsibilities with respect to adecatumumab 
as part of the revised responsibilities  micromet now has all decision making authority and operational responsibility for the ongoing phase clinical trial  as well as an additional clinical trial to be conducted by us 
merck serono will continue to bear the development expenses associated with the collaboration in accordance with the agreed upon budget 
our collaboration agreement with medimmune for mt provides for potential future milestone payments and royalty payments based on net sales of mt a second agreement with medimmune for the development of new bite antibodies provides for potential future milestone payments and royalty payments based on future sales of the bite antibodies currently under development pursuant to that agreement 
the potential milestone payments are subject to the successful completion of development and obtaining marketing approval for one or more indications in one or more national markets 
we intend to pursue additional collaborations to provide resources for further development of our product candidates and expect to continue to grant technology access licenses 
however  we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether we will be able to enter into collaborative agreements  and if we do  on what terms we might do so 
we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates 
however  we expect our research and development costs associated with these product candidates to increase as we continue to develop new indications and advance these product candidates through preclinical and clinical trials 
clinical development timelines  the likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which research and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate as well as relevant commercial factors 
the costs and timing for developing and obtaining regulatory approvals of our product candidates vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to estimate 
the expenditure of substantial resources will be required for the lengthy process of clinical development and obtaining regulatory approvals as well as to comply with applicable regulations 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such statements require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k  we believe the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements which require significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition our revenues generally consist of licensing fees  milestone payments  royalties and fees for research services earned from license agreements or from research and development collaboration agreements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  upon the satisfaction of the following four criteria persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue on up front payments over the expected life of the development and collaboration agreement on a straight line basis 
milestone payments are derived from the achievement of predetermined goals under the collaboration agreements 
for milestones that are subject to contingencies  the related contingent revenue is not recognized until the milestone has been reached and customer acceptance has been obtained as necessary 
fees for research and development services performed under the agreements are generally stated at a yearly fixed fee per research scientist 
we recognize revenue as the services are performed 
amounts received in advance of services performed are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
we have received initial license fees and annual renewal fees upfront each year under license agreements 
revenue is recognized when the above noted criteria are satisfied unless we have further obligations associated with the license granted 
we are entitled to receive royalty payments on the sale of products under license and collaboration agreements 
royalties are based upon the volume of products sold and are recognized as revenue upon notification of sales from the customer 
through december   we have not received or recognized any royalty payments 
for arrangements that include multiple deliverables  we identify separate units of accounting based on the consensus reached on emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf no 
provides that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met 
the consideration for the arrangement is allocated to the separated units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered separately for each unit of accounting 
we recognize revenue on development and collaboration agreements  including upfront payments  where they are considered combined units of accounting  over the expected life of the development and collaboration agreement on a straight line basis 
purchase price allocation in business combinations the allocation of purchase price for business combinations requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  and liabilities assumed based on their respective values 
in fiscal  we completed our merger with cancervax 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion 
goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill 
instead  we review goodwill for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned 
conditions that would necessitate a goodwill impairment assessment include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a loss of key personnel  or the presence of other indicators that would indicate a reduction in the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned 
sfas no 
prescribes a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first step of the impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to its carrying amount  including the goodwill 
such a valuation requires significant estimates and assumptions including but not limited to determining the timing and expected costs to complete in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash inflows from product sales and other sources  and developing appropriate discount rates and success probability rates by project 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed in order to measure the impairment loss 
as a result of our merger with cancervax  we recorded million of goodwill 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment for fiscal year in accordance with sfas no 
and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was recoverable 
we cannot assure you that our future reviews of goodwill impairment will not result in a material charge 
long lived and intangible assets the evaluation for impairment of long lived and intangible assets requires significant estimates and judgment by management 
subsequent to the initial recording of long lived and intangible assets  we must test such assets for impairment 
when we conduct our impairment tests  factors that are important in determining whether impairment might exist include assumptions regarding our underlying business and product candidates and other factors specific to each asset being evaluated 
any changes in key assumptions about our business and our prospects  or changes in market conditions or other external factors  could result in impairment 
such impairment charge  if any  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  or sab  requiring the measurement and recognition of all share based compensation under the fair value method 
effective january   we began recognizing share based compensation  under sfas no 
r  for all awards granted after january   based on each award s grant date fair value 
prior to adopting the provisions of sfas no 
r  we recorded estimated compensation expense for employee stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  following the minimum value method 
under the guidance of sfas  we estimated the value of stock options issued to employees using the black scholes options pricing model with a near zero volatility assumption a minimum value model 
the value was determined based on the stock price of our stock on the date of grant and was recognized to expense over the vesting period using the straight line method 
we implemented sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method our financial statements and related information presented pertaining to periods prior to our adoption of sfas no 
r has not been adjusted to reflect fair value of the share based compensation expense 
prior to january   there was no significant stock compensation expense recorded 
we estimate the fair value of each share based award on the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
to facilitate our adoption of sfas no 
r  we applied the provisions of sab in developing our methodologies to estimate our black scholes model inputs 
option valuation models  including black scholes  require the input of highly subjective assumptions  and changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the grant date fair value of an award 
these assumptions include the risk free rate of interest  expected dividend yield  expected volatility  and the expected life of the award 
the risk free rate of interest is based on the us treasury rates appropriate for the expected term of the award 
expected dividend yield is projected at as we have not paid any dividends on our common stock since our inception and we do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
expected volatility is based on our historical volatility and the historical volatilities of the common stock of comparable publicly traded companies 
the expected term of at the money options granted is derived from the average midpoint between vesting and the contractual term  as described in sab the expected term for other options granted was determined by comparison to peer companies 
sfas no 
r also requires that forfeitures be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the pre vesting forfeiture rate for the year ended december  was based on historical forfeiture experience for similar levels of employees to whom the options were granted 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options was approximately million and the weighted average period over which it is expected to be recognized is years 
common stock warrants liability in accordance with eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  we classify warrants as liabilities when the potential for a net cash settlement to the holders of the warrants exists  even if remote 
eitf also requires that the warrants be revalued as derivative instruments at each reporting period end 
we adjust the instruments to their current fair value using the black scholes model formula at each reporting period end  with the change in value recorded in the statement of operations 
recent accounting standards and pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
it also provides guidance relating to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value  and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
under sfas no 
 companies may elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis 
any changes in fair value are to be recognized in earnings each reporting period 
the election must be applied to individual instruments  is irrevocable for every instrument chosen to be measured at fair value  and must be applied to an entire instrument and not to portions of instruments 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in june  the fasb also ratified eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities be deferred and capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf is effective  on a prospective basis  for fiscal years beginning after december   and we adopted it as of the beginning of fiscal we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
the objective of sfas is to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  that is  january   for entities with calendar year ends 
earlier adoption is prohibited 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations 
the objective of sfas r is to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness  and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  an entity may not apply sfas r before that date 
we intend to apply sfas r in connection with future business combinations  if any 
in december   the fasb ratified eitf  accounting for collaborative arrangement  eitf 
eitf requires participants in a collaborative arrangement to present the results of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and to report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
significant disclosures of the collaborative agreements are also required 
eitf is effective for annual periods beginning after december  and to be applied retrospectively for collaborative arrangements existing at december  as a change of accounting principle 
we do not expect this issue to have a material effect on our financial statements 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and december  revenues 
the following table summarizes our primary sources of revenue for the periods presented in millions for the year ended december  december  collaborative r d revenue merck serono medimmune nycomed tracon other total collaborative r d revenue license and other revenue total revenues collaborative research and development revenues from merck serono reflect merck serono s full cost responsibility for the adecatumumab program 
collaborative research and development revenues from medimmune represent medimmune s share of the costs of clinical development of mt and its full cost responsibility for the development of mt and the epha bite antibody 
collaborative research and development revenues from nycomed reflect nycomed s full cost responsibility for the mt program 
collaborative research and development revenues from tracon reflect tracon s full cost responsibility for the mt program 
the decrease for the year related to merck serono results from a million milestone payment recognized during the fourth quarter of with no such milestone during  and also from the result of amendments to our collaboration agreement with merck serono that had the effect of lengthening the time over which revenue is recognized for the phase study of mt in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer 
the period was extended from june to june the increase in medimmune revenue was due to increases in the work performed under our mt program of million and from milestone revenues in our bite program recognized during of million 
these were substantially offset by a decrease of million in mt milestone revenues that were recognized during the nycomed collaboration commenced during and there was no corresponding revenue generating activity during the prior year 
the nycomed revenue represents the reimbursement of our preclinical development activities  including reimbursement for full time equivalents as well as the portion of the up front payment from nycomed that is being recognized over a year period 
the tracon revenue during represents the sale of clinical material  cell banks  and toxicology materials transferred under the terms of our agreement with tracon  miscellaneous pass through expenses and the portion of the up front payment received from tracon that is being recognized over a year period 
this collaboration also commenced during  and there was no corresponding revenue generating activity during also contributing to the overall decrease in revenues was a settlement payment of million received during from cell therapeutics  inc cti  the acquirer of novuspharma spa  with whom we previously had a research and development collaboration 
the settlement payment was included in collaboration revenue because the amount would have been recorded as collaboration revenue had the original contract been fulfilled 
license and other revenue decreased due to a milestone payment received during related to our single chain antibody technology 
research and development expenses 
research and development expense consists of costs incurred to discover and develop product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  outside service costs including production of clinical material  fees for services in the context of clinical trials  medicinal chemistry  consulting and sponsored research collaborations  and occupancy and depreciation charges 
process development expenses were mainly incurred for production of gmp grade clinical trial material  as well as fermentation  purification and formulation development 
preclinical development expenses cover pharmacological in vitro and in vivo experiments as well as development of analytical testing procedures 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
increases in personnel expenses of million and manufacturing and preclinical expenses of million were partially offset by a decrease in share based compensation expense of million due to acceleration of vesting during in connection with the cancervax merger 
in process research and development 
as a result of our merger with cancervax  we acquired ipr d projects with an assigned value of million 
the fair value of the ipr d projects was determined utilizing the income approach  assuming that the rights to the ipr d projects will be sub licensed to third parties in exchange for certain up front  milestone and royalty payments  and the combined company will have no further involvement in the ongoing development and commercialization of the projects 
under the income approach  the expected future net cash flows from sub licensing for each ipr d project were estimated and risk adjusted to reflect the risks inherent in the development process and discounted to their net present value 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the discount rate were the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets 
management believes that the discount rate utilized is consistent with the projects stage of development and the uncertainties in the estimates described above 
because the acquired ipr d projects are in the early stages of the development cycle  the amount allocated to ipr d were recorded as an expense immediately upon completion of the merger 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  legal  information technology  corporate communications and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  insurance  and professional fees for legal and audit services 
general and administrative expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase results from higher personnel  severance  and travel costs of million due to the full year of having the public company infrastructure 
in addition  investor relations costs increased by million resulting from the higher costs of being a public company 
facility charges increased by million due to an adjustment to our lease exit liability related to the former cancervax headquarters 
partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in share based compensation expense of million due to acceleration of vesting during in connection with the cancervax merger 
interest expense 
interest expense for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease was due to the repayment of a million bank loan in the third quarter of  from the conversion of convertible notes during  and from the repayment of silent partnership debt during and change in fair value of common stock warrants liability 
under the terms of the warrants issued in connection with a private placement that closed in june  if a fundamental transaction as defined in the warrant occurs  we or any successor entity are obligated to purchase any unexercised warrants from the holder for cash in an amount equal to its value computed using the black scholes option pricing model with prescribed guidelines 
as a consequence of these provisions  the warrants are classified as a liability on our balance sheet 
the income of million recorded during represents the change in fair value of the warrants as of december  as compared to the value on june   the date of issuance 
other income expense 
other income expense includes foreign currency transaction gains losses and miscellaneous other items 
other income expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the increase results from a release of million of recorded obligations to an unrelated party in exchange for the return of ex us rights to technology which we no longer intended to pursue 
in addition  we received a refund of withholding taxes of million from the german tax authorities 
exchange gains of million were recorded during liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the increase in results from the private placement financing in june  which yielded net proceeds to us of million  as well as the upfront license fee of approximately million received from nycomed  and the upfront license fee of million received from tracon  less repayments of short and long term debt of million and decreases in other collaboration revenues  and increases in general operating expenses  as described above 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million used in operating activities for the year ended december  the overall increase in operating cash flows was due to up front license fees received from nycomed of million and from upfront license fees of million received from tracon offset by lower revenues of million earned in compared to when we had received a million milestone payment from merck serono 
there were also increases in accounts receivable related to our license agreements with nycomed  tracon and medimmune  and a decrease in accounts payable due to the payment of withholding taxes and accrued clinical expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million provided by investing activities for the year ended december  the decrease is due to the receipt during of million of cash  net of costs paid  acquired in connection with our merger with cancervax 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million used in financing activities for the year ended december  most of the increase was due to the june private placement of common stock and warrants which resulted in net proceeds of approximately million 
we also repaid approximately million in silent partnership debt as a consequence of the private placement as compared to repayments during of million to silicon valley bank and million to silent partnerships 
to date  we have funded our operations through proceeds from private placements of preferred stock  government grants for research  research contribution revenues from our collaborations with pharmaceutical companies  licensing and milestone payments related to our product candidate partnering activities  debt financing and by accessing the capital resources of cancervax through the merger and through subsequent private placements of common stock and associated warrants 
we expect that operating losses and negative cash flows from operations will continue for at least the next several years and we will need to raise additional funds to meet future working capital and capital expenditure needs 
we may wish to raise substantial funds through the sale of our common stock or raise additional funds through debt financing or through additional strategic collaboration agreements 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or whether it will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
based on our capital resources as of the date of this report  we believe that we have adequate resources to fund our operations into the second quarter of  without considering any potential future milestone payments  that we may receive under current or future collaborations  any future capital raising transactions or any drawdowns from our ceff with kingsbridge capital limited 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs and other operations 
if we were to raise additional funds through the issuance of common stock  substantial dilution to our existing stockholders would likely result 
if we were to raise additional funds through additional debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
if we raise funds through corporate collaborations or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish  on terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
failure to obtain adequate financing may adversely affect our operating results or our ability to operate as a going concern 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors and involves risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in risk factors herein 
in light of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the number  scope  rate of progress  results and costs of our preclinical studies  clinical trials and other research and development activities  the terms and timing of any distribution  corporate collaborations that we may establish  and the success of these collaborations  the cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals  the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue  the cost and timing of establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales  and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
we are parties to three irrevocable standby letters of credit in connection with building leases entered into by cancervax and our current building leases in munich  germany and bethesda  maryland 
as of december   we had million of cash and certificates of deposit relating to these letters of credit that are considered restricted cash  all of which is recorded as a non current asset 
contractual obligations we have contractual obligations  some of which were assumed in our merger with cancervax  related to our facility lease  research agreements and financing agreements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents 
these financial instruments  principally comprised of corporate obligations and us and foreign government obligations  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
because of the relatively short maturities of our investments  we do not expect interest rate fluctuations to materially affect the aggregate value of our financial instruments 
we do not have derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
exchange rates a significant majority of our cash and cash equivalents are currently denominated in us dollars  as are a significant amount of the potential milestone payments and royalty payments under our collaboration agreements 
however  a significant portion of our operating expenses  including our research and development expenses  are incurred in europe pursuant to arrangements that are generally denominated in euros 
as a result  our financial results and capital resources may be affected by changes in the us dollar euro exchange rate 
as of december   we had us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents of million and euro denominated liabilities of approximately million 
the euro amount as of december  is equivalent to approximately million  using the exchange rate as of that date 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro would result in an increase in our reported operating expenses due to the translation of the euro denominated expenses into us dollars  and such changes would negatively impact the length of time that our existing capital resources would be sufficient to finance our operations 
we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging transactions to manage this exchange rate exposure
