item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction deltic timber corporation deltic or the company is a natural resources company engaged primarily in the growing and harvesting of timber and the manufacture and marketing of lumber 
deltic owns approximately  acres of timberland  primarily in arkansas and north louisiana 
the company s sawmill operations are located at ola in central arkansas the ola mill and at waldo in south arkansas the waldo mill 
in addition to its timber and lumber operations  the company is engaged in real estate development in central arkansas 
the company also holds a percent interest in del tin fiber llc del tin fiber  a joint venture to manufacture and market medium density fiberboard mdf 
deltic is a calendar year company for both financial and income tax reporting 
the company is organized into four segments woodlands  which manages the company s timberlands  mills  which consists of deltic s two sawmills that manufacture a variety of softwood lumber products  real estate  which includes the company s real estate developments and a related country club operation  and corporate  which consists of executive management  accounting  information systems  human resources  purchasing  treasury  income tax  and legal staff functions that provide support services to the operating business units 
the company currently does not allocate the cost of maintaining these support functions to its operating units 
the company s timberlands consist primarily of southern pine  known in the industry as a type of softwood 
deltic considers its timberlands to be the company s most valuable asset and the harvest of stumpage to be its most significant source of income  accordingly  deltic actively manages its timberlands to increase productivity and maximize the long term value of these timber assets 
the company harvests timber from the timberlands in accordance with its harvest plans and sells such timber in the domestic market or converts it to lumber in its sawmills 
stumpage supplied to the company s sawmills is transferred at prices that approximate market 
the company implemented a timberland acquisition program in late  and this ongoing program has enabled the company  when desired  to increase harvest levels  while expanding its timber inventory 
thus far  the company has focused its acquisition program on timberland in its current operating area 
the company s two sawmills employ modern technology in order to improve efficiency  reduce labor costs  maximize utilization of the timber resource  and maintain high standards for production quality with safety being one of its highest priorities 
in addition  each mill is strategically located near significant portions of the company s timberlands 
the mills produce a variety of lumber products  including dimension lumber  boards  timbers  and decking 
these lumber products are sold primarily to wholesale distributors  lumber treaters  and truss manufacturers in the south and mid western united states and are used mainly in residential construction  roof trusses  and laminated beams 
the company s real estate operations were started in to maximize the value of former timberland strategically located in the growth corridor of west little rock  arkansas 
since that time  the company has been developing chenal valley  a premier planned community consisting of  acres of residential and commercial properties 
the property is being developed in stages  and real estate sales to date have consisted primarily of residential lots  which are sold to builders or individuals  and commercial sites 
in addition to chenal valley  deltic has developed chenal downs  a acre development located just outside chenal valley  and is developing red oak ridge  an acre development in hot springs  arkansas 
the del tin fiber plant is located near el dorado  arkansas 
construction of the plant was completed  and initial production began in the plant is designed to have a rated annual production capacity of million square feet mmsf of inch mdf  making it one of the largest plants of its type in the world 
mdf  which is used primarily in the furniture  flooring  and molding industries  is manufactured from sawmill residuals such as chips  shavings  and sawdust  pressed and held together by an adhesive bond 

table of contents executive overview deltic is primarily a wood products producer operating in a commodity based business environment  with a major diversification in real estate development 
this environment is affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  interest rates  imports  foreign exchange rates  housing starts  residential repair and remodeling  commercial construction  industry capacity and production levels  the availability of raw material  and weather conditions 
given its relative size and the nature of most commodity markets  the company has little or no influence over the market s pricing levels for its wood products 
accordingly  the company will continually seek to reduce controllable costs and expenses from its manufacturing processes 
sales of real estate are affected by general economic conditions and interest rates  specifically as such factors are manifested in the company s operating area of central arkansas 
significant accomplishments for the company s operating segments during the year of include the woodlands segment maximized the income contribution realized from the harvest of pine pulpwood by achieving an average sales price per ton that was percent higher than in  the mills segment continued to improve operating efficiencies and reduced unit manufacturing costs  which contributed to this segment s positive cash flow in despite depressed average sales realizations  the real estate segment sold two commercial sites totaling approximately acres for use as multifamily housing  one of which will be the first condominium project on the golf courses in deltic s chenal valley development  and the sale of acres of undeveloped real estate acreage to central arkansas water  settling pending condemnation litigation 
the woodlands segment continued its trend of steady contributions to earnings during the current year 
the pine sawtimber harvest volume decreased slightly to  tons when compared to s volume of  tons  and the average sales price decreased percent to per ton 
despite the decline in the average pine sawtimber sales price  the segment s overall operating income increased by million 
the improvement was primarily due to increased harvest volumes and a higher average per ton sales price for pulpwood  increased sales of non strategic hardwood bottomland  higher revenues from hunting and oil and gas leases  easements and rights of way  and increased other revenues resulting from the natural gas drilling activity occurring on the company s fee lands  including damages for acreage taken out of timber production for wellsite locations  fees for allowing seismic testing  and usage of water in the actual drilling of wells 
deltic expects the markets for residential housing and lumber to remain depressed through  therefore  prices received for pine sawtimber harvested for this period are not expected to improve from current levels 
while lumber production levels within a region can influence pine sawtimber prices  lumber prices typically do not 
over the long term  there is a fundamental correlation between the level of lumber prices and pine sawtimber prices 
however  in the short term  the geographical size differential between the lumber and pine sawtimber markets results in the two acting somewhat independently of each other 
pine sawtimber markets operate primarily within local or regional areas with sales being mainly to sawmills 
these mills are subject to a relatively fixed level of demand for raw materials that is driven by the facilities required production levels 
changes in pricing levels within the lumber market typically do not have an immediate effect on the existing demand for raw materials in the short term  therefore  the resulting impact on pine sawtimber prices will usually lag in timing and be less volatile than the market for lumber 
this trend would typically also be true in the short term during times of a depressed lumber market 
ultimately  the company s ability to sell pine sawtimber at acceptable prices in the future will be dependent upon the size or existence of markets for manufactured lumber and other wood products 
the company plans to continue managing the harvest level of its forests on a sustainable yield basis 
timberland designated as higher and better use consists of tracts with market values that exceed the land s worth as a timber growing platform 
deltic s approximately  acre timberland holdings in the expanding westward growth corridor of little rock  arkansas  is an example of such land 
non strategic timberland is composed primarily of hardwood bottomland acreage not suitable for the growing of pine timber for which the demand by recreational users for hunting  etc 
has increased in recent years or tracts too small to allow efficient timber management  those geographically isolated from other company fee lands  or any other acreage not 
table of contents deemed strategic to deltic s operations or growth 
deltic sold approximately acres of this non strategic hardwood timberland during it has identified approximately  additional such acres  therefore  sales of these acres will continue in and beyond as the market is capable of absorbing 
in addition to pine and hardwood timber sales  revenues from hunting leases  mineral lease bonuses and royalties  and land easements  have historically provided additional income to deltic s woodlands segment 
recent advances in technology and increased pricing levels have resulted in the economic viability of expanded natural gas exploration within the state of arkansas 
one current area of activity  known as the fayetteville shale play  is an unconventional natural gas reservoir  ranging in depth from  feet to  feet  and is spread across multiple arkansas counties 
deltic has leased approximately  acres in this area to various exploration enterprises and received applicable lease bonus payments and the possibility of future royalty income should production be established 
the company continues to evaluate additional leasing requests within the currently defined boundary of the fayetteville shale play  although future leasing will probably not be significant within this boundary 
the ultimate benefit to deltic from these mineral leases remains speculative and unknown to the company and is contingent on the successful extraction and sale of natural gas from the area 
for the mills segment  the status of the lumber market and the resulting impact on the company s commodity softwood lumber products will continue to impact operating strategies and financial results 
by the end of  the seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts had reached its lowest level in years 
several of the factors affecting this decline were stricter mortgage lending practices brought about by sub prime loan failures  construction loan delinquencies that are causing lenders to tighten credit for new developments  increased home inventory levels  and economic concerns with the us economy 
consequently  the high demand and pricing levels for softwood lumber products experienced during and have steadily declined for the past two years 
the segment s average lumber sales price declined nine percent when compared to as with any commodity market  the company expects the historical volatility of lumber prices to continue in the future 
many industry analysts are projecting that the market for new housing will continue to decline through the second quarter of and possibly the entire year 
other factors impacting future lumber prices include the level of production capacity utilized  decreased imports due the declining dollar  and the level of repair and remodeling activity 
since commodity based markets rarely benefit from real price growth  after inflation  deltic has concentrated management s attention  in regard to its manufacturing operations  on improving sales realizations through product and customer mix enhancements and improving production efficiencies and the cost structure at its lumber mills 
the company has achieved improved production efficiencies at both of its sawmills  largely as a result of an intensive capital upgrade program over the past three years 
this improvement has been more significant at the ola mill  as the upgrade program there has focused on maximizing hourly productivity rates with the smaller log size available as raw material for the mill 
in  deltic plans to install a new log bucking system at this sawmill  improving the log to lumber yield ratio there  and this addition will essentially complete the currently planned upgrade program for this facility 
on august  the waldo mill incurred a fire in its planer mill that destroyed the planer machine located there 
due to the inability to timely finish the rough lumber manufactured in the sawmill or store such lumber until a new planer machine could be manufactured and installed without incurring substantial quality downgrades  the company elected to shut down the waldo mill until the fire related repairs could be made 
such repairs were completed at the end of october  and the mill resumed production at hourly production rates at or above pre fire levels 
as a result of this three month shutdown period  a decrease in the volume of finished lumber produced and sold for the year was reported by the mills segment 
this fire incident was fully insured by property damage and business interruption policies 
proceeds received from these coverages made the mill whole from a financial perspective 
sales activity levels for the company s real estate developments are affected by economic conditions that influence the level of housing starts in the central arkansas region  including general economic conditions  housing inventories  and stricter lending requirements for home buyers and builders 
these conditions contributed to a decrease in the overall demand for residential lots in chenal valley  the largest of the company s three active developments  as evidenced by chenal valley s residential lot closings 

table of contents this was a reduction of lots from s level of residential lot closings 
as of december   there were developed lots in chenal valley uncommitted 
the company plans to develop new lots during to maintain a specific mix of lot offerings 
ultimately  the impact to deltic s overall real estate business model from moderate fluctuations in the annual volumes of residential lot sales is deemed minimal in light of the company s continued focus on the long term financial returns from the ultimate build out of the chenal valley development 
in deltic s other two active developments  red oak ridge had sales of seven lots and chenal downs had one lot sale 
deltic has developed lots in red oak ridge and in chenal downs uncommitted as of year end while chenal downs is fully developed  deltic plans to develop additional lots within red oak ridge as demanded by market conditions 
actual future annual lot development levels will be dependent upon the demand for the company s residential lots 
the real estate segment s average sales price for residential lots sold in was  which was a decrease of percent when compared to  due to the current year sales mix 
deltic s lot development plans provide for a mix of lot offerings that represent all real estate market segments for a planned community 
neighborhoods adjoining chenal country club s second hole  championship golf course designed by robert trent jones  jr 
represent the highest priced market segment in the chenal valley development 
average prices for non golf course lots are lower and vary between neighborhoods depending on other factors such as lot size and location 
the mix of lot offerings for any given year will be driven by lot inventory and expected demand 
during  the company disclosed plans for a  acre residential development on a portion of its land holdings located within the highway growth corridor west of chenal valley 
a portion of the development would have been located within the watershed of lake maumelle  a principal source of drinking water for little rock 
even though the company s development plans incorporated the most modern and proven best management practices to create a low impact development fully protective of water quality in the lake  and the local water utility  central arkansas water caw  had just commissioned preparation of a new comprehensive watershed management plan  the water utility nonetheless commenced an action in september to condemn approximately acres of company land located within the watershed  including approximately acres in the planned development 
on march   the company and caw entered into a full and complete settlement of the condemnation 
pursuant to the terms of the settlement  the company sold caw acres of land for million  and caw granted to the company a year option to repurchase the land for the same consideration should caw determine the land is not needed for watershed protection or should caw cease to utilize the land for such purpose 
commercial real estate sales activity is by nature less predictable than residential activity 
with the number of residents in chenal valley and other west little rock areas growing steadily  and momentum created from previous sales of commercial acreage in the development  interest in the company s remaining commercial acreage is increasing 
the volume of commercial sales totaled approximately acres in versus acres in the average sales price per acre decreased slightly from  for to  for future pricing trends for commercial real estate sales are difficult to predict and are influenced by multiple factors  which include intended use of the site  motivation of the purchaser  and property location and access 
no commercial acreage is included in the chenal downs development 
red oak ridge includes a small amount of commercial property  depending on actual final land usages 
the company will begin to develop and offer commercial sites as this development s population density increases 
operating results for del tin fiber are affected primarily by the overall mdf market and plant operating performance 
the largest market segment for mdf is furniture manufacturers 
however  the furniture market continues to receive pressure from imports 
the market for traditional mdf board began the year of seasonally strong and remained relatively stable when compared to the lumber market  as production volumes by producers remained in balance with consumption 
the demand for thin board  used in store fixtures and laminated flooring  was strong for the entire year 
del tin continues to produce a significant percentage of this thin board in its product mix and its strategy is to develop and grow market share for this product 
the demand for mdf in is expected to be slightly below that during  but would increase with any recovery in the housing market 

table of contents operationally  del tin fiber continued to make significant advances during  with a focus on raising the plant s uptime percentage and increasing the premium grade production percentage 
however  the cost structure of the plant was significantly affected by increases for raw material wood fiber and resin glue used in the manufacturing process 
the increase in wood fiber cost was due largely to a shortage of softwood residual wood chips as area lumber mills reduced production in reaction to lumber market conditions 
as they reduced production levels  the volume of residual by product chips produced decreased proportionately 
conversely  area paper mills  who are primary consumers for these chips  continued to operate at normal production levels 
as a result of this supply demand imbalance  available wood fiber brought premium prices for the entire year of del tin fiber had to compete with these paper mills for wood fiber for a significant portion of its raw material fiber needs  thus increasing its cost 
in addition  del tin fiber obtains much of its wood fiber supply from residual chips produced at deltic s waldo mill 
therefore  for the three month period that this sawmill was shut down due to the fire there  del tin fiber had to purchase an even larger volume of fiber in the open market at longer freight haul distances 
during  the resin glue utilized to bond mdf in the manufacturing process increased significantly in price due to substantial price increases in methanol  which is a raw material used in the manufacture of the resin glue 
for  wood fiber cost is expected to remain near current levels  while resin glue prices are projected to increase slightly 
manufacturers have been able to recover a portion of their raw materials cost through price increases 
while this raised average sales realizations  producers have actually incurred a decrease in operating margins over the past months 
this environment is projected to result in additional closure of production capacity  which could further improve sales prices received 
del tin fiber s efforts will be concentrated on further improvements in its hourly productivity level and other plant operating efficiencies  while making additional reductions in the plant s manufacturing cost structure where possible 
significant events on august   deltic amended its revolving credit agreement with suntrust bank and other banks whereby the unsecured and committed revolving credit facility was increased from million to million 
an option to request an increase in the amount of aggregate revolving commitments from million to million was reinstated 
the agreement  which was set to expire on september   was extended to september  the funds available through this agreement will enable the company to take full advantage of value added growth opportunities as they present themselves 
on march   the company entered into an agreement with american agcredit pca to amend and restate the terms of the company s series a senior notes notes in the principal amount of million 
under the new agreement  the notes are due and payable december  prior to the agreement  the notes would have become due on december   pursuant to a note purchase agreement effective december  the interest rate for the notes remains the same as under the agreement percent through december   and after that date the rate will be reduced to percent for the balance of the term of the notes 
on april   red development llc announced that it planned to purchase from deltic a site within chenal valley for the promenade at chenal  an upscale lifestyle shopping center 
after extensive efforts by both parties  the sale of acres of commercial property was closed on september  construction began on the shopping center in and is expected to be completed by late may the development of the promenade at chenal is strategic to chenal valley in that it is expected to further increase interest in the company s additional acres of commercially zoned property adjacent to the site 
on august   del tin fiber successfully refinanced its existing long term debt by entering into a credit agreement consisting of a letter of credit and term loan with multiple lending institutions pursuant to which  million of its million industrial revenue bonds were redeemed 
under the new credit agreement  the lenders  on september   loaned del tin fiber million  which will be repayable over five years in equal quarterly installments that began on december   and issued on del tin fiber s behalf  a letter of credit in the amount of million to support the remaining industrial revenue bonds originally issued in by union county  arkansas 
this refinancing resulted in more favorable credit terms for the joint venture 
the most 
table of contents notable was the removal of the remaining required bond sinking fund payments of million due in under the prior debt facility 
for additional information about the company s investment in del tin fiber  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
from the time production began at del tin fiber in until the fourth quarter of  both operating and financial performance was below the expectations established at the time that the decision to construct the plant was made 
as a result  on april   deltic announced that banc one capital markets  inc had been retained as financial advisor to assist in the evaluation of strategic alternatives for the company s investment in del tin fiber 
subsequently  deltic s management and board of directors completed its review of these strategic alternatives and announced the company intended to exit the mdf business upon the earliest  reasonable opportunity provided by the market 
as a result of this decision  the company s evaluation of possible impairment of the carrying value of its investment in the joint venture was based primarily upon the estimated cash flows from a possible sale of the company s interest during and resulted in a determination that the company s investment was impaired as of december  the investment was written off  to zero  and the write off amounted to million before income taxes 
due to the company s commitment to fund its share of any of the facility s operating working capital needs until the facility was able to consistently generate sufficient funds to meet its cash requirements or deltic s ownership was sold  the company recognized equity in del tin fiber equal to the extent of these advances during for the year of  such advances approximated the company s equity share of losses for the plant 
accordingly  the investment in del tin fiber at december  was zero 
the company also continued to utilize its management resources to work with del tin s management and the joint venture partner to improve operating performance at the plant 
as a result of these improvements  on december   deltic s board of directors revised its intent regarding the company s investment in del tin fiber and ceased efforts to sell the company s interest in the joint venture  while continuing to focus on improving operating and financial results of the plant 
due to this decision  the evaluation of fair value for the investment was based primarily upon the future net cash flows from del tin fiber s operations over the remaining life of the plant 
in  the company began recording its equity share of the operating results of the joint venture

actual results could differ materially from those included in such forward looking statements 
other matters impact of inflation general inflation has not had a significant effect on the company s operating results during the three years ended december  the company s timber operations are more significantly impacted by the forces of supply and demand in the southern united states than by changes in inflation 
lumber manufacturing operations are affected by the supply of lumber available in the north american market and by the demand for lumber by both the north american and foreign export markets 
sales of real estate are affected by changes in the general economy and long term interest rates  specifically as such may manifest themselves in the central arkansas region 
market risk market risk represents the potential loss resulting from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments  either derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity security prices 
the company handles market risks in accordance with its established policies  however  deltic does not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the company does  on occasion  consider the need to enter into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates  however  the company entered into no such instruments during the three year period ended december  deltic held various financial instruments at december  and  consisting of financial assets and liabilities reported in the company s consolidated balance sheets and off balance sheet exposures resulting from contractual debt guarantees and letters of credit issued for the benefit of deltic  primarily in connection with its purchased stumpage procurement and real estate operations 
for additional information regarding these financial instruments  refer to the previous tabular summary of the company s other commercial commitment expirations and to note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest rate risk the company is subject to interest rate risk from the utilization of financial instruments  such as term debt and other borrowings 
the fair market value of long term  fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and will decrease as interest rates rise 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the instruments fair value  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
the estimated fair values of the company s long term debt  including current maturities  contractual guarantees of debt  and letters of credit at december   were million  million  and 
million  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in prevailing interest rates would result in decreases in the estimated fair value of long term debt of million and contractual guarantees of debt of 
million  while the fair value of the company s letters of credit would be unchanged 
fair values were determined using the current rates at which the company could enter into comparable financial instruments with similar remaining maturities 
there was no impact for resulting from a one percentage point increase in interest rates on the estimated pretax earnings and cash flows  holding other variables constant 
foreign exchange rate risk the company currently has no exposure to foreign exchange rate risk because all of its financial instruments are denominated in us dollars 
commodity price risk the company has no financial instruments subject to commodity price risk 

table of contents equity security price risk none of the company s financial instruments have potential exposure to equity security price risk 
the preceding discussion of the company s estimated fair value of its financial instruments and the sensitivity analyses resulting from hypothetical changes in interest rates are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements reflect the company s current expectations and involve uncertainties 
these forward looking market risk disclosures are selective in nature and only address the potential impact from financial instruments 
they do not include other potential effects which could impact deltic s business as a result of changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  or equity security prices 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company has identified seven of its current accounting policies as being  in management s view  critical to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  six of these policies require significant assumptions and or estimates on the part of management as it pertains to certain factors inherent in the policies 
the company s senior management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies and estimates with the company s audit committee 
with the exception of the reduction of the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance in refer to note to the consolidated financial statements  deltic has not made any material changes to its critical accounting estimates in the last three years 
these policies  along with explanations of the key assumptions and or estimates considered by management  are described below 
for a listing of all significant accounting policies of the company  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
investment in real estate held for development and sale real estate held for development and sale is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value  and includes direct costs of land and land development and indirect costs  including amenities 
indirect and amenity costs are allocated to individual lots or acreage sold based on relative sales value 
direct costs are allocated on a specific neighborhood basis  while indirect costs for the company s four development areas chenal valley  chenal downs  red oak ridge  and the currently suspended the ridges at nowlin creek are allocated to neighborhoods over the entire respective development area based on relative retail values 
the key factors involved in determining the investment in real estate held for development and sale are the treatment of the clubhouse and golf course at chenal country club  the amenity around which the chenal valley development is centered  as an amenity rather than an operating fixed asset and the management estimates required to estimate the future indirect development costs and sales values of the areas of chenal valley yet to be developed 
due to accounting for chenal country club as an amenity  the cost of the clubhouse and golf course  including the estimated cost of planned future improvements  are charged against income as real estate is sold rather than depreciating this cost 
this amenity treatment also records the initiation fees received from members joining the club as a reduction in the cost basis of the club rather than as net sales 
in addition  the company s model for allocating the indirect cost to be expensed against each piece of real estate sold requires management to estimate the future indirect costs to be incurred for the entire development  primarily infrastructure costs and future improvements at chenal country club net of estimated future initiation fees to be received  as well as the potential market value of each tract of undeveloped property within the chenal valley development 
in determining future indirect development costs  management relies on cost projections for its development plans provided by independent professional engineering consultants 
independent appraisers are utilized to provide the potential market value for unsold acreage 
investment in del tin fiber investment in del tin fiber llc del tin fiber  a percent owned limited liability company  is carried at cost and is adjusted for the company s proportionate share of del tin fiber s undistributed earnings or losses 
the company s equity method basis carrying value for its investment in del tin fiber is evaluated for possible impairment  as applicable under the requirements of accounting principles board opinion apb  the equity 
table of contents method of accounting for investments in common stock 
this evaluation as of december   based on the intent of the company s board of directors to exit the business  resulted in a determination that the company s investment was impaired as of december   and the carrying amount of the investment was written off  to zero  for the consolidated balance sheet 
on december   the company s board of directors revised its intent in regard to selling deltic s interest in the joint venture 
the resulting evaluation of fair value for the related investment indicated that fair value exceeded carrying value  which was zero as of december   and the company resumed recording its equity share of the operating results of del tin fiber 
likewise  cash advances to the joint venture are recorded as increases in the company s investment in the facility  while cash distributions received from the joint venture are reflected as reductions in its investment 
for deltic s investment in del tin fiber  the key determinations by management are the accounting treatment for this investment under the equity method of accounting rather than as a consolidated subsidiary since the joint venture is percent owned by both owners  the factors used in evaluating the impairment of the investment s carrying value  and the estimate of the fair value of the company s guarantee of del tin fiber s credit agreement 
deltic management has determined that there is no control by either company due to having a board of managers with equal representation 
as such  the assets and liabilities of del tin fiber are not included in the amounts reported on the company s balance sheet for any period 
in evaluating the possibility of the existence of an impairment for the company s carrying value for its investment in del tin fiber under apb  management must estimate future net cash flows from the possible courses of action available for its investment  such as continuing to maintain or sell its investment  to determine both recoverability of the carrying amount and fair value of the investment 
more specifically  management must determine the possible courses of action and estimate the probability of each potential action  as well as the related future net cash flows 
then  if estimated fair value is less than the carrying amount  management must determine if this impairment is other than temporary 
if so  then an impairment write down is required 
in estimating the fair value of the guarantee of del tin fiber s credit agreement  deltic s management must first assess how the same debt instrument would have been structured without the guarantees of the joint venture partners  in order to estimate the benefit resulting from deltic s guarantee 
a range of probabilities of estimated future cash outflows under the benefit previously determined are then assembled 
a probability weighted present value of the estimated future cash outflows is then calculated 
the resulting balance represents the fair value of the obligation  which is the estimate of the value of assets required currently to settle the liability in the future

timber and timberlands timber and timberlands  which includes purchased stumpage inventory and logging facilities  is stated at acquisition cost less cost of fee timber harvested and accumulated depreciation of logging facilities 
the cost of fee timber harvested is based on the volume of timber harvested in relation to the estimated volume of timber recoverable 
logging facilities  which consist primarily of roads constructed and other land improvements  are depreciated using the straight line method over a ten year estimated life 
the company s professional foresters estimate its fee timber inventory using statistical information and data obtained from physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
the cost of timber and timberland purchased and reforestation costs are capitalized 
fee timber carrying costs are expensed as incurred 
the key components of the timber and timberlands policy are management s decision to maintain separate timber cost pools for each legal entity within the deltic consolidated group and the required estimation of timber inventory volume  by species  for each of these companies in order to calculate the cost of fee timber harvested per ton 
management has elected to maintain a separate cost pool for the timber owned by each company  thus resulting in a different cost per ton for fee timber harvested for each 
the mix of harvest by company for any period can significantly affect the amount of cost of 
table of contents fee timber harvested expense reported 
per ton costs for ranged from to per ton for pine sawtimber 
had the company opted to use a composite depletion rate  cost of pine sawtimber harvested would have been the same in  
million more in  and 
million more in zero  
million  and 
million  respectively  net of applicable income taxes than as reported due to the mix of harvest by company during the year 
in determining these rates  management must estimate the volume of timber existing on its timberlands 
to estimate these fee timber inventories  the company relies on its experienced forestry personnel and their use of statistical information and data obtained by actual physical measurements and other information gathering techniques 
the recognized cost of fee timber harvested is impacted by the accuracy of this volume estimation 
for additional information about the company s timber and timberlands  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
property  plant  and equipment property  plant  and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation of buildings  equipment  and other depreciable assets is primarily determined using the straight line method 
expenditures that substantially improve and or increase the useful life of facilities or equipment are capitalized 
maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred 
gains and losses on disposals or retirements are included in income as they occur 
property  plant  and equipment assets are evaluated for possible impairment on a specific asset basis or in groups of similar assets  as applicable  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and depreciation ceases 
management also evaluates any asset or group of assets for which potential impairment might exist and has determined that there are none requiring an impairment write down 
this process requires management s estimate of future cash flows generated by each asset or group of assets 
for any instance where this evaluation process might indicate an impairment exists  the appropriate asset s carrying values would be written down to fair value and the amount of the write down would be charged against the results of continuing operations

income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  the provision for income taxes includes amounts currently payable and amounts deferred as tax assets and liabilities  based on differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities  and is measured using the enacted tax rates that are assumed will be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance which is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the key management decisions related to income taxes are the determination of current taxability of transactions  the election to capitalize or expense costs incurred  the decision regarding the appropriate depreciation method for income tax purposes these three factors ultimately affect the company s cash flows for income taxes paid and determine 
table of contents the differences between the financial statements carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities  and management s estimation of the appropriateness of valuation allowances to reduce any deferred tax assets that exist 
deltic s management periodically evaluates the company s ability to realize future benefit of deferred tax assets by reviewing the expected turnaround of deferred tax liabilities and the amount of future taxable income and by evaluating tax planning strategies that could possibly be implemented to realize deferred tax assets 
the company maintains liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits for various uncertain tax positions taken in our tax return
