item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those contained in the discussion on forward looking statements below and those contained elsewhere in this report 
overview we operate our business in two segments early stage and late stage 
our early stage segment consists primarily of our phase i clinical trial services and our bioanalytical laboratory services  including early clinical pharmacology 
our late stage segment consists primarily of phase ii through phase iv clinical trial services and a comprehensive array of related services  including data management and biostatistics  medical and scientific affairs  regulatory affairs and clinical information technology and consulting services 
for additional information about segments  see note m to the consolidated financial statements 
during  we discontinued operations at our miami and ft 
myers facilities 
all financial results in this report reflect our continuing operations only  unless otherwise stated 
in addition  we have made certain reclassifications  primarily related to rent escalation clauses  lessor incentives and certain payroll related costs to conform to the late stage segment presentation and certain tax liabilities  to the and financial information to conform with the presentation 
our net revenue consists primarily of fees earned for services performed under contracts with branded pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical device and generic drug company clients 
a portion of our contract fee is generally due upon signing of the contract  and the majority of the contract fee is then paid in installments upon the achievement of certain agreed upon performance milestones 
relative to our early stage contracts  our late stage contracts are generally larger and longer in duration  and our late stage 
table of contents segment typically receives larger advance payments 
our contracts are generally terminable immediately or after a specified period following notice by the client 
these contracts usually require payment to us of expenses to wind down a study and fees earned to date 
most of the contracts in our early stage segment are of short duration  however  our late stage segment typically performs services under long term contracts  which are subject to a greater risk of delay or cancellation 
in our late stage business  we report revenue line items consisting of direct revenue and reimbursed out of pocket expenses  together with an expense line item for reimbursable out of pocket expenses  which consist of travel and other expenses that are reimbursed by our clients 
we record our recurring operating expenses in three primary categories i direct costs  ii selling  general and administrative expenses and iii reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
direct costs consist primarily of participant fees and associated expenses  direct labor and employee benefits  facility costs  depreciation associated with facilities and equipment used in conducting trials and other costs and materials directly related to contracts 
direct costs as a percentage of net revenue vary from period to period due primarily to the varying mix of contracts and services performed and to the percentage of revenues arising from our early stage operations  which generally have higher direct costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of administrative payroll  except for the late stage segment  overhead  advertising  legal and accounting expenses  travel  depreciation and amortization of intangibles 
the late stage segment includes all payroll related costs as part of direct costs  and all office costs and depreciation as part of selling  general and administrative expenses 
the gross profit margins on our contracts vary depending upon the nature of the services we perform for our clients 
gross profit margins for our early stage segment generally tend to be higher than those for our late stage segment and other services we perform 
within our early stage segment  our gross profit margins are generally higher for trials that involve a larger number of participants  a longer period of study time or the performance of more tests 
gross profit margins for our services to branded drug clients generally tend to be higher than those for generic drug clients 
in addition  our gross profit margins vary based upon our mix of domestic and international business 
gross profit margins are calculated by dividing gross profit direct revenue less direct costs by direct revenue 
critical accounting estimates we make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses for the applicable period ended date 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions which are based on historical experience and other factors we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates and our actual results are subject to the risk factors contained in item a of this report 
management believes that the following items involve a high degree of judgment or complexity revenue and cost recognition 
the majority of our revenues are recorded from contracts on a proportional performance basis 
to measure performance on a given date  we compare effort expended through that date to estimated total effort to complete the contract 
historically  a majority of our direct revenue has been earned under contracts which range in duration from a few weeks to years 
in the late stage business  the average contract is approximately two and a half years  but can be many more years 
service contracts generally take the form of fee for service or fixed price arrangements 
in the case of fee for service contracts  revenue is recognized as services are performed based upon  for example  hours worked or samples tested 
for long term  fixed price service contracts  revenue is recognized as services are performed  with performance generally assessed using output measures such as units of work performed to date compared with total units of work contracted 
changes in the scope of work generally result in a renegotiation of the contract price 
renegotiated amounts are not included in revenue until earned and realization is assured 
estimates of costs to complete are made to provide  where appropriate  for losses expected on contracts 
costs are not deferred in anticipation of contracts being awarded  but instead are expensed as incurred 
in some cases  a portion of the contract fee is paid at the time the trial is initiated 
these advances are deferred and recognized as revenue as services are performed or products are delivered  as discussed above 
additional payments may be made based upon the achievement of performance based milestones over the contract duration 
most contracts are terminable by the client either immediately or upon notice 
these contracts typically require payment to us of expenses to wind down the study and fees earned to date 
direct costs include all direct costs related to contract performance and  in some cases  all payroll related costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses are charged to expense as they are incurred 
changes in job performance and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
due to the inherent uncertainties in estimating costs  it is possible that the estimates used will change in the near term and that the change could be material 
the uncertainties which can affect our estimates include changes in scope of contracts and unforeseen costs which cannot be 
table of contents billed to the client  such as increased costs associated with recruiting special populations for studies 
our estimates of these uncertainties have not materially affected our revenue or cost recognition  and we do not anticipate making material changes to our method of estimating costs in the future 
as described above  pass through costs are included in revenue and direct costs and are reimbursed by our clients 
accounts receivable include unbilled amounts which represent revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed 
collectibility of accounts receivable 
we base our allowance for doubtful accounts on management s estimates of the creditworthiness of our clients  analysis of delinquent accounts  the payment histories of the accounts and management s judgment with respect to current economic conditions 
we believe the allowances are sufficient to respond to normal business conditions 
we review our accounts receivable aging on a regular basis for past due accounts and we write off any uncollectible amounts against the allowance 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on historic collectibility and specific identification of potential problem accounts 
should business conditions deteriorate or any major client default on its obligations to us  we may need to significantly increase this allowance  which would have a negative impact on our operations 
income taxes 
developing the provision for income taxes requires significant management judgment  including the determination of foreign tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate our ability to realize deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of our valuation allowance if necessary 
we maintain offices in many countries and we are subject to audit in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate 
due to the complex issues involved  any claims can require an extended period of time to resolve 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 
our consolidated balance sheets reflect certain valuation allowances related to certain us operating losses and our ability to realize foreign tax loss carryforwards and research tax credits in canada carried forward and earned in the current year 
if the estimates utilized to establish the valuation allowance prove inaccurate  resulting increases or decreases in the valuation allowance could be required 
any future changes in valuation allowance could have a material impact on our net earnings 
as of december   based on estimates of future taxable profits and losses in certain foreign tax jurisdictions  we have recorded a valuation allowance of million for specific foreign entities and we have recorded a valuation allowance of million for us entities 
we have been  and we may continue to be  a party to foreign tax proceedings 
we have established an estimated income tax reserve to provide for potential adverse outcomes in future tax proceedings  which would have an impact on the amount of goodwill reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
also  if our estimates prove to be inadequate  any future foreign tax proceedings could have an impact on our results of operations 
it is possible that changes in our estimates could cause us to either materially increase or decrease the amount of our income tax reserve 
with regard to earnings from foreign operations  our policy is to retain such earnings in the country in which they were generated unless they can be repatriated without significant tax consequences 
this permits us to reduce accruing or recognizing as additional tax expense the material us income tax liabilities which would arise upon repatriation of these earnings 
goodwill 
on an annual basis  we assess the composition of our assets and liabilities and the events that have occurred and the circumstances that have changed since the most recent fair value determination  which is based on discounted cash flows 
if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of goodwill below its carrying amount  goodwill is tested for impairment 
we recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the fair value determination 
impairment of assets 
we review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the fair value and future benefits of intangible assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets over the remaining amortization period 
we recognize an impairment charge if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the expected future cash flows 
share based compensation 
we have granted stock options to our employees at exercise prices equal to or greater than the fair value of the shares at the date of grant 
our plans also provide for the granting of restricted shares  restricted stock units and other forms of equity compensation in addition to stock options 
recognition of compensation expense requires the use of estimates related to expected employee exercise  expected post vesting employment termination behavior and the expected volatility of the price of the underlying stock 
actual results could differ from our estimates 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth our results of operations both numerically and as a percentage of direct revenue for and in thousands  except per share data direct revenue direct costs selling  general and administrative expenses provision for settlement of litigation impairment of goodwill total other expense earnings from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit earnings from continuing operations before minority interest in joint venture minority interest in joint venture net earnings from continuing operations earnings loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net earnings loss earnings per share from continuing operations basic diluted direct revenue direct revenue  which does not include reimbursed out of pocket expenses  was million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to growth in both segments  with early stage contributing and late stage of direct revenues in direct revenue in the early stage segment was million for the year ended december   compared to million in this increase of is primarily attributable to higher direct revenue in the laboratories and clinics and a favorable foreign currency exchange  or fx  impact of million 
the performance of our bioanalytical laboratories was strong  with sample volumes up in compared to the prior year 
direct revenue in the late stage segment was million for the year ended december   compared to million in this increase of is the result of the late stage segment performing more clinical activity compared to the prior year 
in addition  the late stage segment benefited from a favorable fx impact of million in for the year ended december   direct revenue was million from us operations and million from foreign operations compared to million from us operations and million from foreign operations in direct costs direct costs increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
for the year ended december   direct costs as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly to from in this decrease is attributable to slight decreases in the both the early stage and late stage segments 
increased direct costs in the early stage segment are primarily due to new facilities in quebec city and toronto 
increased costs in the late stage segment are primarily attributable to our investments in personnel and is consistent with our worldwide strategy to be competitive for the large global programs 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of depreciation expense in direct costs compared to million in gross profit gross profit margins as a percentage of direct revenue for the year ended december   increased to from for the prior year 
gross profit margins were negatively impacted by percentage points by foreign currency 
since we perform a wide variety of services  all of which have different gross margins  our margins vary from quarter to quarter and year to year based upon the mix of contracts  our capacity levels at the time we begin the projects and the amount of revenue generated for each type of service 
table of contents we perform 
even within category types  gross margins generated may vary due to the unique nature and size of each contract and project we undertake 
these factors could impact our future profit margins and profit comparisons to historical levels 
during the year ended december   the early stage segment had higher than expected direct costs  however  these increased costs were offset by higher revenue which resulted in slightly increased profit margins compared to the prior year 
a number of clinical projects were either rescheduled  postponed or cancelled during the latter part of the fourth quarter of our clinics were staffed to run these studies and when the projects were postponed to subsequent quarters  the clinics operated at a lower than expected utilization level  which negatively impacted the segment s margins 
we believe these shifts in project timing are temporary  and we believe there has not been a systemic change in market conditions that would impact continued growth of direct revenue in the early stage segment  which was in excess of for the year 
profit margins in the late stage segment remained relatively flat at approximately as utilization levels have not reached their fullest potential 
in january  we announced the acquisition of certain assets of princeton bioanalytical laboratory  llc  including laboratory equipment and procedural documentation 
with the development of the new laboratory  we will add macromolecule analysis capabilities to our existing small molecule services 
in addition  the acquisition also enables us to initiate method development and production enhancements in our ligand binding laboratory in canada 
we are currently considering a joint initiative with a third party to enter into the clinical trial materials  or ctm  industry 
with the rapid growth of the ctm industry and few barriers of entry  we believe that this venture will enable us to provide the specialized  high level service this industry demands 
our services offered will include package design  manufacturing  return drug processing and destruction in accordance with our client s specific clinical trial protocol 
we expect to leverage from our existing client relationships and services and employ highly experienced staff in order to offer the full suite of packaging and labeling services in the us  along with storage and distribution capabilities in europe 
this venture  if executed  is expected to have a dilutive impact on our earnings 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses increased to million  an increase of  for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
as a percentage of direct revenue  sg a expenses decreased to in from in the increase in total sg a expenses from to is primarily attributable to additional expenditures consistent with the expansion of our business  including additional administrative and other personnel costs  health and casualty insurance  increased sales  marketing and business development efforts and facility costs related to the move in to new quebec city and toronto facilities 
moving costs to the quebec city facility were million for the year ended december  we expect sg a expenses to decrease overall in fiscal year as we implement cost reduction strategies 
corporate sg a expenses for the year ended december   excluding million for the provision for the settlement of the securities and class action lawsuit and other related litigation  were million compared to million in this increase of million is attributed to million of executive severance  million in compensation related costs  million in professional fees and million of facilities expenses  offset by a decrease in legal fees related to the sec investigation  which were million in compared to million in for the year ended december   depreciation expense of million was included in sg a expenses compared to million in provision for settlement of litigation for the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million for the settlement of the securities class action lawsuit and other related litigation 
the current liability for these actions is an estimate 
on march   the court approved the securities class action settlement 
we continue to work on the derivative action litigation 
for further discussion regarding these matters  see item of this report and note g to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income and interest expense interest expense decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million in this decrease is primarily attributable to a reduction of interest expense on our line of credit due to substantially lower loan balances offset by higher interest rates  and due to a reduction in write offs of deferred financing cost from the restructuring of the credit facility and the size of the line of credit 
in may  we agreed to permanently reduce the size of the credit facility from million to million 
as a result of this reduction  we wrote off million of deferred financing costs related to the credit facility in the second quarter of 
table of contents as of december   the balance outstanding on our credit facility was zero 
the current interest rate on this variable facility is on the revolving line of credit  excluding interest expense related to the unused borrowing capacity on the line 
the deferred financing costs relating to the convertible notes are being amortized to interest expense over a period of three years  and relating to the credit facility over a period of four years 
interest income for the year ended december   was million compared to million in this increase is primarily attributable to higher interest rates available on cash balances and investments and slightly higher average cash balances during compared to we expect interest income to decrease in the future as a result of lower interest rates and our conservative investment approach 
foreign currency exchange transactions we do not enter in currency transactions with the intent of speculating or trading 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting in the consolidated financial statements 
our foreign subsidiaries translate their financial results from local currency into us dollars in the following manner a income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  b balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and c equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation in this manner affects the shareholders equity account referred to as the foreign currency translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiary s us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep in agreement the foreign subsidiaries balance sheets 
if foreign exchange rates remained at the year end spot exchange rate for translation  early stage revenues would have been reduced by million when translated into us dollars  and late stage revenues would have been reduced by million when translated into us dollars 
similarly  early stage direct costs would have been reduced by million and late stage direct costs would have been reduced by million 
further  sg a expenses for early stage would have been reduced by million and late stage would have been reduced by million 
the net effect on earnings from operations from translation of functional currency to reporting currency was a loss of million in both the early stage and the late stage 
foreign currency exchange transaction losses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million in these losses were due to the us dollar weakening approximately against the canadian dollar  against the euro and against the swiss franc during within our early stage segment operating in canada  essentially all costs are in canadian dollars  while a significant portion of direct revenue is either in us dollars or euros 
similarly  in the late stage segment in europe  costs are primarily in euros and swiss francs  while a significant portion of direct revenue is in us dollars 
during the year ended december   we entered into foreign currency transactions to hedge exposure related to receivables denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
we did not elect to apply hedge accounting for these transactions 
income taxes our effective tax rate for was an expense of compared to a benefit of in the effective tax rate for included the impact of recording a valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets relating to federal and state operating loss carryforwards and an allowance of million relating to canadian federal tax credit carryforwards 
the effective tax rate included the benefit of utilizing million of the us federal loss carryforward and the benefit associated with a million increase in the value of the net deferred tax asset relating to canadian taxes 
this result was primarily attributable to certain discrete items  a shift in the proportion of earnings from domestic and foreign operations and our estimate of the future value of the canadian tax credits 
as of december   we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards of million  state net operating loss carryforwards of million and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of million that are available to offset future liabilities for income taxes 
we maintain a valuation allowance against these carryforwards  net of available carryback claims  based on an assessment that it is more likely than not that these benefits will not be realized 
the us net operating loss carryforward is subject to limitation under internal revenue code and will expire in the state net operating losses will begin to expire in and the foreign net operating losses began to expire in we receive significant tax credits from the government of canada relating to our research and development expenses 
as of december   the total gross balance of deferred tax assets was million 
these credits and tax assets lowered our tax liability in canada 
we expect the nature of our early stage business and the generation of significant tax credits will continue  however  we cannot be assured of the future amount of these credits due to the mix of contracts and the related amounts of research and development activity 
further  we have provided a valuation allowance of million against certain of these credits as the amount of credits earned currently exceeds projected taxable income in canada for which such credits can be used to reduce taxes 

table of contents our late stage entity  pharmanet  generates a significant portion of its net earnings from foreign operations 
its non us and non canadian operations are based in zurich  switzerland  where the effective tax rate is approximately 
the swiss office subcontracts work to the non us and non canadian pharmanet offices 
fees are based on a reimbursement to these offices of their operating costs  plus a fair markup based on appropriate transfer pricing comparables 
the residual income in these non us and non canadian offices is taxed at statutory rates which range from to 
we have elected to permanently reinvest earnings and profits related to foreign subsidiaries  accordingly  no provision has been recorded for us income taxes that might result from repatriation of these earnings 
the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries as of december   were million 
we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 or fin  effective january  upon adoption  we recognized the cumulative effect of the change in accounting as a reduction in retained earnings of million  which together with a previously existing income tax liability of million resulted in a total liability for unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of million related to us and foreign operations 
as of december   the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes  reported in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets  was million 
any prospective adjustments to reserves for income taxes will be recorded as an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes and will impact our effective tax rate 
in addition  we accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in the provision for income taxes and we record any associated penalties in other income expense 
the gross amount of interest accrued  reported in other liabilities  was million as of december   of which million was recognized in we remain subject to potential examination in federal  state and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct operations and file tax returns 
we believe that the results of the current or any prospective audits will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations as adequate reserves have been provided to cover any potential exposures related to these audits 
in  the net increase in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits was million  which principally related to an increase in certain canadian tax liabilities 
we expect that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change during fiscal year  however  we do not expect the change to have a significant impact on our results of operations or financial position 
we operate in the us and in numerous taxing jurisdictions worldwide  many with lower tax rates than the us we expect i the nature of anapharm s business and the generation of canadian tax credits to continue and ii pharmanet to continue generating the majority of its profits in taxing jurisdictions with lower effective tax rates 
as discussed above  we also have valuation allowances against certain material deferred tax assets 
hence  we cannot be certain that the changes in the operating income of our operations  shifts in the location of the performance of work or other expected factors such as fin will not adversely impact the effective tax rate 
our future effective tax rate is also dependent on a number of other factors  including the relative profits generated primarily in the us  canada and europe  our ability to utilize canadian tax credits  the applicable foreign tax rates in effect  transfer pricing  and our ability to generate us taxable income to utilize net operating loss carryovers and thereby decrease the valuation allowance 

table of contents earnings per share the weighted average number of shares outstanding used in computing earnings per share on a diluted basis increased to million shares for the year ended december   from million shares in this increase resulted primarily from stock option exercises and the issuance of restricted shares and restricted stock units 
as discussed in note f to the consolidated financial statements  if our average common stock price exceeds during a reporting period  we will be required to include additional shares in calculating the weighted average number of diluted shares due to our convertible notes 
the amount of additional shares will be calculated comparable to the treasury method used for in the money stock options 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth our results of operations both numerically and as a percentage of direct revenue for and in thousands  except per share data direct revenue direct costs selling  general and administrative expenses impairment of goodwill total other income expense earnings from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit earnings from continuing operations before minority interest in joint venture minority interest in joint venture net earnings from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net earnings loss earnings per share from continuing operations basic diluted direct revenue direct revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of from million for the year ended december  this increase is attributable to a increase in revenue in our late stage business  partially offset by a decrease of in our early stage business 
direct revenue for the early stage operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million in this decrease of is primarily due to a decline in revenues at our early stage canadian operations  partially offset by an increase in revenue at our us and european bioanalytical laboratories 
in  we began experiencing severe price competition at our canadian subsidiary which comprises about of our early stage segment revenues 
during the second half of  this price pressure mitigated slightly 
the reduction in price pressure along with internal process improvements resulted in improved performance in our canadian operations in the second half of direct revenue in the late stage business increased in compared to primarily due to performing more clinical trials 
for the year ended december   direct revenue was million from us operations and million from foreign operations compared to million from us operations and million from foreign operations in this increase is primarily due to a significant increase in revenues in our late stage business  partially offset by a decrease in our early stage business 
direct costs for the year ended december   direct costs as a percentage of revenue increased to from in the increase is primarily related to the early stage operations 
during  we experienced a shift in business at our canadian operations to more clinical work compared to bioanalytical work as a percentage of overall business 
direct costs as a percentage of revenue are higher in clinical operations than in bioanalytical operations 
direct costs  which are comprised primarily of labor costs for the early stage segment  were significantly higher as a percentage of revenue than expected due to lower than expected revenues 

table of contents during  our early stage business experienced more pricing pressure in both the clinical and bioanalytical operations as a result of industry competition in the generic market 
both of these factors increased the early stage business s direct costs as a percentage of revenue 
the early stage business historically has experienced periods of competition 
however  in the second half of  we determined that the pricing pressures in the generic business would continue for the foreseeable future and that a change in our business model was required 
as a result of this determination  in september  we began implementing steps to reduce both direct and other costs in the early stage segment 
these steps included reduction of personnel through attrition  process changes to improve efficiencies  reduced reliance on outside contractors and other cost reductions 
these reductions contributed to improved operating results in the early stage segment during the fourth quarter of gross profit gross profit margins as a percentage of direct revenue for the year ended december   decreased to from for the prior year 
since we perform a wide variety of services  all of which have different gross margins  our margins vary from quarter to quarter and year to year based upon the mix of contracts  our capacity levels at the time we begin the projects and the amount of revenue generated for each type of service we perform 
even within category types  gross margins generated may vary due to the unique nature and size of each contract and project we undertake 
this could impact our future profit margins and profit comparisons to historical levels 
during the year ended december   the early stage segment had higher than expected direct costs resulting in lower profit margins than historic levels 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of  compared to million for the prior year 
as a percentage of direct revenue  sg a expenses increased to in from in the increase in total sg a expenses from to is primarily attributable to significantly increased corporate expenses and other expenses consistent with the growth in revenues 
the increase in sg a expense as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to lower than expected revenue growth in the early stage business and an increase in corporate expenses 
in  corporate expenses increased million to million compared to million in these increases are primarily due to additional professional  legal and accounting fees of million  non cash compensation expense resulting from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
r of million  amortization of restricted stock units of million and additional insurance  travel expense and salaries totaling million 
for the year ended december   we incurred million in rent expense for the toronto facility which was undergoing its initial fit out 
other sg a expenses increased due to expansion of our business  including additional administrative and other personnel costs  health and casualty insurance  increased sales  marketing and business development efforts  amortization and depreciation expense and facility costs 
for the year ended december   amortization expense was million compared to million in depreciation expense was million in compared to million in interest income and interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million in this decrease is primarily due to a reduction in interest expense on our line of credit due to lower outstanding balances offset by higher interest rates and to a reduction in write offs of deferred financing cost due to restructuring of the credit facility and the size of line of credit 
in  we incurred a non cash write off of million related to deferred financing costs due to repayment of million on the term loan and conversion of the remaining term loan to a revolving line of credit of million 
in  we agreed to a reduction in the line of credit from million to million and  as a result  we wrote off million of deferred financing costs 
interest income for the year ended december   was million compared to million in this increase is primarily due to increased cash balances and higher interest rates on cash invested 
foreign currency exchange transactions our foreign exchange loss was million for the year ended december   compared to million for this increase is primarily due to the significant strengthening of the euro against the us dollar in compared to 
table of contents income taxes our effective tax rate for was a benefit of compared to an expense of in this change was primarily due to a greater percentage of earnings generated from foreign operations relative to our consolidated earnings 
the effective tax rate from us operations is substantially greater than our effective tax rate in canada and several key european countries 
as described above  we receive significant tax credits from the government of canada relating to our research and development expenses 
these credits lower our effective tax rate in canada and in other countries where we operate 
for the year ended december   we generated significant us net operating losses 
we believe it is unlikely that the losses will be realized before the tax benefits expire 
in  a valuation allowance of million was provided for us net operating loss carryforwards 
effects of inflation our business and operations have not been materially affected by inflation during the periods for which financial information is presented in this report 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled million and working capital  excluding the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations  was million  compared to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and working capital  excluding the assets and liabilities from discontinued operations of million as of december  for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million compared to million for the prior year 
this increase is primarily due to increases in net earnings of million  a non cash provision for settlement of litigation of million and operating liabilities of million  partially offset by decreases in a non cash goodwill impairment of million and operating assets of million 
for the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was million compared to million for the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to decreases in marketable securities of million and property in a sale leaseback transaction of million 
for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was million compared to net cash provided of million for the prior year 
the change in cash provided by financing activities is primarily due to a net increase in payments on our credit facility of million and a decrease of million of proceeds from the sale leaseback transaction  which represented a cash reimbursement of cash outlays upon entering into the transaction 
we have a million credit facility with a syndicate of banks that originated in the credit facility was subsequently amended three times before we entered into a fourth amendment on october   that substantially modified certain financial covenants and conditions in the credit facility to reflect our then current operations and business needs 
the material terms of the amendment i required us to provide the bank as defined with additional financial reporting  ii permitted us to enter into a sale leaseback transaction for our quebec city facility  and iii would require a temporary reduction in the amount of borrowing capacity under the credit facility to million in the event our trailing twelve month ebitda as defined is materially below  by a certain percentage  the forecasts we provide to the bank 
if the total amount of our outstanding loans exceeds million at the time of the occurrence of such an event  we have no immediate obligation to repay these loans 
if the trailing twelve month ebitda exceeds this threshold in future periods  the full borrowing capacity of the credit facility would be restored to million 
in conjunction with this amendment  the applicable margin as defined with respect to libor loans was increased by basis points to and the applicable margin with respect to revolving loans that are prime rate loans was increased by basis points to  subject to change based upon certain leverage ratios 
on june   we entered into a fifth amendment of the credit facility 
this amendment modified our financial reporting requirements to the bank but had no impact on the covenants or borrowing capacity available to us 
on march   we entered into a sixth amendment of the credit facility 
this amendment modified certain provisions to enable us to make certain investments and acquisitions 
as of december   the principal balance outstanding on the credit facility was zero 
as of december   the principal balance outstanding on the credit facility was million 
we are in compliance with the covenants and conditions of the credit facility as of december  the obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by each of our us subsidiaries  are secured by a lien on the vacant land in miami  florida  a pledge of all of the assets of our us operations and us subsidiaries and a 
table of contents pledge of of the stock of certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
the facility is due in december as of december   the us assets collateralizing the credit facility were valued at million  including goodwill and intangible assets 
we have issued and outstanding million principal amount of convertible senior notes due  or the notes 
the notes are unsecured senior obligations and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured indebtedness  and to all existing and future liabilities of subsidiaries  including trade payables 
we capitalized all costs related to the issuance of the notes in and have been amortizing these costs on a straight line basis over the expected term  which approximates the effective interest method 
interest is payable in arrears semi annually on february and august of each year 
the notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity into cash and  if applicable  shares of common stock based upon an initial conversion rate of shares per  in principal amount  or an initial conversion price of per share 
subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  the maximum number of shares that can be issued upon conversion is million 
upon conversion  holders of the notes will be entitled to receive cash up to the principal amount and  if applicable  shares of common stock pursuant to a formula contained in the indenture 
on each of august   and  holders may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
on or after august   we may  at our option  redeem the notes in whole or in part for cash at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest 
if a majority of the holders require us to repurchase their outstanding notes  we may have to seek additional financing  depending on the amount of the notes to be repurchased and the amount of cash or other liquid assets available at that time 
a significant component of our business strategy has been to seek acquisitions that are accretive to earnings and meet certain operational requirements 
we also consider other strategic initiatives which may include joint ventures and business development 
although we continue to assess potential acquisitions and business development opportunities  our primary focus has been on current operations 
if we consummate any acquisitions  we expect to use cash  equity and our existing credit facility to the extent available and  if necessary  to obtain additional debt or equity financing if these sources are not sufficient 
based upon our cash balances and cash flows from operations  we believe we have adequate working capital to meet our operational needs for the next months 
in order to provide a liquidity metric that enables investors to benchmark us against others in the industry  we calculate days sales outstanding  or dso  for each period for continuing operations 
dso is calculated by taking the consolidated accounts receivable balance for continuing operations at the end of a period and subtracting both short term and long term client advances for continuing operations at the end of the period 
the resulting number is divided by average net revenue per calendar day for continuing operations for the period 
as of december   our dso was days  compared to days as of december  the increase in dso in compared to is primarily due to the early stage segment where accounts receivable  net of client advances  increased million over the prior year

 or sfas sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the non controlling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  sfas requires the recognition of a non controlling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the non controlling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement

in addition  sfas requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the non controlling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its non controlling interest

for more information regarding some of the ongoing risks and uncertainties of our business  see the risk factors section of this report and our other filings with the sec 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with market rates and prices  interest rates and credit in the ordinary course of business 
we are also exposed to currency risk due to our foreign operations 
our financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  accounts receivable  accounts payable  convertible senior notes and notes payable 
as of december   the fair value of these instruments approximated their carrying amounts  except for the convertible senior notes which were at of par value based on the market trading price on that date 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
market risk we have invested in marketable securities  which we classify as available for sale and carry at fair value based on quoted market prices 
we are exposed to adverse changes in the market value of such securities while held by us  however  during the years ended december  through  unrealized holding losses have been insignificant 
as of december   we had million of investments in marketable securities and as of december   we had million of investments in marketable securities 

table of contents financial instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk consist primarily of trade receivable  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we perform services and extend credit based on an evaluation of the client s financial condition without requiring collateral 
exposure to losses on receivables varies by client based on the financial condition of each client 
we monitor exposure to credit losses and maintain allowances for anticipated losses considered necessary under the circumstances 
from time to time  we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in amounts that exceed federally insured limits 
to mitigate these risks  we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions 
currency risk we operate on a global basis which exposes us to various types of currency risks 
from time to time  contracts may be denominated in a currency different from the local currency 
two specific transaction risks arise from the nature of the contracts we have with our customers 
the first risk occurs as revenue recognized for services rendered is denominated in a currency different from the currency in which our expenses are incurred 
as a result  our net service revenues and resulting net earnings or loss can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the second risk results from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under these contracts and the ultimate collection of payments against such invoices 
because the contract may be denominated in a currency other than the local currency  we recognize a receivable at the time of invoicing in the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared until the payment is received from the customer will result in our receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount 
this difference is recognized as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and is reported in other income expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting in the consolidated financial statements 
our foreign subsidiaries translate their financial results from the local currency into us dollars in the following manner a income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  b balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and c equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation in this manner affects the shareholders equity account referred to as the foreign currency translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiaries us dollar balance sheets and is necessary to keep the foreign subsidiaries balance sheets in agreement 
we have adopted a foreign currency risk hedging policy and we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate this risk 
we have implemented systems and processes to further mitigate this risk  however we continue to be affected by foreign currency exchange volatility 
interest rate risk we have a million credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
the interest rate on the facility is variable and is based on libor and prime rate 
changes in interest rates  and libor and the prime rate in particular  affect our cost of funds under this facility 
as of december   the outstanding principal balance on the credit facility was zero
