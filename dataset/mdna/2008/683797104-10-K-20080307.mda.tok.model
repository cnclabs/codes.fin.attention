item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which appear elsewhere in this annual report 
the company engages in a broad range of activities in the securities industry  including retail securities brokerage  institutional sales and trading  investment banking both corporate and public finance  research  market making  and investment advisory and asset management services 
its principal subsidiaries are oppenheimer and oam 
as at december   the company provided its services from offices in states located throughout the united states and conducted business in offices in latin america through local broker dealers 
client assets entrusted to the company as at december  totaled approximately billion 
the company provides investment advisory services through oam and oim and oppenheimer s fahnestock asset management and omega group divisions 
the company provides trust services and products through oppenheimer trust company 
the company provides discoun t brokerage services through freedom and through buyandhold  a division of freedom

at december   the company employed approximately  people full time  of whom approximately  were registered personnel  including approximately  financial advisors 
these numbers changed effective january  with the acquisition of the new capital markets business described under item  business 
critical accounting estimates the company s accounting policies are essential to understanding and interpreting the financial results reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements are summarized in note to those statements 
certain of those policies are considered to be particularly important to the presentation of the company s financial results because they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following is a discussion of these policies 
financial instruments the company s financial instruments are generally short term in nature or have variable interest rates and as such their carrying values approximate fair value  with the exception of notes receivable from employees  which are carried at cost 
where available  the company uses prices from independent sources such as listed market prices  or broker or dealer price quotations 
in addition  even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
for instance  the company generally assumes that the size of positions in securities that the company holds would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if the company were to sell them  and that any such sale would happen in an or derly manner 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value 
securities owned  including those pledged and securities sold  but not yet purchased are recorded at estimated fair value on the consolidated balance sheet using quoted market or dealer prices  where available 
gains and losses are recorded in principal transactions on the consolidated statements of income 
investments  included in securities owned  which have a ready market are valued using quoted market or dealer prices 
investments with no ready market value are stated at estimated fair value as determined in good faith by management 
factors considered in valuing individual investments include available market prices  type of security  purchase price  purchases of the same or similar securities by other investors  marketability  restrictions on disposition  current financial position and operating results of the issuer  and other pertinent information 
management uses its best judgment in estimating the fair value of these investments 
there are inherent limitations in any estimation technique 
the fair value estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of an amount that the company could realize in a current transaction 
because of inherent uncertainty of valuation  these estimated fair values do not necessarily represent amounts that might be ultimately realized  since such amounts depend on future circumstances and the differences could be material 
financial instruments used for asset and liability management are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value based upon dealer quotes and third party pricing services 
the company utilizes interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk of its variable rate senior secured credit note 
these swaps have been designated as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
changes in the fair value of the swap hedges are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the interest payments due to changes in month libor 
loans and allowances for doubtful accounts customer receivables  primarily consisting of margin loans collateralized by customer owned securities  are charged interest at rates similar to other such loans made throughout the industry 
customer receivables are stated net of allowance for doubtful accounts unsecured or partially secured receivables from customers 
the company also makes loans or pays advances to financial advisors as part of its hiring process 
reserves are established on these receivables if the financial advisor is no longer associated with the company and the receivable has not been promptly repaid or if it is determined that it is probable the amount will not be collected 
legal and regulatory reserves the company records reserves related to legal and regulatory proceedings in accounts payable and other liabilities 
the determination of the amounts of these reserves requires significant judgment on the part of management 
management considers many factors including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  specifically in the case of client litigation  the amount of the loss in the client s account and the possibility of wrongdoing  if any  on the part of an employee of the company  the basis and validity of the claim  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents and case law as well as the timing of the resolution of such matters 
each legal and regulatory proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
any change in the reserve amount i s recorded in the results of that period 
the assumptions of management in determining the estimates of reserves may be incorrect and the actual disposition of a legal or regulatory proceeding could be greater or less than the reserve amount 
intangible assets intangible assets arose upon the acquisition  in january  of the us private client and asset management divisions of cibc world markets inc the oppenheimer divisions and are comprised of customer relationships and trademarks and trade names 
customer relationships are carried at million which is net of accumulated amortization of million and are being amortized on a straight line basis over months commencing in january trademarks and trade names  carried at million  which are not amortized  are subject to at least an annual test for impairment to determine if the fair value is less than their carrying amount 
trademarks and trade names recorded as at december  have been tested for impairment and it has been determined that no impairment has occurred 
goodwill goodwill arose upon the acquisitions of oppenheimer  old michigan corp  josephthal co 
inc  grand charter group incorporated and the oppenheimer divisions 
goodwill is subject to at least an annual test for impairment to determine if the fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
goodwill recorded as at december  has been tested for impairment and it has been determined that no impairment has occurred 
share based compensation plans the company estimates the fair value of share based awards using the black scholes option pricing model and applies to it a forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of share based awards include the expected term and the expected volatility of the company s class a shares over the term of the award  the risk free interest rate over the expected term  and the company s expected annual dividend yield 
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by persons who receive share based awards 
income taxes the company estimates taxes payable and records income tax reserves 
these reserves are based on historic experience and may not reflect the ultimate liability 
the company monitors and adjusts these reserves as necessary 
uncertain tax positions in june  the fasb issued interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin 
this interpretation requires that a tax position be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  based solely on its technical merits  as of the reporting date 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not criterion shall be measured at the largest amount of benefit that is more than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company adopted the provisions of fin on january  which resulted in a cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings in the amount of thousand and a reclassification of deferred tax liabilities in the amount of million to liability for unrecognized tax benefits which was included in accounts payable and other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company s uncertain tax positions primarily consisted of an election made under the internal revenue code of  as amended  to limit current recognition of property that was involuntarily converted to money as a result of monetary damages received 
the company recognizes interest accrued on underpayments of income taxes as interest expense and any related statutory penalties as other expenses in its condensed consolidated statement of income 
during the year ended december   the company recorded approximately thousand in interest related to the involuntary conversion of assets 
in the fourth quarter of  the company effectively settled with the internal revenue service irs related to the involuntary conversion of assets as part of the irs s limited scope examination of the tax period without a material impact to the company s effective income tax rate 
as such  the tax position is no longer uncertain at december  due to its retail branch network  the company is subject to tax examinations in many state and local jurisdictions 
tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction and it is not uncommon to have many examinations open at any given time 
currently  tax examinations are ongoing in new york city  new jersey  florida and michigan 
the company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions resulting from these and subsequent years examinations 
the company has established tax reserves that it believes are sufficient in relation to possible additional assessments 
the company continuously assesses the adequacy of these reserves and believes that the resolution of such matters will not have a material effect on the consolidated balance sheet  although a resolution coul d have a material effect on the company s consolidated statement of income for a particular period and on the company s effective income tax rate for any period in which resolution occurs 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a result of favorable resolutions of tax matters during the period 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows amounts are expressed in thousands of dollars 
balance at january  tax positions taken related to the current year tax positions taken related to prior years settlements with taxing authorities lapse of applicable statute of limitations balance at december  new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  fair value measurements  which provides expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value and does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
in addition  sfas prohibits recognition of block discounts for large holdings of unrestricted financial instruments where quoted prices are readily and regularly available in an active market 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted 
t he company has determined that adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas provides entities with the option to mitigate volatility in reported earnings by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
in addition  sfas allows entities to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates and to report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years with early adoption permitted provided that the entity also elects to apply the provisions of sfas the company has determined that adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
business environment the securities industry is directly affected by general economic and market conditions  including fluctuations in volume and price levels of securities and changes in interest rates  inflation  political events  investor participation levels  legal and regulatory  accounting  tax and compliance requirements and competition  all of which have an impact on commissions  firm trading  fees from accounts under investment management  and investment income as well as on liquidity 
substantial fluctuations can occur in revenues and net income due to these and other factors 
against a background of a deteriorating us dollar  oil prices reaching per barrel  and an unparalleled debt crisis based on record defaults in sub prime mortgages  the us economy and the stock market held up remarkably well during most of the fourth quarter of popular averages reached new all time highs in october and steadily eroded to leave them up modestly for the full year of while u 
s treasuries rallied against an uncertain credit market  most corporate and structured issuer s prices deteriorated significantly as their spreads off of treasuries widened substantially 
volatility increased in the fourth quarter of but volumes remained high and certain sectors such as technology  oil and gas and consumer durables remained at their highest levels of the year 
the impact of defaults and foreclosures in the sub prime mortgage market and the inability of the credit markets to asses s the creditworthiness of various issuers of commercial paper and asset backed securities are likely to lead to continued turmoil in capital markets and with home prices declining amid rising unemployment  the probabilities of a recession have dramatically increased 
oppenheimer s business continued to thrive despite this economic backdrop with increases in commissions  fee based revenues  income derived from investment activity and a record level of incentive fees from general partner participations in alternative investments owned by clients 
at december   shareholders equity was approximately million and book value per share was compared to shareholders equity of approximately million and book value per share of at december   an increase of 
assets under fee based management increased by to billion at december  compared to billion at december   reflecting organic growth and increased market value 
the company is not involved in the sub prime mortgage business  and does not have any exposure to that business as a result of its acquisition of the new capital markets business or by virtue of the mortgage brokerage and servicing business of evanston 
interest rate changes impact the company s costs associated with carrying proprietary fixed income and equity inventories as well as its cost of borrowed funds 
interest rates were lower in the year ended december  compared to investor interest in fixed income securities is driven by attractiveness of published rates  the direction of rates and economic expectations 
volatility in bond prices also impacts opportunities for profits in fixed income proprietary trading 
management monitors its exposure to interest rate fluctuations to mitigate risk of loss in volatile environments 
the company s focus continues to be the expansion and building of its business  through the attraction of new clients  investment in experienced professionals throughout the company and continued improvement in its technology platform 
regulatory environment the brokerage business is subject to regulation by the sec  finra formerly the nyse and nasd and various state securities regulators 
events in recent years surrounding corporate accounting and other activities leading to investor losses resulted in the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act and have caused increased regulation of public companies 
new regulations and new interpretations and enforcement of existing regulations are creating increased costs of compliance and increased investment in systems and procedures to comply with these more complex and onerous requirements 
increasingly  the various states are imposing their own regulations that make the uniformity of regulation a thing of the past  and make compliance more difficult and more expensive to monitor 
this regulatory environment has resulted in increased costs of compliance with rules and regulations  in particular  the impact of the rules and requirements that were created by the passage of the patriot act  and the anti money laundering regulations aml that are related thereto 
the expectation is that the increased costs of compliance in today s regulatory environment are not temporary 
new rules relating to supervisory control processes nasd rule and nyse rule became effective during on march   the chief executive officers ceos of regulated broker dealers including the ceo of oppenheimer were required to certify that their companies have processes to establish and test policies and procedures reasonably designed to achieve compliance with federal securities laws and regulations  including applicable regulations of self regulatory organizations 
the ceo of the company is required to make such a certification on an annual basis 
mutual fund inquiry on december   the company reported that the company s main operating subsidiary  oppenheimer  submitted an acceptance  waiver consent awc to finra to settle any charges that may have been brought by finra in connection with the previously reported investigation into certain market timing activities conducted by several former oppenheimer employees working out of a single branch office 
on december   the awc was accepted by finra 
pursuant to the awc  oppenheimer agreed to accept a censure  to pay a fine of  and to make a compensatory payment in an aggregate amount of  to certain mutual funds identified and set forth in a schedule to the awc within thirty days 
as previously reported  the company had set aside sufficient amounts to fully reserve for this matter 
other regulatory matters on october   finra issued an order the settlement order accepting a settlement of the previously reported disciplinary proceeding brought against oppenheimer and oppenheimer s chairman and ceo albert g 
lowenthal 
the disciplinary proceeding related to issues associated with oppenheimer s response to an industry wide mutual fund breakpoint survey 
pursuant to the settlement order  all charges brought against mr 
lowenthal were dismissed in their entirety 
in addition  pursuant to the settlement order  oppenheimer  without admitting or denying the allegations of the complaint  agreed to a censure  the payment of a fine in the amount of million and agreed to undertake i to engage an independent consultant to evaluate its policies  systems and procedures for responding to information requests from regulators and ii to conduct and report the results of internal audits of its processes for intake  assignment and responses to regulatory inquiries to finra quarterly for the next six quarters 
as previously reported  the company had set aside sufficient amounts to fully reserve for this matter and further  the company has returned to customers approximately  in breakpoint credits and revised and enhanced procedures for determining applicable breakpoints 
all amounts due to customers have been refunded 
on april   oppenheimer received an invitation from the nyse to make a wells submission with respect to its activities as a broker dealer and as a clearing firm in connection with oppenheimer s supervision of its securities lending activities including  but not limited to  failing to detect and prevent stock loan personnel from engaging in business dealings with finders in violation of oppenheimer policy 
the company believes that this matter has no effect on any client of oppenheimer and that at all times oppenheimer s supervision of its securities lending activities was reasonable and in accordance with industry standards 
any disciplinary proceedings brought against oppenheimer in relation to the foregoing could result in  among other things  a censure  a fine and or the imposition of an undertaking against oppenheimer 
other matters a subsidiary of the company was the administrative agent for two closed end funds until december  the company has been advised by the current administrative agent for these two funds that the internal revenue service may file a claim for interest and penalties for one of these funds with respect to the tax year as a result of an alleged failure of such subsidiary to take certain actions 
the company will continue to monitor developments on this matter 
as part of its ongoing business  the company records reserves for legal expenses  judgments  fines and or awards attributable to litigation and regulatory matters 
in connection therewith  the company has maintained its legal reserves at levels it believes will resolve outstanding matters  but may increase or decrease such reserves as matters warrant 
business continuity the company is committed to an on going investment in its technology and communications infrastructure including extensive business continuity planning and investment 
these costs are on going and the company believes that current and future costs will exceed historic levels due to business and regulatory requirements 
the company believes that internally generated funds from operations are sufficient to finance its expenditure program 
outlook the company s long term plan is to continue to expand existing offices by hiring experienced professionals as well as through the purchase of operating branch offices from other broker dealers  thus maximizing the potential of each office and the development of existing trading  investment banking  investment advisory and other activities 
equally important is the search for viable acquisition candidates 
as opportunities are presented  it is the long term intention of the company to pursue growth by acquisition where a comfortable match can be found in terms of corporate goals and personnel and at a price that would provide the company s shareholders with incremental value 
to point  the company has acquired on january   the new capital markets business described under item  business 
the company may review additional acquisitions  and will continue to focus its attention on the management of its existing busi ness 
in addition  the company is committed to improving its technology capabilities to support client service and the expansion of its capital markets capabilities 
results of operations the year ended december  was the most successful year in the company s history measured by revenue  net profit  earnings per share and book value 
markets were strong throughout the year  producing record revenues from transactional business from both private client and capital markets and increased fees from fee based programs 
interest income for was impacted by lower rates on customer debit balances and increased activity in the securities lending business 
in addition  the company s performance was positively impacted by its participation as general partner in various alternative investments that had significantly better performance in compared to the following table sets forth the amount and percentage of the company s revenue from each principal source for each of the following years ended december amounts are expressed in thousands of dollars 
commissions principal transactions  net interest investment banking advisory fees other total revenue the company derives most of its revenue from the operations of its principal subsidiaries  oppenheimer and oam 
although maintained as separate entities  the operations of the company s brokerage subsidiaries are closely related because oppenheimer acts as clearing broker and omnibus clearing agent in transactions initiated by freedom 
except as expressly otherwise stated  the discussion below pertains to the operations of oppenheimer 
the following table and discussion summarizes the changes in the major revenue and expense categories for the past two years 
amounts are expressed in thousands of dollars 
period to period change increase decrease versus versus amount percentage amount percentage revenue commissions principal transactions  net interest investment banking advisory fees other total revenue period to period change increase decrease versus versus amount percentage amount percentage expenses compensation and related expenses clearing and exchange fees communications and technology occupancy and equipment costs interest other total expenses profit before taxes income taxes net profit fiscal compared to fiscal revenue  other than interest commission income and  to a large extent  income from principal transactions depend on investor participation in the markets 
in the year ended december   commission revenue increased by compared to fiscal derived primarily from stronger investor interest in the otc markets in compared to commission revenue has been impacted by a general compression in rates charged to clients for transactions as well as clients changing their accounts to fee based arrangements 
net revenue from principal transactions decreased by in the year ended december  compared to fiscal with increased market volatility in  the company has scaled back its exposure to proprietary trading activities 
investment banking revenues increased in the year ended december  compared with fiscal approximately of this increase was generated by new issue and secondary issuance and of this increase was generated by corporate finance advisory and placement fees 
advisory fees increased by for the year ended december  compared to fiscal assets under management by the asset management groups were billion at december   compared to billion at december  performance fees earned by oam and oppenheimer as a result of participation as general partner in various alternative investments produced revenue of million in compared to million in  representing of the increase in compared to other revenue decreased by in the year ended december  compared to fiscal fiscal included million relating to the nyse group transactions and million relating to the gain on extinguishment of the debentures  while fiscal included a million gain from the extinguishment of the zero coupon notes 
these transactions are described in notes and  respectively  to the company  s consolidated financial statements  included in item interest net interest revenue interest revenue less interest expense increased in the year ended december  compared to fiscal interest revenue which primarily relates to revenue from customer margin balances and securities lending activities increased in fiscal compared to fiscal average stock borrow balances increased by approximately  offset by lower average customer debit balances and lower interest rates 
interest expense in fiscal decreased by compared to fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower interest expense related to the company s debentures repaid in full on october  and senior secured credit note originally issued on july  in the amount of million and with an outstanding balance of million at december  
see the discussion under business other requirements and note to the company s consolidated financi al statements  included in item the other significant reason for the decrease in interest expense arose because of lower average bank call loan balances in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of stronger business and cash flows in fiscal compared to fiscal expenses  other than interest compensation and related expense increased by in the year ended december  compared to fiscal compensation expense  including the company s accrual for year end bonuses  has volume related components and  therefore  will increase with the increased level of underlying business conducted in the year ended december   compared to fiscal the amortization of forgivable loans to financial advisors is included in compensation expense 
this expense is relatively fixed and is not influenced by increases or decreases in revenue levels  but rather by the net number of financial advisors hired in one period compared to another 
note amortization expense in fiscal was approximately million compared to approximately million in fiscal as of january   the company adopted sfas r  resulting in approximately million of compensation expense in fiscal compared to approximately million in fiscal relating to the expensing of share based awards 
the company s stock appreciation rights which  under accounting guidelines  are re measured at fair value at each period end based on the closing price of the company s class a shares are the largest component of share based compensation expense 
the cost of clearing and exchange fees increased by in the year ended december  compared to fiscal due to higher transactional volume in the cost of communications and technology increased in the year ended december  compared to fiscal the increase is driven largely by the increased costs of external data services employed to support the increased requirements of the business in compared to occupancy and equipment costs decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to reduced equipment costs 
other expenses decreased by for the year ended december  compared to fiscal in fiscal increased third party finders fees were offset by decreased costs for legal and regulatory settlement costs 
the cost of professional fees decreased by and represented of the decrease in other expenses in fiscal compared to as the company resolved matters previously reserved 
other expenses will continue to be impacted by litigation and regulatory settlement costs

see item a risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management the company s principal business activities by their nature involve significant market  credit and other risks 
the company s effectiveness in managing these risks is critical to its success and stability 
as part of its normal business operations  the company engages in the trading of both fixed income and equity securities in both a proprietary and market making capacity 
the company makes markets in over the counter equities in order to facilitate order flow and accommodate its institutional and retail customers 
the company also makes markets in municipal bonds  mortgage backed securities  government bonds and high yield bonds and short term fixed income securities and loans issued by various corporations 
market risk 
market risk generally means the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodity prices 
market risk is inherent in all types of financial instruments  including both derivatives and non derivatives 
the company s exposure to market risk arises from its role as a financial intermediary for its customers transactions and from its proprietary trading and arbitrage activities 
oppenheimer monitors market risks through daily profit and loss statements and position reports 
each trading department adheres to internal position limits determined by senior management and regularly reviews the age and composition of its proprietary accounts 
positions and profits and losses for each trading department are reported to senior management on a daily basis 
in its market making activities  oppenheimer must provide liquidity in the equities for which it makes markets 
as a result of this  oppenheimer has risk containment policies in place  which limit position size and monitor transactions on a minute to minute basis 
credit risk 
credit risk represents the loss that the company would incur if a client  counterparty or issuer of securities or other instruments held by the company fails to perform its contractual obligations 
the company follows industry practice to reduce credit risk related to various investing and financing activities by obtaining and maintaining collateral 
the company adjusts margin requirements if it believes the risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
when oppenheimer advances funds or securities to a counterparty in a principal transaction or to a customer in a brokered transaction  it is subject to the risk that the counterparty or customer will not repay such advances 
if the market price of the securities purchased or loaned has declined or increased  respectively  oppenheimer may be unable to recover some or all of the value of the amount advanced 
a similar risk is also present where a customer is unable to respond to a margin call and the market price of the collateral has dropped 
in addition  oppenheimer s securities positions are subject to fluctuations in market value and liquidity 
in addition to monitoring the credit worthiness of its customers  oppenheimer imposes more conservative margin requirements than those of the nyse 
generally  oppenheimer limits customer loans to an amount not greater than of the value of the securities or if the securities in the account are concentrated in a limited number of issues 
particular attention and more restrictive requirements are placed on more highly volatile securities traded in the nasdaq market 
in comparison  the nyse permits loans of up to of the value of the equity securities in a customer s account 
further discussion of credit risk appears in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  included in item operational risk 
operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in its operating systems  business disruptions and inadequacies or breaches in its internal control processes 
the company operates in diverse markets and it is reliant on the ability of its employees and systems to process high numbers of transactions often within short time frames 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems  human error or improper action by employees  the company could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions or damage to its reputation 
in order to mitigate and control operational risk  the company has developed and continues to enhance policies and procedures including the maintenance of disaster recovery facilities and procedures related thereto that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels 
with respect to its trading activities  the company has procedures designed to ensure that all transactions are accurately recorded and properly reflected on the company s books on a timely basis 
with respect to client activities  the company operates a system of internal controls designed to ensure that transactions and other account activity new account solicitation  transaction authorization  transaction processing  billing and collection are properly approved  processed  recorded and reconciled

for details of funding risk  see item  under the caption liquidity and capital resources 
legal and regulatory risk 
legal and regulatory risk includes the risk of non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements  client claims and the possibility of sizeable adverse legal judgments 
the company is subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts its activities 
regulatory oversight of the securities industry has become increasingly intense over the past few years and the company  as well as others in the industry  has been directly affected by this increased regulatory scrutiny 
timely and accurate compliance with regulatory requests has become increasingly problematic  and regulators have tended to bring enforcement proceedings in relation to such matters 
see further discussion in item  under the caption regulatory environment 
the company has comprehensive procedures for addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds and securities  granting of credit  collection activities  money laundering  and record keeping 
the company has designated anti money laundering compliance officers who monitor compliance with regulations under the us patriot act 
see further discussion on the company s reserve policy in item  under the caption critical accounting estimates  item  legal proceedings and item  regulation 
off balance sheet arrangements 
the company does not rely on off balance sheet arrangements or transactions with unconsolidated  special purpose or limited purpose entities to manage risk 
value at risk value at risk is a statistical measure of the potential loss in the fair value of a portfolio due to adverse movements in underlying risk factors 
in response to the sec s market risk disclosure requirements  the company has performed a value at risk analysis of its trading of financial instruments and derivatives 
the value at risk calculation uses standard statistical techniques to measure the potential loss in fair value based upon a one day holding period and a confidence level 
the calculation is based upon a variance covariance methodology  which assumes a normal distribution of changes in portfolio value 
the forecasts of variances and co variances used to construct the model  for the market factors relevant to the portfolio  were generated from historical data 
although value at risk models are sophisticated tools  their use can be limited as historical data is not always an accurate predictor of future conditions 
the company attempts to manage its market exposure using other methods  including trading authorization limits and concentration limits 
at december  and  the company s value at risk for each component of market risk was as follows in thousands of dollars fiscal as at december  high low average equity price risk interest rate risk commodity price risk diversification benefit total the potential future loss presented by the total value at risk generally falls within predetermined levels of loss that should not be material to the company s results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the changes in the value at risk amounts reported in from those reported in reflect changes in the size and composition of the company s trading portfolio at december  compared to december  the company s portfolio as at december  includes approximately million million in in corporate equities  which are related to deferred compensation liabilities and which do not bear any value at risk to the company 
the company used derivative financial instruments to hedge market risk in fiscal and  including in connection with the senior secured credit note  which is described in note of the notes to the consoli dated financial statements  appearing in item such information is hereby incorporated by reference 
further discussion of risk management appears in item  management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations and item a  risk factors 
the value at risk estimate has limitations that should be considered in evaluating the company s potential future losses based on the year end portfolio positions 
recent market conditions including increased volatility  may result in statistical relationships that result in higher value at risk than would be estimated from the same portfolio under different market conditions 
likewise  the converse may be true 
critical risk management strategy involves the active management of portfolio levels to reduce market risk 
the company s market risk exposure is continuously monitored as the portfolio risks and market conditions change
