item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended december   which appear in item of part ii of this annual report 
overview the corporation is a financial holding company which  through the bank and its non bank subsidiaries  provides an array of financial products and services primarily to customers in four western maryland counties and four northeastern west virginia counties 
its principal operating subsidiary is the bank  which consists of a community banking network of branch offices located throughout its market areas 
our primary sources of revenue are interest income earned from our loan and investment securities portfolios and fees earned from financial services provided to customers 
consolidated net income for totaled million or per share  compared to million or per share for the increase in net income resulted primarily from increases in other operating income  particularly  trust department income  insurance commissions  secondary market fees  and debit card income offset by a non recurring pre tax charge of approximately million million or 
per share  net of tax associated with the transfer of certain investment securities from the available for sale category to the trading category during the first quarter of and the subsequent sale of those securities during the second quarter 
during  earnings on interest earning assets increased due to the increases in the general level of interest rates that occurred during the latter part of and during the first nine months of  a restructuring of the investment portfolio and increased average balances of our interest earning assets 
however  this increase in interest income was substantially offset by increased interest expense paid on our interest bearing liabilities due to rising interest rates and an increase in the related average balances 
as a result of the factors impacting interest income and expense  our net interest income in increased million when compared to our net interest margin remained stable throughout despite the rising interest rate environment 
the net interest margin fell slightly to in from in the provision for loan losses was million in  compared to million for the increase in the provision in was due to increased net charge offs  an increase in non accrual loans  loan growth and changes in economic conditions during our performance ratios declined during in comparison to due to the recognition of a million pre tax loss on the sale of investment securities in conjunction with a restructuring of our investment portfolio 
the proceeds from the sale were reinvested in securities with a higher yield that should generate an additional 
million of interest income annually 
our year to date actual performance results compared to performance results  exclusive of the impact of the non recurring securities losses and the associated increase in interest income and taxes  are presented in the following table for the years ended december  december  actual performance excluding securities loss associated income and taxes actual net income earnings per share return on average equity return on average assets operations in were impacted by the following factors and strategic initiatives increased loan and deposit growth impact on net interest margin we experienced a significant increase of million in loans in when compared to growth in the residential mortgage portfolio of million was attributable to a million mortgage loan purchase that was consummated at the end of april this purchase was offset by a slight decline in the in house portfolio  which resulted from a flat interest rate yield curve and a shift to secondary market loans due to a consumer preference for fixed rate mortgage loans 
the bank primarily originates fixed rate loans for the secondary mortgage market 
the commercial portfolio increased million as a result of in house production and commercial participations with other financial institutions 
these increases were offset by a decline of million in the installment loan portfolio 
interest income in exceeded the amount generated in prior years by million on a fully taxable equivalent basis due to the increase in the loan portfolio 
interest income on investment securities increased by million on a fully taxable equivalent basis due to a million leverage strategy and the restructuring during the second quarter into higher yielding investments 
additional information on the composition of interest income is available in table that appears on page 
funding costs in increased as a result of the rising interest rate environment during the latter half of and the intense retail deposit competition in our market areas 
deposits at december  increased million when compared to deposits at december  interest bearing demand deposits increased million due to successful retail growth in money market products and an increase of million in brokered money market funds 
this increase was offset by a decline in time deposits of  or more and declines in non interest bearing demand deposits 
the increases in the higher rate money market accounts throughout increased deposit interest expense by approximately million when compared to although net borrowings increased by million in when compared to  we realized a minimal increase in interest expense on these borrowings 
the combination of increased loan and deposit growth  rising interest rates on our assets and liabilities  and the increased level of debt resulted in an increase in net interest income on a tax equivalent basis of million in when compared to the overall net interest margin declined slightly during to from in on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
other operating income other operating expense other operating income increased million in when compared to our continued emphasis on generating fee based income resulted in increases in service charge income  trust department income  and insurance commission income 
these increases were offset by the recognition of a one time loss of million associated with the transfer of investment securities from the available for sale category to the trading category in the first quarter of and the subsequent sale of these securities in the second quarter of excluding this non recurring charge  other operating income increased million for when compared to other operating expenses increased in when compared to the increase is attributable to increases in personnel expenses due to the hiring of several regional market presidents to strengthen our presence in key market areas  expansion of our branch network and normal merit increases 
occupancy and equipment expenses increased due to the opening of three new branch offices and our new operations center 
in addition  we experienced increases in other expenses such as marketing  consulting and other miscellaneous expenses 
dividends the corporation continued its tradition of paying dividends to shareholders during  increasing them to per share  a increase from per share in the corporation has paid quarterly cash dividends consistently since  the year in which it was formed 
looking forward we will continue to face risks and challenges in the future  including changes in local economic conditions in our core geographic markets  potential yield compression on loan and deposit products from existing competitors and potential new entrants in our markets  fluctuations in interest rates and changes to existing federal and state legislation and regulations over banks and financial holding companies 
for a more complete discussion of these risk factors  see item a of part i of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report 
on an on going basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to loan losses and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses one of our most important accounting policies is that related to the monitoring of the loan portfolio 
a variety of estimates impact the carrying value of the loan portfolio  including the calculation of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of underlying collateral  the timing of loan charge offs and the placement of loans on non accrual status 
the allowance is established and maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payment on loans 
estimates for loan losses are arrived at by analyzing risks associated with the specific loans and the loan portfolio  current and historical trends in delinquencies and charge offs  and changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio 
the analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction  changes in lending rates  political conditions  legislation impacting the banking industry and economic conditions specific to western maryland and northeastern west virginia 
because the calculation of the allowance for loan losses relies on management s estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  actual results may differ from management s estimates 
the allowance for loan losses is also discussed below in this item under the caption allowance and provision for loan losses and in note to consolidated financial statements contained in item of part ii of this annual report 
goodwill and other intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and the non amortization and impairment assessment of goodwill 
we have million of core deposit intangible assets and million related to acquisitions of insurance books of business which are subject to amortization 
the million in recorded goodwill is primarily related to the acquisition of huntington national bank branches that occurred in  which is not subject to periodic amortization 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
our goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking business and the value is dependent upon our ability to provide quality  cost effective services in a highly competitive local market 
this ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems  the development of value added service features and the ease of use of our services 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill  which could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
sfas no 
requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
the determination of whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
management has completed its annual evaluation for impairment and concluded that the recorded value of goodwill was not impaired 
however  future changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities securities available for sale securities available for sale are stated at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
the amortized cost of debt securities classified as available for sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums to the first call date  if applicable  or to maturity  and for accretion of discounts to maturity  or in the case of mortgage backed securities  over the estimated life of the security 
such amortization and accretion  plus interest and dividends  are included in interest income from investments 
management systematically evaluates investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis 
declines in the fair value of available for sale securities below their cost that are considered other than temporary declines are recognized in earnings as realized losses in the period in which the impairment determination is made 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the corporation to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded using the specific identification method 
pension plan assumptions our pension plan costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  as discussed within the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
r and as amended by sfas no 
 employers accounting for deferred benefit pension and other post retirement plans 
pension expense and the determination of our projected pension liability are based upon two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
we evaluate each of these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions impact the determination of pension expense and the projected liability including the primary employee demographics  such as retirement patterns  employee turnover  mortality rates  and estimated employer compensation increases 
these factors  along with the critical assumptions  are carefully reviewed by management each year in consultation with our pension plan consultants and actuaries 
further information about our pension plan assumptions  the plan s funded status  and other plan information is included in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of part ii of this annual report 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  part ii of this annual report discusses new accounting pronouncements that when adopted  may have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
consolidated statement of income review net interest income net interest income is the largest source of operating revenue 
net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
for analytical and discussion purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate performance comparisons between taxable and tax exempt assets by increasing tax exempt income by an amount equal to the federal income taxes that would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutorily applicable rate 
the table below summarizes net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for the years dollars in thousands 
interest income interest expense net interest income net interest margin net interest income increased million in over the same period in  due to a million increase in interest income offset by a million increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income resulted from an increase in average interest earning assets of million during when compared to the increased level of interest earning assets is attributable to the growth that we experienced in our loan and investment portfolios during emphasis on adjustable rate loan products and the investment portfolio restructuring contributed to the increase in the average yield on our average earning assets of basis points  from in to in on a fully tax equivalent basis 
the average yield on loans increased by basis points and the yield on investment securities as a percentage of interest earning assets increased basis points from to interest expense increased during when compared to due to the higher interest rate environment  and an overall increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million 
deposits increased in by approximately million due to successful retail growth in money market products and the purchase of million in brokered money market funds 
the combined effect of the competitive retail rate environment and the volume increases in our average interest bearing liabilities resulted in a basis point increase in the average rate paid on our average interest bearing liabilities from for to for the net result of the aforementioned factors was a basis point decline in the net interest margin at december  to from at december  comparing to  net interest income increased million due to an increase in interest income of million  offset by an increase in interest expense of million 
the increase in interest income resulted from an increase in average interest earning assets of million during when compared to this increase was attributable to the growth that we experienced in our investment portfolio late in and throughout emphasis on adjustable rate loan products and the rising interest rate environment contributed to the increase in the average rate on our average earning assets of basis points  from in to in on a fully tax equivalent basis 
interest expense increased during when compared to due to the higher interest rate environment  and an overall increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million 
deposits increased in by million due to an increase in brokered certificates of deposit and a successful retail promotion of a nine month certificate of deposit 
the combined effect of the increasing rate environment and the volume increases in our average interest bearing liabilities resulted in an basis point increase in the average rate paid on our average interest bearing liabilities from in to in the net result was a basis point increase in net interest margin from at the end of to at the end of as shown below  the composition of total interest income over the three year period from to shows a gradual increase in interest on investments and a corresponding decline in interest and fees on loans 
this shift is attributable to the leverage strategies implemented in the last six months of and throughout leverage strategies are the purchase of investment securities funded by borrowings of matched terms and durations

we have policies and procedures designed to mitigate credit risk and to maintain the quality of our loan portfolio 
these policies include underwriting standards for new credits as well as continuous monitoring and reporting policies for asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
these policies  coupled with ongoing training efforts  have provided effective checks and balances for the risk associated with the lending process 
lending authority is based on the type of the loan  and the experience of the lending officer 
commercial loans are collateralized primarily by real estate  and to a lesser extent  by equipment and vehicles 
unsecured commercial loans represent an insignificant portion of total commercial loans 
residential mortgage loans are collateralized by the related property 
any residential mortgage loan exceeding a specified internal loan to value ratio requires private mortgage insurance 
installment loans are typically collateralized  with loan to value ratios which are established based on the financial condition of the borrower 
we will also make unsecured consumer loans to qualified borrowers meeting our underwriting standards 
additional information about our loans and underwriting policies can be found in item of part i of this annual report under the caption banking products and services 
table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio 
historically  our policy has been to make the majority of our loan commitments in our market areas 
we had no foreign loans in our portfolio as of december for all of the periods presented 
summary of loan portfolio dollars in thousands table loans outstanding as of december commercial real estate mortgage consumer installment real estate construction lease financing total loans during  gross loans increased by million  or  over this growth was focused in our commercial million and residential mortgage million loan portfolios  offset by a decline in installment million and residential construction million  and remains consistent with management s objectives over the past several years 
continued efforts were made to increase the percentage of loans in the portfolio with adjustable interest rates 
at december   adjustable interest rate loans maturing within one to five years were of total loans  compared to at december  commercial loans increased in  following a increase in origination of new commercial loans remained high in  similar to  as our lenders continued to identify new customer opportunities  expand existing customer relationships in all of our market areas  while maintaining existing standards of credit worthiness 
during  we expanded our commercial loan participations with other financial institutions and experienced a slow down in loan payback 
most new commercial loans were priced on a variable rate basis  resetting monthly  which proved to be very popular with business borrowers 
commercial loans secured by real estate were of total commercial loans at the end of  compared to at the end of and at the end of residential mortgage loans increased by million  or  in when compared to this follows a increase in over this growth in the residential mortgage portfolio in is attributable to a million mortgage loan purchase that was consummated at the end of april this purchase was offset by a slight decline in the in house portfolio  which resulted from a flat interest rate yield curve and a consumer preference for locking in fixed rate mortgage loans 
the bank primarily originates fixed rate loans for the secondary mortgage market 
fixed interest rate loans made up of the total loan portfolio at the end of  compared to of total loans at the end of and at the end of consumer installment loans in decreased by million  or  when compared to this decrease reflects management s continued shift toward more commercial loans with less emphasis on the highly competitive consumer loan market and indirect car dealer loans 
specifically  less focus was placed on generating new indirect auto loans during and indirect auto loans comprise the largest percentage of installment loans  at the end of  and and at the end of and  respectively 
the remaining lease financing portfolio was repaid in and we discontinued this line of business

management considers such factors as payment history  the nature of the collateral securing the loan  and the overall economic situation of the borrower when making a non accrual decision 
management closely monitors the status of all non accrual loans 
a non accruing loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments have been brought current  it becomes well secured  or is in the process of collection and the prospects of future contractual payments are no longer in doubt 
generally  consumer installment loans are not placed on non accrual status  but are charged off after they are days contractually past due

million during and and 
million in allowance for loan losses an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses from the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s continuing evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio  assessment of current economic conditions  diversification and size of the portfolio  adequacy of collateral  past and anticipated loss experience  and the amount of non performing loans 
we use the methodology outlined in fdic statement of policy on allowance for loan losses 
the starting point for this methodology is to segregate the loan portfolio into two pools  non homogeneous ie  commercial and homogeneous ie  consumer and residential mortgage loans 
each loan pool is analyzed with general allowances and specific allocations being made as appropriate 
for general allowances  the previous eight quarters of loss activity are used in the estimation of losses in the current portfolio 
these historical loss amounts are modified by the following qualitative factors levels of and trends in delinquency rates and non accrual loans  trends in volumes and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policies  experience  ability  and depth of management  national and local economic trends and conditions  and concentrations of credit in the determination of the general allowance 
the qualitative factors are updated each quarter by information obtained from internal  regulatory  and governmental sources 
specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses are made for those loans on the watchlist in which the collateral value is less than the outstanding loan balance with the allocation being the dollar difference between the two 
the watchlist represents loans  identified and closely monitored by management  which possess certain qualities or characteristics that may lead to collection and loss issues 
allocations are not made for loans that are cash secured  for the small business administration and farm service agency guaranteed portion of loans  or for loans that are sufficiently collateralized 
the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and actual losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed quarterly  and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  a corresponding increase or decrease is made in the allowance for loan losses 
the methodology used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is consistent with prior years 
an estimate for probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments  such as letters of credit and binding but unfunded loan commitments is also prepared 
this estimate is computed in a manner similar to the methodology described above  adjusted for the probability of actually funding the commitment 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased to million at december   from million at december  several factors contributed to the 
million increase in the balance of the allowance in  including a increase in the balance of non accrual loans from million in to million in  changes to the qualitative factors which are reviewed quarterly  an increase in impaired loans from 
million in to million in  and an increase in the percentage of net charge offs to average outstanding loans from 
in to 
in non accrual loans and impaired loans consist primarily of real estate acquisition and development loans that have experienced a slowdown in the level of sales activity during the current year 
all of these types of credit facilities were thoroughly reviewed by management during the fourth quarter of as to the adequacy of the collateral  the valuation of collateral  and other credit quality attributes 
collateral valuations were also subject to a sensitivity and shock analysis in order to identify loans that may not have sufficient collateral in the event of a significant decline in the market value of the collateral 
as a result of this extensive review  some specific allocations of the allowance were made to several a d loans 
at december   the balance of the allowance was equal to 
of total loans  which was five times the amount of net charge offs for the year 
performing loans considered potential problem loans  as defined and identified by management  amounted to million at december  loans are identified as potential problem loans when management has concerns regarding the borrowers ability to comply with the loan repayment terms  and when the loan is classified as substandard and is one or two payments past due 
management believes that most of these loans have sufficient collateral and do not present a significant risk of loss 
during there was significant coverage in the media regarding the topic of sub prime loans and the resulting increase in loan delinquencies and foreclosures 
a sub prime loan is defined generally as loan to a borrower with a weak credit record or a reduced repayment capacity 
these borrowers typically pose a higher risk of default and foreclosure 
we generally do not make sub prime loans 
if credit is extended to a sub prime borrower  the decision to lend is based on the presence of facts and circumstances that management believes mitigate the risks inherent in this type of loan 
as of december   management believes that our exposure to sub prime loans is very minimal 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased to million at december   from million at december  several factors contributed to the 
million increase in the balance of the allowance in  including a increase in the balance of non accrual loans from million in to million in  changes to the qualitative factors which are reviewed quarterly  a decrease in impaired loans from 
million in to 
million in  and a decrease in the percentage of net charge offs to average outstanding loans from 
in to 
in  due to a decline in the amount of commercial and installment loan charge offs during at december   the balance of the allowance was equal to 
of total loans  which was six times the amount of net charge offs for the year 
as a result of management s evaluation of the loan portfolio using the factors and methodology described above  management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate as of december  table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses by major loan category for the past five years

accordingly  the entire allowance is considered available to absorb losses in any category

the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities sfas no 
and statement of financial accounting standards no 
fair value measurement sfas no 
 and presented financial information related to an associated restructuring of our investment portfolio 
the decision to early adopt fair value accounting was based on what we believed to be an appropriate interpretation of sfas no 
at that time after consulting with our independent registered public accounting firm 
the decision to early adopt was also influenced by our decision to substantially change the economic position of our investment portfolio by shifting the anticipated cash flow of the investment portfolio from maturing securities  amortizing securities and securities subject to call from the short term period of nine months to three years into the intermediate term of three to eight years 
after that press release was issued  informal guidance emerged that created uncertainty as to the proper interpretation and implementation of these accounting standards  which caused us to re evaluate our initial intent to early adopt them 
as a result of our re evaluation  and after considering the totality of the circumstances at that time  we decided to rescind our initial early adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
we nevertheless believe that our investment portfolio restructuring will provide long term benefits to shareholders 
the restructuring referred to above enabled us to improve our investment portfolio by replacing certain securities with securities having a longer duration 
this was accomplished in the first quarter of through the transfer of available for sale securities with a carrying value of million at the beginning of the quarter to trading securities with the anticipation of selling the securities and replacing them with higher yielding investments 
we determined that the securities earmarked for sale would  if retained  have subjected our earnings to higher volatility in a declining interest rate environment 
as a result of transferring these securities to the trading category and our decision to rescind sfas no 
and sfas no 
 we recognized a pre tax loss of approximately million in earnings for the first quarter of on april   we sold million of the securities held in trading at march  recognizing an additional loss of 
million 
as anticipated  these losses have been partially offset by the increase in investment income that we have recognized from the restructuring 
the securities sold had an average book yield of 
the proceeds from the sale of these securities were reinvested in securities having an average book yield of approximately 
the securities purchased included government agency bonds with a longer duration than those sold as well as tax free municipal bonds 
the longer duration bonds were purchased at a discount and better position the corporation in a declining interest rate environment by protecting against premium and reinvestment risk 
the municipal bonds assist in lowering our effective tax rate 
during the past few years  we have undertaken several strategies to reduce the risk of future investment cash flow being reinvested in a lower interest rate environment 
the restructuring of our investment portfolio enabled us to rebalance the portfolio and restructure the maturity schedule of the portfolio to mitigate the effects of premium and call risk and to manage our future interest rate risk and effective tax yield 
we expect the restructuring to result in an on going stream of higher interest income for shareholders and to have a positive impact on our net interest margin 
our entire security portfolio is categorized as available for sale 
investment securities classified as available for sale are held for an indefinite period of time and may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions or for liquidity purposes as part of our overall asset liability management strategy 
available for sale securities are reported at market value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income included in shareholders equity  net of applicable income taxes 
we do not currently purchase securities with the intent to resell and  therefore  do not own any securities classified as trading securities

the following sets forth the composition of our securities portfolio by major category as of the indicated dates in thousands december fair value as of total as of total as of total securities available for sale us government and agencies mortgage backed securities obligation of states and political subdivisions corporate and other debt other securities total total investment securities increased million in when compared to the year end balance 
the increase in our investment portfolio since year end is primarily due to the purchase of million in corporate bonds during the first quarter of as part of a leverage strategy originally implemented during the fourth quarter of and the purchase of additional securities in september mortgage backed securities increased by million and tax exempt municipal bonds increased by million while us government agencies decreased million 
total investment securities increased million in when compared to the year end balance in this increase is attributable to an investment leverage strategy utilized during the bank purchased million of investment grade corporate bonds with a quarterly adjustable rate and funded this purchase with three month brokered certificates of deposit 
us government agencies decreased million and tax exempt municipal bonds increased by million while mortgage backed securities declined by million due to maturities and repayments 
at december   the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized loss of million  which represents the difference between fair value and amortized cost 
the comparable amount at december  was a net unrealized loss of million 
the fair values of securities available for sale will generally decrease whenever interest rates increase  and the fair values will typically increase in a declining rate environment 
securities available for sale are reviewed for possible other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis 
during this review  management considers the severity and duration of the unrealized losses as well as its intent and ability to hold the securities until recovery  taking into account balance sheet management strategies and its market view and outlook 
management also assesses the nature of the unrealized losses taking into consideration factors such as changes in the general level of interest rates  creditworthiness of the issuer or any credit enhancement providers  and the quality of the underlying collateral 
management also reviewed mortgage backed securities with unrealized losses for other than temporary impairment 
all the issuers of the mortgage backed securities in our portfolio are of investment grade quality 
additional analysis was performed on the investment portfolio during the fourth quarter of due to recent economic weaknesses  particularly in the financial sector 
management does not believe that an unrealized loss on any individual security as of december  represents an other than temporary impairment 
we have both the intent and ability to hold the securities available for sale presented in the preceding table for the period of time necessary to recover their amortized cost or until maturity 
during  there was significant media attention regarding sub prime mortgage investments 
sub prime mortgages with similar characteristics can be packaged together and sold as investments 
we believe that we do not have significant exposure to these types of securities 
we manage our investment portfolios utilizing policies which seek to achieve desired levels of liquidity  manage interest rate sensitivity  meet earnings objectives  and provide required collateral support for deposit activities and treasury management overnight investment products 
excluding the us government sponsored agencies  we had no concentration of investment securities from any single issue that exceeded of shareholders equity

the bank also chose to allow high priced  volatile customer deposits to decline in order to allocate these resources to customers with full banking relationships 
the increase in deposits in resulted primarily from the bank s utilization of brokered certificates of deposits to fund the purchase of corporate bonds combined with the successful promotion of a month certificate of deposit offered during most of the increases were offset by the decline in non interest bearing and interest bearing demand deposits and savings accounts

growth of million in this area was offset by the loss of million from a local county government

management will continue to closely monitor interest rates within the context of its overall asset liability management process 
see the interest rate sensitivity section of this item for further discussion on this topic 
at december   we had additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb totaling million and an additional million of unused lines of credit with various financial institutions 
see note to consolidated financial statements  included in item of part ii of this annual report  for further details about our borrowings and additional borrowing capacity  which is incorporated herein by reference 
capital resources the bank and the corporation are subject to risk based capital regulations  which were adopted and monitored by federal banking regulators 
these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures  such as unused loan commitments and stand by letters of credit 
the regulatory guidelines require that a portion of total capital be tier i capital  consisting of common shareholders equity  qualifying portion of trust issued preferred securities  and perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other deductions 
the remaining capital  or tier ii capital  consists of elements such as subordinated debt  mandatory convertible debt  remaining portion of trust issued preferred securities  and grandfathered senior debt  plus the allowance for loan losses  subject to certain limitations 
under the risk based capital regulations  banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum for well capitalized banks total risk based capital ratio total qualifying capital divided by risk weighted assets  including a tier i ratio of for well capitalized banks 
the risk based capital rules have been further supplemented by a leverage ratio  defined as tier i capital divided by average assets  after certain adjustments 
the minimum leverage ratio is for well capitalized banks for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and have well diversified risk including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity and good earnings 
other banking organizations not in this category are expected to have ratios of at least  depending on their particular condition and growth plans 
higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization 
in the current regulatory environment  banking organizations must stay well capitalized in order to receive favorable regulatory treatment on acquisition and other expansion activities and favorable risk based deposit insurance assessments 
the corporation s capital policy establishes guidelines meeting these regulatory requirements  and takes into consideration current or anticipated risks as well as potential future growth opportunities 
at december   the corporation s total risk based capital ratio was  which was well above the regulatory minimum of 
the corporation s total risk based capital ratio for year end was 
as of december   the most recent notification from the regulators categorizes the corporation as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action

liquidity the asset and liability management committee of the corporation seeks to assess and manage the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates while maintaining adequate liquidity 
this is accomplished by formulating and implementing policies that take into account the sources and uses of funds  maturity and repricing distributions of assets and liabilities  pricing strategies  and marketability of assets 
the objective of liquidity management is to maintain sufficient funds to satisfy the needs of depositors and borrowers 
the principal sources of asset liquidity are cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits in banks  federal funds and investment securities available for sale that are not pledged 
at december   such liquid assets totaled million 
while much more difficult to quantify  liability liquidity is enhanced by a stable core deposit base  access to credit lines at other financial institutions  and the corporation s ability to renew maturing deposits 
the corporation s ability to attract deposits and borrow funds depends primarily on continued rate competitiveness  profitability  capitalization and overall financial condition 
when appropriate  we take advantage of external sources of funds  such as advances from the fhlb  lines of credit at other financial institutions and brokered funds 
these external sources often provide attractive interest rates and flexible maturity dates that better enable us to match funding dates and pricing characteristics with contractual maturity dates and pricing parameters of earning assets 
at december   our available borrowing capacity through the fhlb and other financial institutions was approximately million 
we actively manage our liquidity position under the direction of the asset and liability management committee of the corporation s board of directors 
monthly reviews by management and quarterly reviews by this committee under prescribed policies and procedures are intended to ensure that we will maintain adequate levels of available funds 
management believes that we have adequate liquidity available to respond to current and anticipated liquidity demands  which include future branch expansion and implementation of a new core processor 
management anticipates opening additional branches or expanding current facilities in its existing market footprint annually or bi annually for the next several years 
at the holding company level  the corporation uses cash to pay dividends to shareholders and to service its junior subordinated debt 
the main sources of funding for the holding company include dividends from the bank and access to the capital markets 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of part ii of this annual report  the bank is subject to significant regulation and  among other things  may be limited in its ability to pay dividends or transfer funds to the holding company 
accordingly  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available to the holding company 
during  the bank declared and paid dividends of million 
as of december   the amount of additional dividends that the bank could have paid to the corporation without regulatory approval was million 
interest rate sensitivity our primary market risk is interest rate fluctuation 
interest rate risk results primarily from the traditional banking activities that we engage in  such as gathering deposits and extending loans 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in interest rates and consumer preferences affect the difference between the interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on our liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the degree that earnings will be impacted by changes in the prevailing level of interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from mismatches in the repricing or maturity characteristics between interest bearing assets and liabilities 
management seeks to minimize fluctuating net interest margins  and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
management uses interest sensitivity gap analysis and simulation models to measure and manage these risks 
the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis assigns each interest earning asset and interest bearing liability to a time frame reflecting its next repricing or maturity date 
the differences between total interest sensitive assets and liabilities at each time interval represent the interest sensitivity gap for that interval 
a positive gap generally indicates that rising interest rates during a given interval will increase net interest income  as more assets than liabilities will reprice 
a negative gap position would benefit us during a period of declining interest rates 
in order to manage interest sensitivity risk  management formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments 
these guidelines are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
management uses computer simulations to measure the effect on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios 
key assumptions used in the computer simulations include cash flows and maturities of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  changes in asset volumes and pricing  and management s capital plans 
this modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net interest income over specified periods 
management has not historically used derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate sensitivity 
at december   the static gap analysis prepared by management indicated that we remain liability sensitive over the next year 
in computing the effect on net interest income of changes in interest rates  management has assumed that any changes would immediately affect earnings 
normally  when an organization is liability sensitive there is a negative impact to net interest income when interest rates increase 
based on the simulation analysis performed at december  and  management estimated the following changes in net interest income  assuming the indicated rate changes dollars in thousands basis point increase basis point increase basis point decrease this estimate is based on assumptions that may be affected by unforeseeable changes in the general interest rate environment and any number of unforeseeable factors 
rates on different assets and liabilities within a single maturity category adjust to changes in interest rates to varying degrees and over varying periods of time 
the relationships between lending rates and rates paid on purchased funds are not constant over time 
management can respond to current or anticipated market conditions by lengthening or shortening the corporation s sensitivity through loan repricings or changing its funding mix 
the rate of growth in interest free sources of funds will influence the level of interest sensitive funding sources 
in addition  the absolute level of interest rates will affect the volume of earning assets and funding sources 
as a result of these limitations  the interest sensitive gap is only one factor to be considered in estimating the net interest margin 
impact of inflation our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  and as such  future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money 
during inflationary periods  monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains 
the concept of purchasing power is not an adequate indicator of the impact of inflation on financial institutions because it does not incorporate changes in interest rates  which are an important determination of the corporation s earnings 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the following table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date and amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are legally binding  conditional agreements generally having fixed expiration or termination dates 
these commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards and are established based on management s credit assessment of the customer 
the commitments may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment does not necessarily represent future funding requirements 
further discussion of the nature of certain obligations and commitments is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements referenced in the table below  which are included in item of part ii of this annual report
