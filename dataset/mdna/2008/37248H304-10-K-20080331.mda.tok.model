overview we are an oil and gas company in the business of exploring and developing oil and natural gas reserves on a worldwide basis 
since inception  we have conducted leasehold acquisition  exploration and drilling activities on our north american  australian and indonesian prospects 
these projects currently encompass approximately  gross  net acres  consisting of mineral leases  production sharing contracts and exploration permits that give us the right to explore for  develop and produce oil and natural gas 
most of these properties are in the exploration  appraisal or development drilling phase and have not begun to produce revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas 
excluding minor interest and dividend income  our only significant cash inflows until were the recovery of capital invested in projects through sale or other divestiture of interests in oil and gas prospects to industry partners 
since  substantially all of our revenue has been generated from natural gas sales derived from the magness  the fannin  and the mitchell wells in the madisonville field in east texas under spot gas purchase contracts at market prices 
natural gas sales from the madisonville field are expected to account for substantially all of our revenues for we expect the majority of our capital expenditures in to be the costs of drilling and completing wells in the madisonville field 
for the years ended december  consolidated statement of operations revenues lease operating expense general and administrative net profits expense impairment expense depreciation and depletion expense earnings loss from operations net income loss net income loss attributable to common shareholders revenue and operating trends in as discussed in the properties texas madisonville project section in this prospectus  in order to produce the gas reserves from the rodessa formation  we developed an onsite plan to treat and remove impurities from the madisonville project natural gas in order to meet pipeline quality specifications 
in  the construction and installation of a natural gas treatment plant with a designed capacity of million cubic feet of gas per day mmcf d and associated pipeline and gathering facilities were completed 
the treatment plant and associated pipeline and gathering facilities are owned by an unaffiliated third party 
in we secured a commitment from mgp to install and make operational additional treating facilities capable of treating mmcf d  which combined with the capacity of the current in service treating facilities will represent a total designed treating capacity of mmcf d for the madisonville treatment plant 
in early october  mgp completed the additional treating facilities and the additional treating capacity at such facilities was being phased in 
in december  the phase in of operations at the additional treating facilities were suspended in order to make modifications to deal with the presence of diamondoids in the gas stream produced from the rodessa formation  which modifications are expected to be completed by the second quarter of upon completion of the phase in  we expect to produce our wells at a higher rate as the well rates have previously been restricted due to capacity limitations in the gas treatment plant 
in addition  we expect to fracture stimulate the wilson well in the second or third quarter of  and provided such stimulation is successful  we will place the wilson well on production 
in addition  our contract with mgp provides that for the first  mcf d of gas measured and delivered to the inlet flange of the gas treatment plant  mgp will receive a treating fee of per thousand cubic feet mcf this fee is presently per mcf adjusted for inflation 
for any gas volumes in excess of  mcf d of gas delivered to the inlet flange of the gas treatment plant  the treating fee received by mgp is reduced from to per mcf per mcf adjusted for inflation 
we record our revenues net of these treating fees 
thus  if we are able to increase our inlet production volumes over mmcf d on a sustained basis  we expect to experience a disproportionately higher increase in revenue due to lower average treating fees per mcf 
while there can be no assurance  the higher production rates from our wells combined with the lower average treating fees per mcf  may result in higher net production and increased revenue during as compared to and prior periods 
industry overview for the year ended december  the twelve months ended december  saw strengthening natural gas prices 
the houston ship channel price  the index price prevailing in the locale of our madisonville project in madison county  texas  as quoted in gas daily as of december   was per mcf versus per mcf as of december  natural gas prices improved during the year due to higher demand induced by cold temperatures experienced in many parts of the united states  among other factors 
company overview in our net loss after taxes for the year ended december  was  from our inception  through mid  we only received nominal revenues from our oil and natural gas activities  while incurring substantial acquisition and exploration costs and overhead expenses which have resulted in an accumulated deficit through december  of  commencing in may  we placed our madisonville project into production 
substantially all of our oil and natural gas sales for the year ended december  were derived from our madisonville project  from three producing wells  the umc ruby magness well the magness well  the angela farris fannin well the fannin well  and the mitchell well the mitchell well 
comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  and during the twelve months ended december   we had oil and natural gas revenues of  our net production was  mcf of natural gas at an average price of per mcf 
during the twelve months ended december   we had oil and natural gas revenues of  our net production for the twelve months ended december  was  mcf at an average price of per mcf 
revenues increased in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the prior year period due to higher gas prices but lower production volumes 
prices were approximately higher for the twelve months ended december  versus the same period in during the twelve months ended december   we incurred lease operating expense of  our average lifting cost for the period was per mcf 
during the twelve months ended december   we incurred lease operating expense of  our average lifting cost for the period was per mcf 
the average lifting cost per mcf in was lower due to higher production volume in during the twelve months ended december   we incurred net profits interest expense of  associated with the magness  the fannin  and the mitchell wells as compared to  during the twelve months ended december  the increase resulted from higher gas prices in the twelve months ended december  versus the net profit interest is of the net operating profit from our magness  fannin  and mitchell wells 
general and administrative g a expenses for the twelve months ended december  were  compared to  for the twelve months ended december  this represents a  increase over the prior year period due primarily to us and canada public company filing fees  costs associated with our sec registration statement  and ongoing filing requirements 
the  increase over the prior year period due to primarily to  in filing fees related to our sec registration   public company filing fees in us and canada  ongoing filing requirements and costs associated with sec compliance 
for the year ended december   impairment expense was incurred in amount of  as compared to  in the same period of the and impairment write downs were due to dry holes drilled associated with the canadian oil and gas properties  which resulted in ceiling test write downs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a for the twelve months ended december  was  as compared to  in the same period of  which amounts primarily represent amortization of the oil and gas properties for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was due to lower net production in the twelve months period of and an increase in the amount of capitalized cost in the us oil and gas properties 
loss from operations totaled  for the twelve months ended december  as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in the loss from operations was due primarily to higher g a cost and impairment expense associated with the canadian oil and gas properties in the twelve months ended december  versus other income for the twelve months ended december  and consisted of interest income in the amount of  and  respectively 
the reason for the decreased interest income was lower average cash and cash equivalent balances during the period as compared to period 
during the twelve months ended december  and  we incurred interest expense of  and  respectively 
the interest expense comparisons between the year ended and were relatively consistent 
net loss before taxes for the twelve months ended december  was  as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in net loss during the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to higher g a cost and canadian impairment write off in the twelve months ended december  versus income tax refund for the twelve months ended december  was  compared to income tax expense of  in the same period of income tax benefit in was due to a refund of prior year alternative minimum tax paid offset by a current year state tax payable 
industry overview for the year ended december  the year saw softening natural gas prices 
the houston ship channel price  the index price prevailing in the locale of our madisonville project in madison county  texas  as quoted in gas daily as of december   was versus as of december  in the year of  the natural gas prices were strong as a result of hurricane related supply disruptions and generally tight supplies of natural gas in the united states 
availability of capital  particularly equity capital for junior oil and natural gas companies  continued to show improvement in as a result of the initial public offering in canada in march  we were able to drill two wells in our madisonville project during company overview in our net loss after taxes for the year ended december  was  from our inception  through mid  we only received nominal revenues from our oil and natural gas activities  while incurring substantial acquisition and exploration costs and overhead expenses which have resulted in an accumulated deficit through december  of  commencing in may  we placed our madisonville project into production 
substantially all of our oil and natural gas sales for the year ended december  were derived from our madisonville project  from two producing wells  the umc ruby magness well the magness well and the angela farris fannin well the fannin well 
comparison of results of operations for the twelve months ended december  and during the twelve months ended december   we had oil and natural gas revenues of  our net production was  thousand cubic feet mcf of natural gas at an average price of per mcf 
during the twelve months ended december   we had oil and natural gas revenues of  our net production for the twelve months ended december  was  mcf at an average price of per mcf 
revenues decreased in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the prior year period due to lower gas prices in spite of higher production volumes 
prices were approximately lower for the twelve months ended december  versus the same period in during the twelve months ended december   we incurred lease operating expenses of  our average lifting cost for the period was per mcf 
during the twelve months ended december   we incurred lease operating expenses of  our average lifting cost for the period was per mcf 
the higher average lifting cost in was due to higher lease operating costs and production taxes attributable to the fannin well 
the primary reason for the increase in average lifting cost per mcf were increases in production costs related to the fannin well which was placed in production in march the production for the magness and the fannin wells is at present limited to the current treatment plant s capacity of up to  mcf d 
therefore  the production from the fannin and the magness wells is limited to a rate that is below the combined productive flow capability of the wells 
a majority of the lease operating costs are fixed costs such as chemical treatments for the wells  insurance  ad valorem tax  and salaries paid to the field personnel 
during the twelve months ended december   the total lease operating costs for the magness well were  versus  in the same period of the net production of the magness well was  mcf for the twelve months ended december  compared to  mcf in same period of some of the production decrease is attributable to natural declines and some of the decrease is attributable to the fact that the magness well shared the treating capacity of the treatment plant with the fannin well in whereas in the comparable period it did not 
as a result  the average lifting cost for magness well was per mcf for the twelve months ended december  versus per mcf in the same period of the fannin well s average lifting cost was higher than the magness well due mainly to the severance tax of  which was incurred on the fannin well for the twelve months ended december  the magness well is exempt from the severance tax 
the average lifting cost for the fannin well was per mcf for the twelve months ended december  during the twelve months ended december   we incurred net profits interest expense of  associated with the magness and fannin wells as compared to  during the twelve months ended december  the decrease resulted from lower net revenues from the wells in the twelve months ended december  versus the net profits interest is of the net operating profits from our magness and fannin wells 
general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  were  compared to  for the twelve months ended december  this represents a  increase over the prior year period due to primarily to  of stock based compensation  a  increase in directors and officers liability insurance   in filing fees related to our public listing on the toronto stock exchange  and  in legal  audit  printing and filing fees associated with the s registration statement which was prepared for the resale of some of our common stock 
for the year ended december   impairment expense was incurred in amount of  as compared to in the same period of the impairment write downs were associated with the canadian cost pool 
the remaining costs of drilling a dry hole in canada of  were expensed in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  also known as dd a  for the twelve months ended december  was  as compared to  in the same period of  which amounts represent amortization of the us full cost pool for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was due to higher net production in the twelve months period of and an increase in the amount of capitalized cost in the us full cost pool 
loss from operations totaled  for the twelve months ended december  as compared to income from operations of  for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in the income from operations was due primarily to lower gas prices  higher lease operating expenses  and higher g a expenses 
other income for the twelve months ended december  and consisted of interest income in the amount of  and  respectively 
the reason for the increased interest income was higher average cash and cash equivalent balances during period as compared to period resulting from net proceeds received from common stock offerings completed by us in during the twelve months ended december  and  we incurred interest expense of  and  respectively 
the higher interest expense in the current year period was due to  in expense related to the amortization of debt issuance costs in connection with a debt financing in january consisting of i the fair market value assigned to common stock warrants issued  and ii a loan origination fee paid 
net loss before taxes for the twelve months ended december  was  as compared to net income before taxes of  for the twelve months ended december  the loss incurred during was primarily due to lower gas income  higher lease operating expenses as well as higher general and administrative costs 
income tax expense for the twelve months ended december  was  compared to  in the same period of the increased income tax expense was due to alternative minimum tax paid in industry overview for the year ended december  the year saw continued strong natural gas prices as a result of hurricane related supply disruptions and generally tight supplies of natural gas in the united states 
the houston ship channel price  the index price prevailing in the locale of our madisonville project in madison county  texas  as quoted in gas daily as of december   was versus as of december  availability of capital  particularly equity capital for junior oil and natural gas companies  continued to show improvement in  and in  we raised  net of issuance costs through equity financing transactions 
as a result  and through the sale of one of our indonesian property interests  we were able to repay our indebtedness of million to various creditors and improve our capital position during during  we received a weighted average net price of per mcf of gas sold 
as further discussed under properties texas madisonville project  we receive revenue for our gas sales net of certain costs to treat and transport the gas 
the weighted average gross price during  prior to the deduction of the treating and transportation costs  was 
this compares to which was the price prevailing on the last day of company overview in our net income for the year ended december  was  from our inception to  we only received nominal revenues from our oil and natural gas activities  while incurring substantial acquisition and exploration costs and overhead expenses which resulted in our sustaining an accumulated deficit through december  of  we placed our madisonville project into production in may substantially all of our oil and natural gas sales for the year ended december  were derived from our madisonville project  from one producing well  the magness well 
comparison of results of operations for the twelve months ended december  and during the year ended december   we had oil and natural gas revenues of  our net production was  thousand cubic feet mcf of natural gas at an average price of per mcf 
during the year ended december   we had oil and natural gas revenues of  our net production for the year ended december  was  mcf at an average price of per mcf 
revenues increased in the year ended december  as compared to the prior period due to higher gas prices 
average prices in were higher than  more than offsetting the drop in production from to production was lower due to normal declines associated with the production of reserves from the magness well 
during the year ended december   we incurred lease operating expenses of  our average lifting cost for this period was per mcf 
during the year ended december   we incurred lease operating expenses of  our average lifting cost for this period was per mcf 
the primary reasons for the increase in average lifting cost per mcf were increases in costs and lower net production 
the increase in lease operating costs was due primarily to higher insurance premiums  approximately  and higher costs of chemical treatments  approximately  associated with the magness well 
during the year ended december   we incurred net profits interest expense of  associated with the magness well compared to  during the year ended december  the increase resulted from higher revenues associated with the magness well in versus general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  this represents a  decrease over the prior year period due to stock based compensation incurred in during we issued  shares of our common stock for cash proceeds of  in connection with the exercise of stock options by an officer and director 
concurrent with the exercise of stock options  the officer sold  shares of common stock to us at the estimated fair market value price prevailing at that time of per share 
we recorded compensation expense of  in connection with the purchase of stock 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense for the year ended december  was  compared to  in the year ended december   which amounts represent amortization of the us full cost pool for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was due to lower net production in as well as an upward revision in net proved reserve estimates during the year 
for the year ended december   no impairment expense was incurred as compared to  for the year ended december  the impairment write downs were associated with the canadian and australian cost pools 
we expensed the costs of drilling dry holes in those areas during while no such costs associated with unsuccessful wells were incurred in earnings from operations totaled  for the year ended december  compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  the increase in the earnings from operations was due primarily to higher revenues associated with the magness well 
other income for the year ended december  and consisted of interest income in the amount of  and  respectively 
the reason for the increase was higher average cash and cash equivalents balances for the period as compared to during the year ended december  and  we incurred interest expense of  and  respectively 
the lower interest expense in the current year period was due to lower average debt levels 
in march  we incurred a cash finders fee of  to a director associated with the negotiation of a reduction in debt through the conversion of  of long term debt to equity 
net income after taxes for the year ended december  was  compared to net loss of  for the year ended december  the increase in net income was primarily due to higher revenues associated with the magness well and the impairments expense recorded in the previous period 
recent developments in december  officers  directors  and an employee exercised cashless options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
a cashless exercise is the security holder s election to receive that number of shares of our common stock that is equal to the quotient of i the fair market value of such shares  less the exercise price then in effect  multiplied by the number of shares that the security holder would otherwise have been entitled to purchase or such lesser number of shares as the security holder may designate in the case of a partial exercise  over ii the fair market value 
the requisite tax withholdings for those persons employed by us at the time of exercise were taken in shares of common stock and the company paid to the taxing authorities the amounts required to be withheld in cash equal to the value of the withheld shares 
on august   we sold  pursuant to a private placement   units of our securities at a price of per unit for gross proceeds of  the placement agent also received a warrant to purchase  shares expiring august  for additional gross proceeds of 
each unit consists of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase three tenths of a common share

specifically  the agreement provides that we will be paid consideration for the sale and transfer of our property interests as follows initial cash consideration of  subject to certain closing conditions  a second cash payment of  upon a successful flow test of petroleum from a well located on the property interests 
a successful flow test is defined for purposes of this agreement to be a test of at least million standard cubic feet of natural gas for a continuous and uninterrupted hour period or an equivalent oil condensate rate based on a conversion ratio of cubic feet of gas to a barrel of oil or condensate  and  a petroleum sales royalty payment equal to of the future annual earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization from the property interests up to a total amount of the first cash payment of  was received on november  during  we participated  for a non operated working interest  in the drilling of three wells in alberta  two of which were determined to be non commercial and one of which is currently under evaluation 
on october   we acquired a non operated working interest in the swan hills prospect  central alberta  canada 
we paid  to purchase  gross  net acres in this prospect 
liquidity and capital resources we had a working capital surplus of  versus a working capital deficit of  at december  and december   respectively 
our working capital increased during year ended december  due primarily to a private placement which is discussed below 
we have historically financed our business activities through december  principally through issuances of common shares  promissory notes and common share purchase warrants in private placements and an initial public offering 
these financings are summarized as follows years ended december  december  december  proceeds from sale of common shares and warrant exercises  net payment on preferred dividends repayments of promissory notes proceeds from promissory notes payment of loan fee repayment of related party note deferred offering costs purchase of treasury stocks net option exercise net cash provided by financing activities the net proceeds of our equity financings have been primarily invested in oil and natural gas properties totaling   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively

our cash balance at december  was  compared to a cash balance of  at december  the change in our cash balance is summarized as follows cash balance at december  sources of cash cash provided by operating activities cash provided by financing activities cash provided by related party note cash provided by selling interests in australia total sources of cash including cash on hand uses of cash cash used in investing activities oil and natural gas property expenditures furniture  fixtures and equipment total uses of cash cash balance at december  during january and february  we conducted a private placement of common shares to accredited investors 
we issued  common shares at per share for gross cash proceeds of  net of on january   we borrowed  from pinehill capital inc pursuant to an promissory note with a maturity date of january  we issued  shares at per share of no par voting common stock warrants  immediately exercisable with an expiration date on january  to pinehill capital inc  as well as a  loan origination fee 
the fair market value of the warrants on the date of issuance   as well as the  loan origination fee  was recorded as a debt discount and is being amortized over the life of the promissory note 
on february   the maturity date was extended to october  we paid  accrued interest thru january  in connection with the extension  we paid a loan extension fee of  and granted a three year warrant exercisable to purchase  common shares at per share 
the fair value of the warrants on the date of issuance   together with the  loan extension fee  were recorded as a debt discount and are being amortized over the life of the promissory note 
as of june   the unamortized debt discount was  in the event this note is not repaid by the maturity date  and unless an extension thereof is mutually agreed to  then we have agreed that we shall dedicate of our net cash flow from the madisonville field toward the unpaid principal amount and all accrued and unpaid interest thereon  until such amounts are paid in full 
net cash flow for purposes of this provision means gross revenues received by us less royalties  production taxes and net profits interest expense 
the note plus the accrued interest were paid in full on october  on march   we completed an initial public offering pursuant to a final prospectus under the securities laws of each of the provinces of canada  which consisted of  common shares from our treasury at an issue price of per common share and  common shares issued on a flow through basis under the income tax act of canada at an issue price of per common share for aggregate gross proceeds of  we used the net proceeds of the offering to fund development drilling of proven and probable natural gas reserves associated with the madisonville project and to conduct exploration and appraisal activities on our other projects in the united states  canada and indonesia 
it was required that we expend  of the proceeds realized from the canadian offering from the issuance of  flow through shares toward canadian exploration expense pursuant to canadian tax law 
canadian exploration expense generally means  but is not limited to  the drilling of exploratory wells in canada 
pursuant to the terms of our agreement with the subscribers of the flow through shares  we must renounce the tax deductions which would result from these expenditures and pass the deductions through to the holders of these shares 
we incurred these expenditures by the end of our fiscal year ended december  on august  we completed a private placement consisting of  units of the company at a subscription price of per unit for total proceeds of  each unit consisted of one share of common stock of the company and three tenths common share purchase warrant of the company 
each one whole warrant entitles the holder to acquire one share of common stock at a price of per share for a period of five years from the closing date 
the units were purchased by a group of private investors 
the proceeds of the sale of common shares will be used to fund the company s exploration and development program and for general working capital purposes 
our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditures and growth strategy requirements for the foreseeable future 
see outlook for for a description of our expected capital expenditures for if we are unable to generate revenues necessary to finance our operations over the long term  we may have to seek additional capital through the sale of our equity or borrowing 
as noted in recent developments  we periodically borrow funds pursuant to short term promissory notes to finance our activities 
as discussed in the outlook for  we are forecasting capital expenditures of million during we will need to obtain adequate sources of cash to fund our anticipated capital expenditures through the end of and to follow through with plans for continued investments in oil and gas properties 
our success  in part  depends on our ability to generate additional financing and farm out certain of our projects 
since our inception  we have participated as a working interest owner in the acquisition of undeveloped leases  seismic options  lease options and foreign concessions and have participated in seismic surveys and the drilling of test wells on our undeveloped properties 
further leasehold acquisitions  drilling and seismic operations are planned for and future periods 
in addition  exploratory and development drilling is scheduled during and future periods on our undeveloped properties 
it is anticipated that these exploration activities together with others that may be entered into will impose financial requirements which will exceed our existing working capital 
we may raise additional equity and or debt capital  and we may farm out certain of our projects to finance our continued participation in planned activities 
however  if additional financing is not available  we may be compelled to reduce the scope of our business activities 
if we are unable to fund planned expenditures  it may be necessary to forfeit our interest in wells that are proposed to be drilled  farm out our interest in proposed wells  sell a portion of our interest in prospects and use the sale proceeds to fund our participation for a lesser interest  and reduce general and administrative expenses 
contractual obligations a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  is provided in the following table payments due by period less than more than total year years years years operating lease obligations madisonville field drilling obligation cook inlet alaska work program total effective march   geopetro is committed under an office sublease which provides for a sixty month term 
the sublease is cancelable by either party after thirty six months 
minimum annual rentals due under this agreement are  in and  in in order to facilitate the expansion of the gas treatment plant in our madisonville project  we are subject to a drilling commitment 
the commitment  subject to events of force majeure  including  but not limited to rig availability  requires us to drill a well sufficient to test the smackover formation estimated to be encountered at approximately  feet on or before september  the commitment is not discretionary 
we have granted mgp a security interest in the madisonville field properties to secure the commitment 
the security interest shall be subordinated to any third party lender in the event we secure future debt against the property 
mgp granted us a security interest in the madisonville field gas treatment plant to secure their obligation to expand the capacity of the facilities 
on or before november   we have the option to conduct a million work program on the leases over a three year period  and  after completion of the work program and an evaluation of the results  to remit the final additional acreage consideration of per acre for the leases estimated at approximately  the cook inlet option provides that if we fail to pay the lease consideration when due  fail to perform the work program or otherwise default under the cook inlet option  we shall forfeit our interest and reassign the leases to pioneer with no further liability to us 
this table does not include the liability for dismantlement  abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties 
effective with the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  we recorded a separate liability for the fair value of this asset retirement obligation 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
other than the above commitments  the timing of most of our capital expenditures is discretionary 
we have no other material long term commitments associated with our capital expenditure plans or operating agreements 
consequently  we have a significant degree of flexibility to adjust the level of such expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the level of capital expenditures will vary in future periods depending on the success we experience on planned exploratory and appraisal drilling activities  natural gas and oil price conditions and other related economic and political factors 
accordingly  we have not yet prepared an estimate of capital expenditures for periods beyond income taxes as of december   geopetro had net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately  for federal income tax purposes which begin to expire in however  in accordance with sfas r  a deferred tax asset has not been recognized for the portion of the net operating loss carryforwards that is attributable to excess tax deductions associated with the exercise of stock options in which do not reduce income taxes payable 
accordingly   of the geopetro s federal nol has not been benefited for financial statement purposes as it relates to excess tax deductions that have not reduced income taxes payable 
the benefit of these excess tax deductions will not be recognized for financial statement purposes until the related deductions reduce income taxes payable 
the company also has  of california and alaska net operating losses which begin to expire in in accordance with sfas r  a portion of the state nols has similarly not been benefited for financial statement purposes as it relates to excess tax deductions which have not resulted in the reduction of income taxes payable 
the benefit of such excess tax deductions will not be recognized for financial statement purposes until the related deductions reduce state income taxes payable 
in addition  the company has  of carryforward credits in texas  a portion of which may be utilized each year against texas margin tax liability through a significant change in our ownership may limit our ability to use these nol carryforwards 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that the tax benefit of such net operating loss be recorded as an asset 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million related to the nol and other temporary differences 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance of million at december  due to uncertainties surrounding the realizability of the deferred tax asset 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  the detail of which is included in note to the financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements as of march   we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
financial instruments we currently have no natural gas price financial instruments or hedges in place 
similarly  we have no financial derivatives 
our natural gas marketing contracts use spot market prices 
given the uncertainty of the timing and volumes of our natural gas production this year  we do not currently plan to enter into any long term fixed price natural gas contracts  swap or hedge positions  other gas financial instruments or financial derivatives in outlook for depending on capital availability  we are forecasting capital spending of up to approximately million during the year  allocated as follows madisonville project  madison county  texas 
approximately million may be expended in the madisonville field area as follows million toward the fracture stimulation and hook up costs of the wilson well and million toward the drilling of a deep well 
central alberta project 
up to approximately million may be expended to drill an exploratory well in the swan hills prospect 
cook inlet  alaska 
up to million may be expended toward the drilling and completion of one exploratory well and an additional million to be utilized for land acquisition and geologic and geophysical costs 
indonesia 
up to million may be expended toward the drilling  completion and testing of wells as well as the acquisition of seismic data in the bengara ii psc as well as acquisition costs associated with new ventures 
we may  in our discretion  decide to allocate resources towards other projects in addition to or in lieu of  those listed above should other opportunities arise and as circumstances warrant 
we currently do not have sufficient working capital to fund all of the capital expenditure listed above 
see liquidity and capital resources 
we expect commodity prices to be volatile  reflecting the current tight supply and demand fundamentals for north american natural gas and world crude oil 
political events around the world  which are difficult to predict  will continue to influence both oil and gas prices 
higher prices for oil and gas often lead to higher levels of drilling activity which in turn lead to higher costs to explore  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves due to greater competition for resources and supplies 
these higher costs could affect the returns on our capital expenditures 
higher crude prices could also help keep natural gas prices high by keeping alternative fuels  such as heating oil and residual fuel  expensive 
impact of inflation changing prices as the following table illustrates  average sales prices of natural gas have changed in the past three years 
this has led to changes in revenues and earnings from operations for the year ended december  average sales prices per mcf net production volume mcf revenues earnings loss from operation includes  impairment expense includes  impairment expense we are highly dependent upon natural gas pricing 
a material decrease in current and projected natural gas prices could impair our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms 
likewise  a material decrease in current and projected natural gas prices could also impact our revenues and cash flows 
this could impact our ability to fund future activities 
geopetro anticipates an increase in gas price in from this would have a materially positive impact on our cash flow and revenues 
changing prices have had a significant impact on costs of drilling and completing wells  particularly in the madisonville field area where we are currently the most active 
the estimated cost of drilling and completing a rodessa formation well at approximately  feet of depth has increased from million in to million in due to higher costs associated with tubular goods  well equipment  and day rates for drilling contracts  among other factors 
these higher costs have impacted and will continue to impact our income from operations in the form of higher depletion expense 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the most critical accounting policies that may have an impact on our financial results relate to the accounting for oil and gas properties 
amortization  abandonment costs and full cost ceiling limitation write downs are all based on numerous estimates  many of which are beyond management s control 
reserves valuation is central to much of the accounting for an oil and gas company as described below 
significant accounting policies are contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a summary of unaudited supplementary oil and gas reserve information is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discusses the accounting estimates that are critical in determining the reported financial results oil and gas properties we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as prescribed by us gaap and  accordingly  capitalize all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development drilling of proved oil and gas properties  including the costs of abandoned properties  dry holes  geophysical costs  and lease rentals 
all general corporate costs are expensed as incurred 
in general  sales or other dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recorded 
amortization of evaluated oil and gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on all proved reserves on a country by country basis 
unevaluated oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment either individually or on an aggregate basis 
the net capitalized costs of evaluated oil and gas properties full cost ceiling limitation are not to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at  and the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties  net of tax considerations 
reserves we engage independent petroleum engineering consultants to evaluate our reserves 
reserves  future production profiles  and net revenues are estimated by independent professional reservoir engineering firms 
while we engage qualified reservoir engineering firms  their estimates are inherently uncertain  involve numerous assumptions that may not be realized  and predict asset values that may not be indicative of the true market value of the assets evaluated 
as a result of the inherent uncertainties and changing technical and economic assumptions  reserve estimates are subject to revisions that can materially impact our results 
asset retirement obligation we provide for the estimated site restoration and abandonment costs of tangible long lived assets using a fair value method  which approximates the cost a third party would incur in performing the tasks necessary to retire such assets 
the reported liability is a discounted amount 
the amount of the liability is affected by factors such as the number of wells  the timing of the expected expenditures and the discount factor 
these estimates will change and the revisions could impact the amortization rates 
stock based compensation the company has a stock based compensation plan that allows employees to purchase common shares of the company 
option exercise prices approximate the market price for the common shares on the date the options were issued 
options granted under the plan are generally fully exercisable after five years and expire five to ten years after the grant date 
under us gaap  prior to  the company elected not to expense compensation cost for stock based employee compensation at fair value but did disclose the impact of the fair value accounting of employee stock options in note to the annual audited consolidated financial statements 
geopetro adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r statement r on january   which is the beginning of its first interim period following the effective date of statement r 
geopetro has applied the modified prospective method of adoption  and accordingly  the financial statements for geopetro s prior interim periods and fiscal years will not reflect any restated amounts 
geopetro has recorded  and  of stock based employee compensation for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  in connection with the portion of previously granted employee stock options that vest on or after january  the impact of the fair value accounting of employee stock options is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with assumptions for risk free interest rates  expected dividend yields  expected life of the options from the date of grant  and expected volatility 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which is effective for the company beginning january  and provides a definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements for future transactions 
we do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits an entity to measure certain financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to improve financial reporting by allowing entities to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by the measurement of related assets and liabilities using different attributes  without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
under sfas no 
 entities that elect the fair value option by instrument will report unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option election is irrevocable  unless a new election date occurs 
sfas no 
establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to help financial statement users understand the effect of the entity s election on its earnings  but does not eliminate disclosure requirements of other accounting standards 
assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value must be displayed on the face of the balance sheet 
we do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
risks and uncertainties there are a number of risks that face participants in the us  canadian and international oil and natural gas industry  including a number of risks that face us in particular 
accordingly  there are risks involved in an ownership of our securities 
see risk factors for a description of the principal risks faced by us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks arising from fluctuating prices of crude oil  natural gas and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity risk 
our major commodity price risk exposure is to the prices received for our natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for our production are the spot prices applicable to natural gas in the east texas region 
prices received for natural gas are volatile and unpredictable and are beyond our control 
for the year ended december   a change in the prices received for natural gas production would have had an approximate  impact on our revenues 
currency translation risk 
because our revenues and expenses are primarily in us dollars  we have little exposure to currency translation risk  and  therefore  we have no plans in the foreseeable future to implement hedges or financial instruments to manage international currency changes 
hedging 
we did not enter into any hedging transactions during the years ended december  and
