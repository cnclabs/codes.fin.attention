r revised  sfas r  business combinations  which replaces sfas the statement provides a broader definition of the acquirer and establishes principles and requirements of how the acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as how the acquirer recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements contained herein  the company makes estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenue  operating income and net income  as well as on the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
the company believes that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on its financial statements due to the materiality of the accounts involved  and therefore  considers these to be its critical accounting policies 
estimates in each of these areas are based on historical experience and a variety of assumptions that the company believes are appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable the company makes ongoing assumptions relating to the collectibility of its accounts receivable 
the accounts receivable amount on the balance sheet includes a reserve for accounts that might not be paid 
in determining the amount of the reserve  the company considers its historical level of credit losses 
the company also makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations  and it assesses current economic trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future 
the company recorded reserves for uncollectible accounts receivables of  as of december   which is equal to approximately of total accounts receivable 
while the company believes that the current reserves are adequate to cover potential credit losses  it cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of its customers and the company cannot guarantee that its reserves will continue to be adequate 
for each that actual credit losses exceed the reserves established  there would be an increase in general and administrative expenses and a reduction in reported net income of approximately  conversely  for each that actual credit losses are less than the reserve  this would decrease the company s general and administrative expenses and increase the reported net income by approximately  fixed assets fixed assets are stated at cost 
depreciation for financial reporting purposes is being provided by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
historically  impairment losses have not been required 
any change in the assumption of estimated useful lives could either result in a decrease or increase the company s financial results 
a decrease in estimated useful life would reduce the company s net income and an increase in estimated useful life would increase the company s net income 
if the estimated useful lives of the pers medical device were decreased by one year  the cost of goods related to services would increase and net income would decrease by approximately  conversely  if the estimated useful lives of the pers medical device were increased by one year  the cost of goods related to services would decrease and net income would increase by approximately  valuation of goodwill pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets are no longer amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
to date  the company has not been required to recognize an impairment of goodwill 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances occur  indicating goodwill might be impaired 
this process involves estimating fair value using discounted cash flow analyses 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows 
assumptions used for these estimated cash flows were based on a combination of historical results and current internal forecasts 
the company cannot predict certain events that could adversely affect the reported value of goodwill  which totaled  at december  and  at december  if the company were to experience a significant adverse impact on goodwill  it would negatively impact the company s net income 
accounting for stock based awards on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment 
prior to january   the company had applied the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options granted to our employees and directors under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  employee and director compensation expense was recognized only for those options whose exercise price was less than the market value of our common stock at the measurement date 
the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective method  i compensation expense for share based awards granted prior to january  are recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under sfas no 
and ii compensation expense for all share based awards granted subsequent to december  are based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
results for periods prior to january  have not been restated 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r  the company recorded a pre tax expense of approximately  and  for stock based compensation for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards to employees and directors on the date of grant using the black scholes model is affected by the company s stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors
