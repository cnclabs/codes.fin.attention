furthermore  despite our success in winning long term outsourcing arrangements with several clients  the sales cycles for these arrangements have ranged from twelve to twenty four months 
for these reasons  coupled with the fact that we are in the early stages with many of our outsourcing arrangements  where margins tend to be lower  we have generated significant operating losses over the past few years 
demand for human resource outsourcing is strong and we are one of the leaders in the large and growing human resource outsourcing market 
based on the contracts signed to date and opportunities in our sales pipeline  we remain confident that we will become profitable with this business in the future

business outlook in  we are taking action in many areas that have the ability to drive overall growth in revenue and operating income 
we expect revenues of to billion  and earnings per share between and  despite the potential for some short term disruption from a challenging economic environment 
expectations for customer management include a year over year increase in revenue of approximately seven to twelve percent  consistent with expected industry growth  and operating margin of approximately ten percent for the full year 
on a sequential basis  first quarter revenue and profitability will be approximately the same as the fourth quarter of year over year comparison of customer management operating performance in the first quarter of will be negatively impacted by the basis point margin benefit in the first quarter of related to a one time resolution of a prior cost 
we expect to see strong sequential and year over year quarterly revenue growth in the second half of the year  once new large client programs are fully ramped 
the negative impact of the weakened us dollar on operating income for will be significantly higher than the impact of approximately expectations for information management include revenues of approximately and an operating margin exceeding for the full year 
after a significant  more than year over year  decline in revenue in the first quarter  largely due to north american billing platform consolidation  we expect information management revenues to be relatively flat over the course of the year 
expectations for hr management include revenues of approximately and an operating loss improvement to less than for the full year 
sequentially  revenue will decline slightly in the first quarter of due to completion of open enrollments and some legacy programs 
we expect modest sequential and year over year quarterly revenue growth in the second half of the year as we begin recognizing revenue upon completion of a key implementation phase for a large client 
we expect to see a substantial reduction in our operating loss in the second half of the year because of this large implementation 
for the full year  cash flow from operations should exceed and free cash flow should be in line with net income 
to be successful in  there are challenges and opportunities we must address 
challenges in include offsetting market based labor cost increases in customer management with productivity improvements  increasing asset utilization across multiple geographies to counter the negative impact of the weak us dollar  delivering hr management implementations on time and on budget over convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the course of the year to successfully reach key go live milestones  and growing information management international operations to offset the north american revenue declines 
opportunities for growth in revenue  operating income and earnings per share include customer management revenue growth from recent wins  volume and price increases with existing clients  and new client ramps from the strong pipeline  further customer management operational efficiencies through improved agent training  agent retention and asset utilization  successfully completing hr management implementations which will improve results in the second half of the year  stabilization and continuing improvement with hr management clients in early stage operations  and further streamlining of information management costs to better fit its software and services business model 
we will also continue to identify and take additional cost actions across the company 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources liquidity and cash flows cash flows from operating activities provided us with a significant source of funding for our investing and financing activities 
also  we have borrowing facilities available  including a million five year revolving credit facility to fund these activities 
see further discussion of these borrowing facilities under the next section titled  capital resources  off balance sheet arrangements and contractual commitments 
summarized cash flow information for the three years ended december   and was as follows net cash flows from operations net cash flows used in investing net cash flows from used in financing computation of free cash flows net cash flows from operations change in accounts receivable securitization capital expenditures  net of proceeds from disposal of assets free cash flows cash flows from operating activities totaled in  compared to in and in compared to the prior year  the decline in cash flows from operating activities was driven by changes in working capital 
the working capital increases were mostly due to lower bonus accruals in  a decrease in advance billing amounts in and the timing of both accounts payable and restructuring payments 
also in  the increase in deferred charges  net of amortization and implementation revenue received  related to client implementations incurred primarily at hr management was approximately the increase in cash flows from operating activities during was driven by improvements in working capital 
in addition  during  there was a net decrease in accounts receivable sold under the securitization program 
during  we terminated the securitization program and there were no accounts receivable sold under the securitization program 
these improvements were partially offset by an increase in deferred charges related to client implementations incurred primarily at hr management 
we used for investing activities during compared to in and in the decrease in amounts used in investing activities during was due to the sale of our short term investments 
the company used in cash flow for capital expenditures during compared to during the decrease in amounts used for investing activities during compared to was due to lower amounts utilized on acquisitions and net capital expenditures

in connection with the implementation of the existing hr management contracts  we expect to continue to incur a significant amount of implementation costs and  in  deferred charges  net of implementation revenue received  will be significantly more than the amount incurred during this will negatively impact cash flows from operation and free cash flows 
as further described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company expects to make payments of approximately related to its pension plans in this compares to approximately in excluding funding requirements related to acquisitions  we believe that our cash flows from operations and available capital resources will be sufficient to fund these investments 
at this point  we are not aware of any capital calls from the general partner of cincinnati smsa limited partnership 
the company s free cash flow  defined as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures net of proceeds related to disposals  was  and for  and  respectively 
compared to the prior year  the decrease in free cash flow of was due to a decrease in cash flow from operating activities during the company uses free cash flow to assess the financial performance of the company 
the company believes that free cash flow is useful to investors because it relates the operating cash flow of the company to the capital that is spent to continue and improve business operations  such as investment in the company s existing businesses 
further  free cash flow facilitates management s ability to strengthen the company s balance sheet  to repurchase the company s common shares and to repay the company s debt obligations 
limitations associated with the use of free cash flow include that it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as it does not incorporate certain cash payments including payments made on capital lease obligations or cash payments for business acquisitions 
management compensates for these limitations by utilizing both the non gaap measure  free cash flow  and the gaap measure  cash from operating activities  in its evaluation of performance 
there are no material purposes for which we use this non gaap measure beyond the purposes described above

at december  and  the senior notes had an outstanding balance of and  respectively 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we lease certain facilities and equipment used in our operations under operating leases 
this includes our office complex in orlando  florida  which is leased from wachovia development corporation lessor  a wholly owned subsidiary of wachovia corporation  under an agreement that expires in june upon termination or expiration of the lease  we must either purchase the property from the lessor for or arrange to have the office complex sold to a third party 
if the office complex is sold to a third party for an amount less than the  the amount paid by the lessor for the purchase of the complex from an unrelated third party  we have agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor up to if the office complex is sold to a third party for an amount in excess of  convergys is entitled to collect the excess 
at the inception of the lease  we recognized a liability of approximately for the related residual value guarantee 
the value of the guarantee was determined by computing the estimated present value of probability weighted cash flows that might be expended under the guarantee 
we have recorded a liability for the fair value of the obligation with a corresponding asset recorded as prepaid rent  which is being amortized to rental expense over the lease term 
the liability will remain on the balance sheet until the end of the lease term 
under the terms of the lease  we also provide certain indemnities to the lessor  including environmental indemnities 
due to the nature of such potential obligations  it is not possible to estimate the maximum amount of such exposure or the fair value 
we do not expect such amounts  if any  to be material 
we have concluded that we are not required to consolidate the lessor pursuant to financial accounting standards board financial interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
we believe that our present ability to borrow is greater than our established credit facilities in place 
if market conditions change and we experience a significant decline in revenues or increase in costs  our cash flows and liquidity could be reduced 
this could cause rating agencies to lower our credit ratings  thereby increasing our borrowing costs  or even causing a reduction in or elimination of our access to debt and ability to raise additional equity 
during  we fully utilized the previous share purchase authorizations 
on august   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional million of our common shares 
we repurchased million common shares for during and through december   we repurchased million shares of convergys common stock for pursuant to all authorizations 
we may continue to execute share repurchases from time to time as determined by management 
the timing and terms of the transactions depend on a number of considerations including market conditions and our liquidity 
at december   we have authority to purchase an additional million common shares pursuant to the current authorization 
from january  to february   we purchased million shares of convergys stock pursuant to these authorizations

at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of related to performance and payment guarantees  of which is set to expire by the end of  is set to expire within to years and is set to expire after years 
we do not believe that any obligation that may arise will be material 
market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our risk management strategy includes the use of derivative instruments to reduce the effects on our operating results and cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in currency exchange and interest rates 
in using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in exchange rates and interest rates  we expose ourselves to counterparty credit risk 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk by entering into derivative financial instruments with highly rated institutions that can be expected to perform fully under the terms of the agreements and by diversifying the number of financial institutions with which we enter into such agreements 
interest rate risk at december   we had in outstanding variable rate borrowings 
the carrying amount of our borrowings reflects fair value due to their short term and variable interest rate features 
we sometimes use interest rate swaps to hedge our interest rate exposure 
these instruments are hedges of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
these contracts are entered into to protect against the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from such transactions will be adversely affected by changes in interest rates 
there were no outstanding interest rate swaps covering interest rate exposure at december  based upon our exposure to variable rate borrowings  a one percentage point change in the weighted average interest rate would change our annual interest expense by less than foreign currency exchange rate risk our company serves many of our us based clients using contact center capacity in canada  india and the philippines 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred to render services under these contracts are denominated in canadian dollars cad  philippine peso php or indian rupees inr  which represents a foreign exchange exposure 
we have hedged a portion of our exposure related to the anticipated cash flow requirements denominated in these foreign currencies by entering into forward contracts with several financial institutions to acquire a total of cad at a fixed price of through november  php  at a fixed price of through december and inr  at a fixed price of through december additionally  we had entered into option contracts to purchase approximately cad for a fixed price of through july the fair value of these derivative instruments as of december  is presented in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the potential loss in fair value at december  for such contracts resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in all foreign currency exchange rates is approximately this loss would be mitigated by corresponding gains on the underlying exposures 
other foreign currency exposures arise from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency and foreign denominated revenue and profit convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued translated into us dollars 
we periodically enter into forward exchange contracts that are not designated as hedges 
the purpose of these derivative instruments is to protect the company against foreign currency exposure pertaining to receivables and payables that are denominated in currencies different from the functional currencies of the company or the respective subsidiaries 
as of december   the fair value of these derivatives was in  we entered into treasury lock derivative instruments for in anticipation of a probable debt issuance later in the treasury locks enable us to lock in a treasury yield so that we are no longer exposed to treasury yield movements  which would impact our cost of funds 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments in these areas based on historical experience and other relevant factors 
our estimates as of the date of the financial statements reflect our best judgment giving consideration to all currently available facts and circumstances 
as such  these estimates may require adjustment in the future  as additional facts become known or as circumstances change 
we have identified below the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical in compiling our statements of financial condition and operating results 
we have reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
goodwill at december   we had goodwill with a net carrying value of as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we are required to test goodwill for impairment annually and at other times if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate the carrying value of goodwill may no longer be recoverable 
the impairment test for goodwill involves a two step process 
the first step compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  the second step requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill will be recorded as an impairment loss 
fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a combination of the market approach and the income approach 
under the market approach  fair value is based on actual stock price or transaction prices of comparable companies 
the market approach requires significant judgment regarding the selection of comparable companies 
under the income approach  value is dependent on the present value of net cash flows to be derived from the ownership 
the income approach requires significant judgment including estimates about future cash flows and discount rates 
as required  during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual impairment tests for our reporting units information management international  information management north america  customer management and hr management 
based on the results of the first step  we had no goodwill impairment related to our four reporting units 
we believe we make every reasonable effort to ensure that we accurately estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
however  future changes in the assumptions used to make these estimates could result in the recording of an impairment loss

table of contents deferred charges in connection with our information management data processing and hr management outsourcing arrangements  we often perform a significant amount of set up activities or implementations  which include the installation and customization of our proprietary software in our centers 
under these arrangements  clients do not take possession of the software nor have the right to take possession of the software without incurring a significant penalty 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  the implementations are not treated as separate elements for revenue recognition purposes 
any proceeds collected for the implementations are deferred and recognized over the service period 
additionally  with respect to certain multiple element arrangements  we defer all revenue related to the contracts until the final element is delivered 
we capitalize all direct and incremental implementation and multiple element costs  to the extent recovery is probable  and amortize them ratably over the life of the arrangements as costs of providing service 
at inception and throughout the term of the contract  we evaluate recoverability by considering profits to be earned during the term of the contract  the creditworthiness of the client and  if applicable  contract termination penalties payable by the client in the event that the client terminates the contract early 
our estimate of profitability is dependent in large part on our estimate of costs 
although we make every reasonable effort to accurately estimate costs  revisions may be made based on actual costs incurred that could result in the recording of an impairment loss 
additionally  if the financial condition of a client were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments  we may be unable to recover the costs  which would result in an impairment loss 
finally  our entitlement to termination fees may be subject to challenge if a client were to allege that we were in breach of contract 
however  based on our evaluation of the related contracts  we believe that the of deferred charges is recoverable 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are discussed in detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
a portion of our revenues is derived from transactions that require a significant level of judgment 
this includes percentage of completion we recognize some software license and related professional and consulting revenues using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs at completion 
during  approximately of our consolidated revenues were recognized using the percentage of completion method 
this method of accounting relies on estimates of total expected contract revenues and costs 
this method is used because reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
because the financial reporting of these contracts depends on estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of the contracts  recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contracts progress to completion 
revisions in estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in the reversal of previously recognized revenues 
when estimates indicate a loss under a contract  a provision for such loss is recorded as a component of costs of providing services 
as work progresses under a loss contract  revenues continue to be recognized  and a portion of the contract loss incurred in each period is charged to the contract loss reserve 
license arrangements approximately of our consolidated revenues were derived from license and support and maintenance arrangements 
the accounting for these arrangements can be complex and requires a significant amount of judgment 
some of the factors that we must assess include the separate elements of the arrangement  vendor specific objective evidence of convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued fair value for the various undelivered elements of the arrangement  whether the software fees are fixed or determinable  whether the fees are considered collectible and whether services included in the arrangement represent significant production  customization or modification of the software 
multiple element outsourcing arrangements hr management  which accounted for of our consolidated revenues in  delivers multiple services under our client arrangements eg  benefits administration  recruiting  payroll and learning 
in connection with these arrangements  we must assess these multiple element arrangements to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  establishes the following criteria  all of which must be met  in order for a deliverable to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered items have value to the client on a stand alone basis 
there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
if these criteria are met  each of the contractual services included in the contract is treated as a separate unit of accounting and revenue is recognized as we deliver each of the contractual services 
if these criteria are not met  all of the services included are accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
revenue is then recognized either using a proportional performance method such as recognizing revenue based on transactional services delivered or on a straight line basis once hr management begins to deliver the final service 
the assessments of these areas require us to make a significant amount of judgments 
the judgments made in these areas could have a significant effect on revenues recognized in any period by changing the amount and or the timing of the revenue recognized 
we believe that we make a reasonable effort to ensure accuracy in our judgment and estimates 
contingencies the company is from time to time subject to claims and administrative proceedings that are filed in the ordinary course of business 
we believe that the results of any such claims or administrative proceedings  either individually or in the aggregate  will not have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  the outcome of any litigation cannot be predicted with certainty 
an unfavorable resolution of one or more pending matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements in the future 
restructuring accrual during the last four years  we have recorded significant restructuring charges related to reductions in headcount and facility closures 
as of december   we had a restructuring accrual of  of which relates to facility closure costs  which will be paid over several years until the leases expire 
the accrual is equal to the future costs associated with those abandoned facilities  net of the proceeds from any probable future sublease agreements 
we have used estimates  based on consultation with real estate advisors  to arrive at the proceeds from any future sublease agreements 
we will continue to evaluate our estimates in recording the facilities abandonment charge 
as a result  there may be additional charges or reversals in the future 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the enacted tax rates expected to apply in the periods in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be settled or realized 
convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is made on a jurisdictional basis and is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence 
this evidence includes historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax planning strategies 
projected future taxable income is based on expected results and assumptions as to the jurisdiction in which the income will be earned 
the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences is based on current tax law and the company s tax methods of accounting 
the company also reviews its tax activities and records a liability for its uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb no 
the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount  which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company s policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits as part of income tax expense 
significant judgment is required in determining our liability for uncertain tax positions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be significantly different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
we believe that we make a reasonable effort to ensure accuracy in our judgment and estimates 
other we have made certain other estimates that  while not involving the same degree of judgment  are important to understanding our financial statements 
these estimates are in the areas of measuring our obligations related to our defined benefit plans  self insurance accruals and assessing recoverability of intangible assets

table of contents risks relating to convergys and its business client consolidations could result in a loss of clients and adversely affect our operating results 
we serve clients in industries that have experienced a significant level of consolidation 
we cannot assure that additional consolidations will not occur in which our clients acquire additional businesses or are acquired 
such consolidations may result in the termination of an existing client contract  which could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
in september  sprint pcs  a large information management data processing outsourcing client  completed its acquisition of nextel communications 
in  the client informed us that it intended to consolidate its billing systems onto a competitor s system 
their current plan is to complete migrating most of their subscribers from our billing system during the migration began in we are supporting sprint nextel with its migration efforts 
if the migration proceeds as planned  it will negatively impact information management s revenues and operating results 
in december  at t and bell south merged 
the company has long standing relationships with both at t and bell south 
prior to the merger  cingular a joint venture between at t and bell south was our largest client in terms of revenue 
beginning in  we have assisted at t with its strategy to migrate subscribers off of the at t wireless billing systems which we supported onto at t s two systems  one of which we support 
the migration was completed earlier this year and has negatively impacted information management revenues and operating results 
in january  at t informed us that it intends to migrate its subscribers from the system that we currently support through a managed services agreement onto at t s other system over the next two years 
once this migration is complete  we expect at t to continue to remain an important client 
a large portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of clients  and the loss of one or more of our clients could cause a reduction in our revenues and earnings 
we rely on several clients for a large percentage of our revenues 
our three largest clients  at t  sprint nextel and comcast  collectively represented of our revenues 
our relationship with at t is represented by separate contracts work orders with information management  customer management and hr management 
our relationship with sprint nextel is represented by separate information management and customer management contracts 
since february  we have provided customer management services to sprint nextel under a contract between sprint nextel and ibm  whereby we serve as a subcontractor to ibm 
we serve comcast under customer management and information management contracts 
as a result  we do not believe that it is likely that our entire relationship with at t  sprint nextel or comcast would terminate at one time  and  therefore  we are not substantially dependent on any particular contract work order with these clients 
however  the loss of all of the contracts work orders with a particular client at the same time or the loss of one or more of the larger contracts work orders with a client would adversely affect our total revenues if the revenues from such client were not replaced with revenues from that client or other clients 
a large portion of our accounts receivable are payable by a limited number of clients and the inability of any of these clients to pay its accounts receivable could cause a reduction in our revenues and earnings 
several significant clients account for a large percentage of our accounts receivable 
as of december   our three largest clients  at t  sprint nextel and comcast  collectively accounted for of our accounts receivable 
during the past three years  each of these clients has generally paid its accounts receivable on a timely basis  and write downs that we have incurred in connection with such accounts receivable were consistent with write downs that we incurred with other clients 
we anticipate that several clients will continue to account for a large convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued percentage of our accounts receivable 
although we currently do not expect payment issues with any of these clients  if any of them were unable or unwilling  for any reason  to pay our accounts receivable  our income would decrease 
we also carry significant receivable balances with other clients whose declaration of bankruptcy could decrease our income 
if our clients are not successful  the amount of business that they outsource and the prices that they are willing to pay for such services may diminish and could result in a reduction of our revenues and earnings 
our revenues depend on the success of our clients 
if our clients or their specific programs are not successful  the amount of business that they outsource may be diminished 
thus  although we have signed contracts  many of which contain minimum revenue commitments  to provide services to our clients  there can be no assurance that the level of revenues generated by such contracts will meet expectations 
in addition  several clients  particularly in the communications and technology industries  have experienced substantial price competition 
we may continue to face price pressure from such clients  which could negatively affect our operating results 
we process  transmit and store personally identifiable information  and unauthorized access to or the unintended release of this information could result in a claim for damage or loss of business and create unfavorable publicity 
we process  transmit and store personally identifiable information  both in our role as a service provider and as an employer 
this information may include social security numbers  financial and health information  as well as other personal information 
as a result  we are subject to certain contractual terms  as well as federal  state and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect personally identifiable information 
we take measures to protect against unauthorized access and to comply with these laws and regulations 
unauthorized access or failure to comply with these laws and regulations may subject us to contractual liability and damages  loss of business  damages from individual claimants  fines  penalties  criminal prosecution and unfavorable publicity  any of which could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
the global scope  size and complexity of implementations in our hr management business could cause delays and cost overruns in those projects  which could adversely affect revenues and profits 
we have won several long term  human resource outsourcing contracts with global clients 
these contracts are complex as they involve providing multiple services such as payroll  recruiting  benefits administration  learning  compensation and human resources administration  across many countries 
implementations of the contracts can take more than two years to complete 
due to the complexity of the implementations and changes in customer requirements ie  an acquisition by a customer during the implementation  implementation cost overruns and delays are possible 
cost overruns can result in additional expense during the implementation period and over the life of the contract  which would likely affect the profitability of the contract 
given the size of some of these contracts  the impact from these cost overruns or schedule delays can have a significant impact on our revenues and profits 
delays in completing the implementations can cause us to recognize revenue and profit from the contracts later than we anticipated when the initial contract was signed 
our ability to deliver our services is at risk if the technology and network equipment that we rely upon is not maintained or upgraded in a timely manner 
technology is a critical foundation in our service delivery 
we utilize and deploy internally developed and third party software solutions across various hardware environments 
we operate an extensive internal communications network that links our global sites together in a multi hub model that enables the rerouting of data and voice traffic 
also  we rely on multiple public communication channels for connectivity to our clients 
maintenance of and investment in these foundational components are critical to our success 
if the reliability of technology or network operations fall below required service levels  or a systemic fault convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents affects the organization broadly  business from our existing and potential clients may be jeopardized and cause our revenue to decrease 
emergency interruption of data centers and customer management and hr management contact centers could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in the event that we experience a temporary or permanent interruption at one or more of our data or contact centers  through casualty  operating malfunction or other causes  we may be unable to provide the data processing  customer management and hr management services we are contractually obligated to deliver 
this could result in us being required to pay contractual damages to some clients or to allow some clients to terminate or renegotiate their contracts 
notwithstanding contingency plans and precautions instituted to protect our clients and us from events that could interrupt delivery of services including property and business interruption insurance that we maintain  there is no guarantee that such interruptions would not result in a prolonged interruption in our ability to provide support services to our clients or that such precautions would adequately compensate us for any losses we may incur as a result of such interruptions 
defects or errors within our software could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
design defects or software errors may delay software introductions or reduce the satisfaction level of clients and may have a materially adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our billing software is highly complex and may  from time to time  contain design defects or software errors that may be difficult to detect and or correct 
since both our clients and we use our billing software to perform critical business functions  design defects  software errors or other potential problems within or outside of our control may arise from the use of our software 
it may also result in financial or other damages to our clients  for which we may be held responsible 
although our license agreements with our clients may often contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential claims and liabilities arising from client problems  these provisions may not effectively protect us against such claims in all cases and in all jurisdictions 
claims and liabilities arising from client problems could result in monetary damages to us and could cause damage to our reputation  adversely affecting our business and results of operations 
if the global trend toward outsourcing does not continue  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
revenue growth depends  in large part  on the trend toward outsourcing  particularly as it relates to our customer management and hr management outsourcing operations 
outsourcing involves companies contracting with a third party  such as convergys  to provide customer management and hr management services rather than performing such services in house 
there can be no assurance that this trend will continue  as organizations may elect to perform such services in house 
a significant change in this trend could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
a longer sales cycle could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
during the past few years  we have focused on transforming the hr management segment into a leading provider in the growing human resource outsourcing market 
although we won long term global human resource outsourcing arrangements with several clients  the sales cycles for large global human resource outsourcing arrangements have ranged from to months 
the sales cycle is long due to complexities associated with outsourcing human resource functions  including decisions regarding what functions to outsource  locations and timing of outsourcing 
this longer sales cycle can result in delays in the execution of the contracts  increase selling costs and negatively impact our revenues and operating results 
convergys corporation annual report 
table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued if we are unable to identify and complete appropriate acquisitions  we may not be able to achieve historical growth rates 
our growth since inception of the business has been enhanced through acquisitions of other businesses including their service offerings and licenses 
we continue to pursue strategic acquisitions 
if we are unable to make appropriate acquisitions on reasonable terms  whether for cash  convergys securities or both  it may be difficult for us to achieve the same level of growth as achieved historically 
we are susceptible to business and political risks from domestic and international operations that could result in reduced revenues or earnings 
we operate a global business and have facilities located throughout north and south america  europe  the middle east and the asian pacific region 
as part of our strategy  we plan to capture more of the international billing  customer management and hr management markets 
additionally  north american companies require offshore customer management outsourcing capacity 
as a result  we expect to continue expansion through start up operations and acquisitions in foreign countries 
expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional countries will require management attention and financial resources 
in addition  there are certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally including exposure to currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in complying with a variety of foreign laws  changes in legal or regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability and potentially adverse tax consequences 
to the extent that we are adversely affected by these risks  our business could be adversely affected and our revenues and or earnings could be reduced 
in addition  there has been political discussion and debate related to worldwide competitive sourcing  particularly from the united states to offshore locations 
federal and state legislation has been proposed that relates to this issue 
future legislation  if enacted  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our earnings are affected by changes in foreign currency 
customer management serves an increasing number of its us based customer management clients using contact center capacity in canada  india and the philippines 
although the contracts with these clients are typically priced in us dollars  a substantial portion of the costs incurred by customer management to render services under these contracts is denominated in canadian dollars  indian rupees or philippine pesos  which represents a foreign exchange exposure to the company 
we enter into forward exchange contracts and options to limit potential foreign currency exposure 
as the us dollar weakened during and  the operating expenses of these contact centers  once translated into us dollars  increased 
the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by gains realized through the settlement of the hedged instruments 
however  if the us dollar weakens further  our earnings will continue to be negatively impacted 
if we do not effectively manage our capacity  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our ability to profit from the global trend toward outsourcing depends largely on how effectively we manage our customer management and hr management contact center capacity 
in order to create the additional capacity necessary to accommodate new or expanded outsourcing projects  we must open new contact centers 
the opening or expansion of a contact center may result  at least in the short term  in idle capacity until we fully implement the new or expanded program 
we periodically assess the expected long term capacity utilization of our contact centers 
as a result  we may  if deemed necessary  consolidate  close or partially close under performing contact centers to maintain or improve targeted utilization and margins 
there can be no guarantee that we will be able to achieve or maintain optimal utilization of our contact center capacity

and as part of our effort to consolidate our facilities  we seek to sublease a portion of our surplus space  if any  and recover certain costs associated with it 
to the extent that we fail to sublease such surplus space  our expenses will increase 
if we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel in certain areas of our business  our ability to execute our business plans in those areas could be impaired and revenues could decrease 
we employ approximately  employees worldwide 
at times  we have experienced difficulties in hiring personnel with the desired levels of training or experience 
staffing personnel with appropriate technical expertise is particularly critical in connection with the recent contracts signed by hr management 
additionally  in regard to the labor intensive business of customer management  quality service depends on our ability to control personnel turnover 
any increase in the employee turnover rate could increase recruiting and training costs and could decrease operating effectiveness and productivity 
we may not be able to continue to hire  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel to adequately staff new client projects 
because a significant portion of our operating costs relates to labor costs  an increase in wages  costs of employee benefits or employment taxes could have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
continued war and terrorist attacks or other civil disturbances could lead to economic weakness and could disrupt our operations resulting in a decrease of our revenues and earnings 
war and terrorist attacks have caused uncertainty in the global financial markets and in the united states economy 
the war in iraq and any additional terrorist attacks may lead to continued armed hostilities or further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the united states or elsewhere  which may contribute to economic instability in the united states and disrupt our operations in the us and abroad 
such disruptions could cause service interruptions or reduce the quality level of the services that we provide  resulting in a reduction of our revenues 
these activities may also cause our clients to delay or defer decisions regarding their use of our services and  thus  delay receipt of additional revenues 
in addition  war and terrorist attacks in other regions could disrupt our operations and or create economic uncertainty with our clients  which could cause a reduction in revenues and earnings 
a significant or prolonged economic downturn could have a materially adverse effect on our revenues and profit margin 
our results of operations are affected directly by the level of business activity of our clients  which in turn are affected by the level of economic activity in the industries and markets that they serve 
economic slowdowns in some markets  particularly in the united states  may cause reductions in technology and discretionary spending by our clients  which may result in reductions in the growth of new business as well as reductions in existing business 
if our clients enter bankruptcy or liquidate their operations  our revenues could be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that weakening economic conditions throughout the world will not adversely impact our results of operations and or financial position 
reduced demand for our services could increase price competition
