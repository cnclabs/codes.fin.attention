we manufacture substantially all of these items in our hayward  california and charlotte  north carolina manufacturing facilities

additionally  we sell a variety of photo based merchandise that is currently manufactured for us by third parties  such as mugs  mouse pads  coasters  tote bags  desk organizers  puzzles  playing cards  multi media dvds  magnets and keepsake boxes  and ancillary products  such as frames  photo albums and scrapbooking accessories 
our high quality products and services and the compelling online experience we create for our customers  together with our focus on continuous innovation  have earned us numerous third party accolades and  more importantly  have allowed us to establish a premium brand 
we believe that we realize the benefits of a premium brand through high customer loyalty  low customer acquisition costs and premium pricing

in addition to driving lower customer acquisition costs through viral marketing  our customers provide input on new features  functionalities and products 
close  frequent customer interactions  coupled with significant investments in sophisticated integrated marketing programs  enable us to fine tune and tailor our promotions and website presentation to specific customer segments 
consequently  customers are presented with a highly personalized shutterfly shopping experience  which helps foster a unique and deep relationship with our brand 
our corporation was formed in and we have experienced rapid growth since launching our service in december during fiscal year  we fulfilled more than seven million orders  to more than two million customers  at an average order value of more than per order

on january   for million in cash and stock consideration of approximately million  we acquired nexo systems  a privately held on line sharing and group services company based in palo alto  california 
basis of presentation net revenues 
we generate revenues primarily from the printing and shipping of photo based products  such as photo books  cards and calendars  photo prints  photo based merchandise  such as mugs  mouse pads and magnets  and ancillary products such as frames  photo albums and scrapbooking accessories 
revenues are recorded net of estimated returns  promotions redeemed by customers and other discounts 
customers place orders via our website and pay primarily using credit cards 
our personalized products and services revenues are derived from the sale of photo based products  photo based merchandise and ancillary products and services  and the related shipping revenues 
referral fees are also included in personalized products and services revenue 
we believe our products and services are differentiated from other traditional photo processors by our high quality production and numerous form factors and templates  which are key to attracting and retaining customers 
our print revenues are derived from sales of our photo processing of digital images  including sales of prints  and the related shipping revenues 
from time to time  we have made changes to our pricing structure for prints in order to remain competitive 
in december   one of our competitors lowered their list prices on prints from to 
to date  we have not made any additional changes to the price of our prints as a result of this price cut 
however  a drop in our prices  without a corresponding increase in volume  or decreases in volume as a result of competitive pressures would negatively impact our net revenues and could adversely affect our gross margins and overall profitability 
to offset these periodic price declines and continue to generate net income  we have continued to invest in large scale manufacturing technology to enable us to reduce the cost of manufacturing prints 
we have also continued to recruit highly qualified personnel with specialized skills in print manufacturing 
we believe that these strategies have allowed us  and will continue to allow us  to compete successfully with other companies in our industry 
in addition  we continue to focus on diversifying our business towards the large and growing market for personalized products and services 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
in particular  we generate a substantial portion of our revenues during the holiday season in the calendar fourth quarter 
we also typically experience increases in net revenues during other shopping related seasonal events  such as easter  mother s day  father s day  and halloween 
we generally experience lower net revenues during the first  second and third calendar quarters and  as is typical in the retail industry  have incurred and may continue to incur losses in these quarters 
due to the relatively short lead time required to fulfill product orders  usually one to three business days  order backlog is not material to our business 
to further understand net revenue trends  we monitor several key metrics including total customers 
we closely monitor total customers as a key indicator of demand 
total customers include the number of transacting customers in a given period 
we seek to expand our customer base by empowering our existing customers with sharing and collaboration services such as shutterfly gallery  the nexo platform  and shutterfly collections  and by conducting integrated marketing and advertising programs 
total customers have increased on an annual basis for each year since inception  and we anticipate that this trend will continue 
average order value 
average order value is net revenues for a given period divided by the total number of customer orders recorded during that same period 
we seek to increase average order value as a means of increasing net revenues 
average order value has increased on an annual basis for each year since  and we anticipate that this trend will continue in the future 
total number of orders 
we closely monitor total number of orders as a leading indicator of net revenue trends 
we recognize the net revenues associated with an order when the products have been shipped and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
orders are typically processed and shipped within two business days after a customer places an order 
total number of orders has increased on an annual basis for each year since  and we anticipate that this trend will continue in the future 
personalized products and services revenues as percentage of net revenues 
we continue to innovate and improve our personalized products and services and expect the net revenues from these products and services to increase as percentage of net revenues as we continue to diversify our product offerings 
personalized products and services as a percentage of total net revenue increased from in to in in addition  as a percentage of total net revenues  revenues from x prints have been declining  from in  to in  and to in we believe the analysis of these metrics and others provides us with important information on our overall net revenue trends and operating results 
fluctuations in these metrics are not unusual and no single factor is determinative of our net revenues and operating results 
cost of net revenues 
cost of net revenues consist primarily of direct materials the majority of which consists of paper  ink  and photo book covers  payroll and related expenses for direct labor  shipping charges  packaging supplies  distribution and fulfillment activities  rent for production facilities  depreciation of production equipment  and third party costs for photo based merchandise 
cost of net revenues also includes payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in customer service 
in addition  cost of revenues includes any third party software or patents licensed  as well as the amortization of acquired developed technology and capitalized website development costs 
operating expenses 
operating expenses consist of technology and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses 
we anticipate that each of the following categories of operating expenses will increase in absolute dollar amounts  but remain relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenues 
technology and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs for employees and contractors engaged in the development and ongoing maintenance of our website  infrastructure and software 
these expenses include depreciation of the computer and network hardware used to run our website and store the customer data  as well as amortization of purchased software 
technology and development expense also includes colocation and bandwidth costs 
sales and marketing expense consists of costs incurred for marketing programs and personnel and related expenses for our customer acquisition  product marketing  business development and public relations activities 
our marketing efforts consist of various online and offline media programs  such as e mail and direct mail promotions  the purchase of keyword search terms and various strategic alliances 
we depend on these efforts to attract customers to our service 
general and administrative expense includes general corporate costs  including rent for our corporate offices  insurance  depreciation on information technology equipment and legal and accounting fees 
in addition  general and administrative expense includes personnel expenses of employees involved in executive  finance  accounting  human resources  information technology and legal roles 
third party payment processor and credit card fees are also included in general and administrative expense and have historically fluctuated based on revenues during the period 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of interest costs recognized under our capital lease obligations and other borrowings 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net consists primarily of the interest income on our cash and investment accounts and the net income expense related to changes in the fair value of convertible preferred stock warrants 
subsequent to the completion of our initial public offering on october   all of our warrants to purchase shares of preferred stock converted into warrants to purchase shares of common stock 
accordingly  the liability for the convertible preferred stock warrants was reclassified as common stock and additional paid in capital and the warrants are no longer subject to re measurement 
income taxes 
historically  we have only been subject to taxation in the united states because we have sold almost all of our products to customers in the united states 
if we continue to sell our products primarily to customers located within the united states  we anticipate that our long term future effective tax rate will range between and critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances  changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are the most critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition 
we generate revenues primarily from the printing and shipping of prints and other photo based products  and referral fees 
we generally recognize revenues from product sales upon shipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists typically through the use of a credit card or receipt of a check  the selling price is fixed or determinable and collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
revenues from amounts billed to customers  including prepaid orders  are deferred until shipment of fulfilled orders 
we provide our customers with a satisfaction guarantee whereby products can be returned within a day period for a reprint or refund 
we maintain an allowance for estimated future returns based on historical data 
during the year ended december   returns totaled less than of net revenues and have been within management s expectations 
we periodically provide incentive offers to our customers in exchange for setting up an account and to encourage purchases 
such offers include free products and percentage discounts on current purchases 
discounts  when accepted by customers  are treated as a reduction to the purchase price of the related transaction and are included in net revenues 
production costs related to free products are included in costs of revenues upon redemption 
shipping charged to customers is recognized as revenue at the time of shipment 
revenue from referral fees for click throughs is recognized in the period that the click through impression is delivered 
inventories 
our inventories consist primarily of paper  photo book covers and packaging supplies and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or net realizable value 
the value of inventories is reduced by an estimate for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimate for excess and obsolete inventories is based upon management s review of utilization of inventories in light of projected sales  current market conditions and market trends 
software and website development costs 
we capitalize eligible costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with the aicpa statement of position no 
and eitf issue no 
accordingly  payroll and payroll related costs incurred in the development phase are capitalized and amortized over the product s estimated useful life  which is generally three years 
costs associated with minor enhancements and maintenance for our website are expensed as incurred 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized by applying the statutory tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences between the financial reporting and tax filing bases of existing assets and liabilities are expected to reverse 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we believe that all net deferred tax assets shown on our balance sheet are more likely than not to be realized in the future and no valuation allowance is necessary 
in the event that actual results differ from those estimates or we adjust those estimates in future periods  we may need to record a valuation allowance  which will impact deferred tax assets and the results of operations in the period the change in made 
stock based compensation expense 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the prospective transition method  which requires us to apply the provisions of sfas no 
r only to new awards granted  and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled  after the effective date 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense recognized beginning january  is based on the following a the grant date fair value of stock option awards granted or modified after january   and b the balance of deferred stock based compensation related to stock option awards granted prior to january   which was calculated using the intrinsic value method as previously permitted under apb opinion no 
under sfas no r  we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes valuation model 
this model requires us to make estimates and assumptions including  among other things  estimates regarding the length of time an employee will retain vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to vesting 
the fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in our consolidated statements of operations 
results of operations the following table presents the components of our income statement as a percent of net revenues year ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses technology and development sales and marketing general and administrative income from operations interest expense other income  net income before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net income comparison of the years ended december  and year ended december  change change in thousands net revenues cost of net revenues percentage of net revenues gross profit net revenues increased million  or  from to revenue growth was attributable to the increases in both print and personalized products and services revenues

other factors  such as the volume of disqualifying dispositions also contributed to the reduction in our tax rate  year over year

as a result of our initial public offering in september  we raised approximately million of proceeds  net of underwriters discount  which we received on october  at december  we had million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
cash equivalents are compromised of money market funds and commercial paper 
short term investments is comprised of us government agency securities 
at february   million of our marketable securities portfolio was invested in aaa rated investments in auction rate debt securities 
auction rate securities are long term variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates 
after the initial issuance of the securities  the interest rate on the securities is reset periodically  at intervals established at the time of issuance primarily every twenty eight days  based on market demand for a reset period 
auction rate securities are bought and sold in the marketplace through a competitive bidding process often referred to as a dutch auction 
if there is insufficient interest in the securities at the time of an auction  the auction may not be completed and the rates may be reset to predetermined penalty or maximum rates 
following such a failed auction  we would not be able to access our funds that are invested in the corresponding auction rate securities until a future auction of these investments is successful or new buyers express interest in purchasing these securities in between reset dates 
as a result of the current negative liquidity conditions in the global credit markets  in february  auctions for million of original par value of our auction rate securities failed  rendering these securities temporarily illiquid through the normal auction process 
at the time of our initial investment and through the date of this report  all of our auction rate securities remain aaa rated 
the assets underlying each security are student loans and of the principal amounts are guaranteed by the federal family education loan program ffelp 
since we cannot predict when future auctions related to million of our auction rate securities will be successful  it may become necessary to classify this amount as long term marketable securities in our consolidated balance sheet in future periods 
in addition  if the underlying issuers are unable to successfully clear future auctions or if their credit rating deteriorates and the deterioration is deemed to be other than temporary  we would be required to adjust the carrying value of the auction rate securities through an impairment charge to earnings 
any of these events could materially affect our results of operations and our financial condition 
to access these funds in future periods  it may be necessary to attempt to sell these securities at an amount below our original purchase value 
however  based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents and our other liquid investments  totaling million at february   and our expected operating cash flows  we believe that we currently have adequate working capital resources to fund our operations for at least the next months 
the adequacy of these resources to meeting our liquidity needs beyond the next months will depend on our growth  operating results  the capital expenditures required to meet possible increased demand for our products  and the resolution of the auction rate securities auction failures 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business internally or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses at any time in the future  we may seek to sell additional equity or enter into working capital financing arrangements 
the sale of additional equity could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
financing arrangements may not be available to us  or may not be in amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
our industry is competitive and has endured periods of intense price competition 
because we plan to finance our operations and capital expenses largely through our operations  and because our results of operations are sensitive to the level of competition we face  increased competition could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
increased competition could do so both by reducing our net revenues and net income  as a result of reduced sales  reduced prices and increased promotional activities  among other factors  as well as by requiring us to spend cash on advertising and marketing in an effort to maintain or increase market share in the face of such competition 
in addition  we intend to increase many of our expenses  including some capital expenses  in advance of anticipated higher future revenues 
however  such increased expenses  while intended to support anticipated increases in future revenues  must be funded from current capital resources or from borrowings or equity financings 
as a result  our ability to grow our business relying largely on funds from our operations is sensitive to competitive pressures and other risks relating to our liquidity or capital resources 
we anticipate capital expenditures of between million to million for these expenditures will be used to purchase machinery and equipment to support the growth in our business and to increase our production capacity and help enable us to respond more quickly and efficiently to customer demand 
this range of capital expenditures  while significant  is not outside the ordinary course of our business or materially different from how we have expanded our business in the past 
we believe that such capital expenditures will have a positive effect on our results of operations if demand increases in line with increases in our production capacity 
however  these capital expenditures will have a negative effect on our results of operations if demand does not increase as we expect  and will have a negative effect on our results of operations in the short term if demand does not increase simultaneously  as we expect  with the capital expenditures spent to support increased demand 
operating activities

we do not expect to make additional donations to silicon valley community foundation in the foreseeable future 
in  net cash provided from operating activities of million resulted from net income of million that was adjusted for million of depreciation and amortization  million of income tax benefit and million of non cash amortization of stock based compensation 
in addition  net cash from operating activities increased due to a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities due to seasonally high balances at december  related to increased purchasing for the fourth quarter holiday season
