executive overview regent is focused on acquiring and operating radio stations in mid sized markets where the majority of every revenue dollar is locally generated 
we currently own and operate radio stations in broadcast markets 
regent stations hold the number one or two revenue positions in of our markets 
additionally  according to broadcast analysts  we are among the radio companies which have a highly concentrated average market share 
regent has out performed the industry  as reported by the radio advertising bureau  in same station net revenue growth for the past out of quarters 
on february   we disposed of four stations in watertown  new york for approximately million in cash 
the watertown transaction represents a continuation of our strategy to operate in broadcast markets ranked in size from to and follows the similar disposition of our chico and redding  california radio stations in late additionally during the first quarter of  we completed two transactions involving the disposition of non strategic assets the sale of wtmm am in albany  new york  and the sale of weck am in buffalo  new york 
the sale of these assets represent a continuation of our strategy to dispose of individual radio stations with weaker broadcast signals  as we have in the past with the sales of wyng fm in evansville  indiana  wgna am in albany  new york  and wrun am in utica  new york 
as a result of lower long term interest rates at the end of the year  we recorded an unrealized loss of approximately million related to the interest rate swap agreements we have in place on the term loan portions of our credit agreement 
this unrealized loss was partially offset by a realized gain of approximately million in related to favorable short term interest rates compared to our fixed interest rates 
as a result of the annual impairment testing of our indefinite lived intangible assets  we recorded approximately million of non cash impairment expense in this charge is representative of the current market value of regent s common stock  which reflects increased risk associated with long term advertising growth rates 
in the third quarter of  we expended approximately  in activist defense costs primarily legal fees related to stockholder demands 
on september   we entered into an agreement with the parties to the demand which resulted in the expansion of regent s board of directors to seven directors and the appointment of two new directors to the board 
we have continued to develop our interactive initiative in  which focuses on generating revenues through our stations websites 
in the third quarter of  we hired a vice president of technology and digital media to lead our interactive efforts 
we have also hired interactive sales managers and interactive program directors in several of our larger markets 
while revenues and operating income from regent interactive was immaterial to the company in  we anticipate increased economic benefits in and beyond 
we began a consolidation capital expenditure project in the fourth quarter of related to a new operating facility for our evansville  indiana market 
we anticipate this project will cost approximately million 
we also anticipate the sale of our existing facility  which will offset a portion of the cost of the new facility 
we expect to see many benefits as a result of this project  including increased sales due to an expansion of our sales force and improved employee morale 
currently  and including the buffalo stations  we have fm stations and one am station broadcasting in digital  or high definition radio hd radio 
we expended approximately million in cash in to convert nine stations to digital radio and enable one secondary channel for each of two previously converted radio stations 
the conversion to hd radio will enable the stations to broadcast digital quality sound and also provide additional services  such as on demand traffic  weather and sports scores 
additionally  this new technology will enable each converted radio station to broadcast additional channels of programming for public  private or subscription services 
the economic benefit  if any  to our stations that have converted to hd radio currently cannot be measured 
any future economic benefit to our stations as a result of digital conversion is not known at this time 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our accounting estimates  the most significant of which include establishing allowances for doubtful accounts  allocating the purchase price of acquisitions  evaluating the realizability of our deferred tax assets  determining the recoverability of our long lived assets  and evaluating our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
the basis for our estimates are historical experience and various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  given the available information at the time of the estimate  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of commercial broadcast time to advertisers when the commercials are broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as pervasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets our fcc licenses qualify as indefinite lived intangible assets  and represent a significant portion of the assets on our balance sheet 
we utilize the greenfield methodology for valuation of our fcc licenses  which allocates a start up value to each station and employs a discounted cash flow methodology and accepted appraisal techniques 
to test goodwill  we utilize a market multiple approach at the reporting unit level 
local economic conditions in each of our markets could impact whether an fcc license or goodwill is impaired  as a decrease or increase in market revenue could negatively or positively impact discounted cash flows 
other factors such as interest rates  the performance of the s p  cash flow multiples as well as capital expenditures  can affect the discounted cash flow analysis 
in the event that there are no representative asset purchases or sale transactions to substantiate the fair value analysis utilized in the application of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we may defer to the fair value implied by regent s market capitalization to establish the fair value 
to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets  an impairment loss will be recorded in operating income or loss 
a decrease in expected cash flow with no further changes in assumptions  would result in approximately million of impairment expense 
allocation of acquisition purchase price and valuation of acquired intangible assets we believe the determination of the fair value of our acquired intangible assets is a critical accounting policy as their value is significant relative to our total assets 
we apply various common valuation methods to determine the value of tangible assets  fcc licenses  and other intangible assets 
the critical assumptions we use in the valuation of our intangible assets include assumptions about market growth  cash flow growth  multiples of cash flow  and other economic factors 
determining the recoverability of long lived assets our long lived assets to be held and used fixed assets and definite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset 
if we were to determine that the carrying amount of an asset was not recoverable  we would record an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset 
we determine the fair value of our long lived assets based upon the market value of similar assets  if available  or independent appraisals  if necessary 
long lived assets to be disposed of and or held for sale are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell 
we determine the fair value of these assets in the same manner as described for assets held and used 
deferred tax assets at december   we had current and non current deferred tax assets of approximately million before valuation allowance  the primary component of which is our net operating loss carryforwards 
while we have a valuation allowance of approximately million established for tax assets expiring through  we have determined that it is not necessary to record a valuation allowance against our net operating loss carryforwards that expire in years through  based on estimated future taxable income during those years 
our estimated future taxable income in those periods takes into consideration the anticipated future run off of significant tax amortization related to existing fcc licenses and tax deductible goodwill by however  there is no assurance that our projections will be achieved  and if our taxable income projections fall short  we most likely would need to record an additional valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that would not be utilized 
the need to record an additional valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets is reviewed quarterly  and if we were to determine that we would be unable to realize a portion  or the remainder of the deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be recorded as expense in the period such determination was made 
additionally  if it were determined that we would be able to utilize a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards that are currently reduced by a valuation allowance  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be recorded as a reduction to income tax expense 
if our provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate due to unfavorable law changes or unforeseen circumstances  we could experience expenses in excess of the current or deferred income tax provisions we have established 
a or less decrease in cumulative taxable income projections through our carryforward period would have no impact on our valuation allowance 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we routinely review customer account activity in order to assess the adequacy of the allowances provided for potential losses 
based on historical information  we believe that our allowance is adequate 
however  changes in general economic  business and market conditions could affect the ability of our customers to make their required payments  therefore  the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed monthly and changes to the allowance are updated as new information is received 
a one percent change to our allowance as a percent of our outstanding accounts receivable at december  would cause a change in net income of approximately million  net of tax

results of operations the key factors that have affected our business over the last three years are discussed and analyzed in the following paragraphs 
this commentary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related footnotes included herein 
our financial results are seasonal 
as is typical in the radio broadcasting industry  we expect our first calendar quarter to produce the lowest revenues for the year  and the fourth calendar quarter to produce the highest revenues for the year 
our operating results in any period may be affected by advertising and promotion expenses that do not necessarily produce commensurate revenues until the impact of the advertising and promotion is realized in future periods 
compared to results of continuing operations for the year ended december  compared to december  were impacted by several factors 
revenue comparisons were impacted by approximately million of political revenues that were recorded primarily in the third and fourth quarters of  compared to approximately million in the comparable period 
comparative results were also impacted in by the operations related to the buffalo cluster which we began operating october  net broadcast revenues the radio industry overall experienced a decrease in revenues in compared to  according to the radio advertising bureau rab 
the rab further indicated that in  local revenues decreased  national revenues decreased by and network revenues increased 
in  our net broadcast revenue was derived from approximately local revenue and national revenue 
net broadcast revenues for regent increased to approximately million in from approximately million in the table below provides a summary of the net broadcast revenue variance for the comparable twelve month periods in thousands net broadcast revenue variance increase decrease in net broadcast revenue change local revenue national revenue political revenue barter revenue other net broadcast revenue variance the increase in local advertising revenue in compared to was due primarily to increased local revenue as a result of the buffalo acquisition 
similarly  the favorable national advertising revenue variance was primarily due to the buffalo acquisition 
local revenue increased in all our markets with the exception of our flint and grand rapids  michigan and bloomington  illinois markets 
local revenue increased in our lafayette  louisiana and peoria  illinois markets by and  respectively 
national revenue increased in all our markets with the exception of our el paso  texas  grand rapids  michigan and utica  new york markets 
additionally  our buffalo market experienced a decrease of approximately million  or  in national revenue during the fourth quarter of  compared to the same period in station operating expenses station operating expenses increased  to approximately million in from approximately million in the table below provides a summary of the station operating expense variance for the comparable twelve month periods in thousands station operating expense variance increase in station operating expense change technical expense programming expense promotion expense interactive expense n m sales expense administrative expense barter expense station operating expense variance n m calculation is not meaningful as the company began its interactive initiative in a substantial portion of the million expense increase was due to the results of the buffalo stations  which we began operating at the beginning of the fourth quarter of technical expenses increased approximately due primarily to increased equipment repair  increases in heat  light and power costs  higher compensation expense  and increased rent expenses as a result of the buffalo stations 
programming expenses increased by approximately primarily from increased compensation expense of approximately million  of which approximately million was related to the buffalo stations  higher music license fees  primarily from the buffalo stations  and syndication expenses related to our free beer hot wings syndicated show 
these programming expense increases were partially offset by a savings in programming research expense 
promotion and advertising expenses increased approximately primarily due to the buffalo stations  partially offset by savings in several of our other markets 
sales expense increased due primarily to compensation costs related to increased revenue  primarily from the buffalo stations  and increased rating service costs related to the buffalo stations  as well as one new station in albany  new york and two new stations in peoria  illinois 
our interactive initiative was launched in and the increase in expense primarily represents compensation expense for our newly hired interactive sales managers and program directors  website and streaming fees  and music license fees 
administrative expense increased by  due primarily to increased compensation  rent and health care expenses from the buffalo stations  partially offset by lower franchise tax expense and bad debt expense 
barter expenses increased primarily due to the results of the buffalo stations 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million in was flat compared to amortization decreased by approximately million due primarily to lower amortization expense in our bloomington  illinois and st 
cloud  minnesota markets  as certain definite lived intangibles became fully amortized in those markets in the decrease was partially offset by the amortization of certain definite lived intangible assets acquired in conjunction with our buffalo  new york and peoria  illinois station acquisitions in the second half of depreciation expense increased by approximately million in  due primarily to the depreciation of assets in our buffalo market for the full year  partially offset by decreased depreciation expense for certain assets that became fully depreciated in corporate expense corporate general and administrative expense increased approximately or million to approximately million in the increase was due primarily to increased non cash compensation expense related to the issuance of nonvested stock and increased board expenses 
activist defense costs in the third quarter of  we incurred approximately million in legal and other costs related to the settlement of a stockholder activist lawsuit 
further information pertaining to this matter was filed on the company s form k dated september  impairment of indefinite lived intangible assets in conjunction with our annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we determined that the fair value of goodwill and fcc licenses for certain markets were less than the carrying values recorded in our financial statements 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of the fcc license and goodwill impairment was due to a combination of factors  including the adjustment of certain metrics used to measure the discounted cash flow utilized in the valuation  and the adjustment of cash flow multiples to reflect current industry conditions 
in  we recorded impairment of fcc licenses and goodwill of approximately million  which includes million of impairment expense that has been reclassified to discontinued operations 
interest expense interest expense increased to approximately million in from approximately million in the increase in interest expense was due to a combination of higher average interest rates and increased average outstanding balances under our credit agreement during interest expense in included a non cash charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter from the write off of deferred financing costs related to our previous credit agreement 
interest rates increased due to increases in libor rates  as well as higher margins applicable to borrowings under our new credit agreement 
the higher outstanding debt levels during the year were due primarily to borrowings made under our new credit agreement to fund the purchase of our buffalo  new york stations during the fourth quarter of our average debt level in was approximately million  compared to approximately million in income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit on loss from continuing operations of approximately million in  which represented a effective rate 
the rate includes a tax benefit at a federal rate and a state tax benefit of approximately  offset by other permanent item adjustments  primarily related to the write off of non tax deductible goodwill  of 
we recorded an income tax benefit of approximately million in on loss from continuing operations  which represented a effective rate 
the rate includes a tax benefit at a federal rate  a state tax benefit of  and miscellaneous adjustments of 
in  we determined that it was not necessary to record an additional valuation allowance against our federal net operating loss carryforwards that expire in years through  based on estimated future taxable income during those years 
our estimated future taxable income in those periods takes into consideration anticipated future reductions in interest expense due to scheduled debt repayments through  as well as the run off of significant tax amortization related to existing fcc licenses and tax deductible goodwill by we have cumulative gross federal and state tax loss carryforwards of approximately million at december   which expire in the years through the utilization of a portion of these net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes is limited  pursuant to the annual utilization limitations provided under the provisions of internal revenue code section discontinued operations we applied the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no

same station results our revenues are produced exclusively by our radio stations 
while acquisitions have affected the comparability of our operating results to those of  we believe meaningful quarter to quarter net broadcast revenue comparisons can be made for results of operations for those stations which we have been operating in continuing operations for five full quarters  exclusive of stations disposed of during those years 
we believe this presentation is important because it presents a more direct view of the effectiveness of our stations operations 
nevertheless  this measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for broadcast net revenue  operating income loss  net income loss  net cash provided by used in operating activities or any other measure for determining our operating performance or liquidity that is calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles

the increase in programming expense was due primarily to increased compensation expense  music license fees and research costs  which were partially offset by a savings in program rights related to the howard stern show which was replaced in albany  new york by a new morning show 
the increased promotion expense was due to promotional expenses associated with the launching of two new stations in our peoria  illinois market and one new station and three new formats in our albany  new york market 
sales expense increased due primarily to compensation costs related to increased revenue  as well as increased rating service costs

loss on sale of radio stations during  we sold three radio stations in our peoria  illinois market and one radio station in our evansville  indiana market 
the sale of the stations did not qualify for discontinued operations treatment under the provisions of sfas we recorded a loss on the sale of the peoria stations of approximately million  offset by a gain on the sale of the evansville station of approximately million 
interest expense interest expense increased from approximately million in to approximately million in the increase in interest expense was due to a combination of higher average interest rates  increased average outstanding balances under our current and former credit agreements during  and a non cash charge of approximately million that we recorded in the fourth quarter from the write off of deferred financing costs related to our previous credit agreement 
interest rates increased due to a combination of libor rate increases  combined with higher margins applicable to our borrowings under the new credit agreement 
the increases in outstanding borrowings during the year were related to borrowings of approximately million during the first nine months of to fund the repurchase of shares under our stock buyback program  and borrowings under our new credit agreement to fund the purchase of our buffalo  new york stations 
our average debt level in was approximately million  compared to approximately million in other income  net in  we recorded approximately million of investment income  related primarily to earnings on the escrow payment we made to secure our obligation under the buffalo asset purchase agreement

liquidity and capital resources executive overview we believe the cash generated from operations and available borrowings under our credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our requirements for corporate expenses and capital expenditures over the next months  based on our projected operations and indebtedness and after giving effect to scheduled credit agreement commitment reductions
