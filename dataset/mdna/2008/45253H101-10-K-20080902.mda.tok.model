item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since our inception  we have been principally engaged in the development of novel  targeted therapeutics for the treatment of cancer using our expertise in cancer biology  monoclonal antibodies  and small molecule cytotoxic  or cell killing  agents 
our tumor activated prodrug  or tap  technology uses antibodies to deliver a potent cytotoxic agent specifically to cancer targets  and consists of a monoclonal antibody that binds to a cancer target with one of our proprietary cell killing agents attached 
the antibody component enables a tap compound to bind specifically to cancer cells that express a particular target antigen and the cytotoxic agent serves to kill the cancer cell 
our tap technology is designed to enable the creation of highly effective  well tolerated anticancer products 
all of our and our collaborative partners tap compounds currently in preclinical and clinical testing contain either dm or dm as the cytotoxic agent 
both dm and dm are our proprietary derivatives of a naturally occurring substance called maytansine 
we also use our expertise in antibodies and cancer biology to develop naked  or unconjugated  antibody anticancer product candidates 
we have entered into collaborative agreements that enable companies to use our tap technology to develop commercial product candidates containing their antibodies 
we have also used our proprietary tap technology in conjunction with our in house antibody expertise to develop our own anticancer product candidates 
under the terms of our collaborative agreements  we are generally entitled to upfront license fees  milestone payments  and royalties on any commercial product sales 
in addition  under certain agreements we are entitled to research and development funding based on activities performed at our collaborative partner s request 
we are reimbursed certain of our direct and overhead costs to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials and  under certain collaborative agreements  the reimbursement includes a profit margin 
currently  our collaborative partners include amgen  inc  biogen idec inc  biotest ag  genentech  inc  and sanofi aventis 
we expect that substantially all of our revenue for the foreseeable future will result from payments under our collaborative arrangements 

table of contents sanofi aventis in july  we entered into a discovery  development and commercialization collaboration with sanofi aventis 
under the terms of this agreement  in consideration of an upfront payment of million  sanofi aventis gained worldwide commercialization rights to new anticancer therapeutics developed to targets included in the collaboration  including the right to use our tap technology and our humanization technology in the creation of therapeutics to these targets 
the agreement included a research support funding commitment by sanofi aventis for million over the first three years of the agreement  and then for an additional million when the agreement was extended for a fourth year  and then for an additional million when the agreement was extended for a fifth year 
through the end of fiscal  we have earned million of committed research funding for activities performed under the agreement  of which million  million  and million was recognized during fiscal years  and  respectively 
as of june   we have million of committed research funding remaining under this arrangement 
the collaboration agreement also provides for certain other payments based on the achievement of product candidate milestones and royalties on sales of any resulting products  if and when such sales commence 
assuming all benchmarks are met  we will receive payments of between million and million  per antigen target  for each product candidate developed under this agreement 
through the end of fiscal  we have earned million of a potential million with the achievement of various milestones related to five of the targets included in this collaboration 
additionally  in october  sanofi aventis licensed non exclusive rights to use our proprietary humanization technology  which enables antibodies of murine origin to avoid detection by the human immune system 
this license provides sanofi aventis with the non exclusive right to use our proprietary humanization technology through august  with the right to extend for one or more additional periods of three years each by providing us with written notice prior to expiration of the then current license term 
under the terms of the license  we are due a million license fee  half of which was paid upon contract signing and the second half was paid in august  and in addition  we are entitled to receive milestone payments potentially totaling million plus royalties on sales for each antibody humanized under this agreement 
we have deferred the  portion of the upfront payment already received and are recognizing this amount as revenue over the five year term of the agreement 
in august  sanofi aventis exercised its option under a agreement for expanded access to our tap technology 
the exercise of this option enables sanofi aventis to evaluate  with certain restrictions  our maytansinoid tap technology with antibodies to targets not included in the existing research collaboration between the companies and to license the exclusive right to use the technology to develop products to specific targets on the terms in the agreement 
we are entitled to earn upfront and milestone payments potentially totaling million per target for each compound developed under the agreement  as well as royalties on commercial sales 
we are also entitled to manufacturing payments for any materials made on behalf of sanofi aventis 
we received million with the exercise of this option in august  in addition to the  we received in december with the signing of the option agreement 
the agreement has a three year term from the date of the exercise of the option and can be renewed by sanofi aventis for one additional three year term by payment of a million fee 
genentech in may  we entered into a license agreement with genentech that granted genentech exclusive rights to use our maytansinoid tap technology with antibodies that target her we received a million upfront payment upon execution of the agreement 
in addition to royalties on net sales of any her targeting tap compounds developed under this agreement if and when they occur  the terms of the agreement include other payments based upon genentech s achievement of milestones 
in may  we amended this agreement which increased the potential milestone payments and royalties 
assuming all requirements are met under this agreement  we are to receive million 
table of contents in milestone payments under this agreement in addition to royalties on sales  if any 
through the end of fiscal  we have received million in milestone payments 
biogen idec inc in october  we entered into a development and license agreement with biogen idec ma inc under the terms of the agreement  biogen idec received exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize anticancer therapeutics using antibodies to the tumor cell target cripto and a maytansinoid cell killing agent developed by us 
biogen idec is responsible for the research  development  manufacturing  and marketing of any products resulting from the license 
under the terms of the agreement  we received from biogen idec an upfront payment of million upon execution of the agreement 
in january  biogen idec submitted an ind for their tap compound  biib  to the fda 
we earned a million milestone payment with this event 
assuming all benchmarks are met  we could receive up to million in milestone payments under this agreement 
we are also entitled to receive royalties on net sales of resulting products 
we will also receive compensation from biogen idec for product development research done on its behalf  as well as for the production of preclinical and clinical materials 
to date  we have not generated revenues from commercial product sales and we expect to incur significant operating losses for the foreseeable future 
as of june   we had approximately million in cash and marketable securities compared to million in cash and marketable securities as of june  we anticipate that total cash expenditures will be partially offset by collaboration derived proceeds  including milestone payments and upfront fees 
accordingly  period to period operational results may fluctuate dramatically based upon the timing of receipt of the proceeds 
we believe that our established collaborative agreements  while subject to specified milestone achievements  will provide funding to assist us in meeting obligations under our collaborative agreements while also assisting in providing funding for the development of internal product candidates and technologies 
however  we can give no assurances that such collaborative agreement funding will  in fact  be realized in the time frames we expect  or at all 
should we or our partners not meet some or all of the terms and conditions of our various collaboration agreements  we may be required to pursue additional strategic partners  secure alternative financing arrangements  and or defer or limit some or all of our research  development and or clinical projects 
however  we cannot provide assurance that any such opportunities presented by additional strategic partners or alternative financing arrangements will be entirely available to us  if at all 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our collaborative agreements and inventory 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into licensing and development agreements with collaborative partners for the development of monoclonal antibody based anticancer therapeutics 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  or sab  and emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with 
table of contents multiple elements  or eitf in accordance with sab and eitf  we recognize revenue related to research activities as they are performed  as long as there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the related receivable is probable 
the terms of our agreements contain multiple elements which typically include non refundable license fees  payments based upon the achievement of certain milestones and royalties on product sales 
we evaluate such arrangements to determine if the deliverables are separable into units of accounting and then apply applicable revenue recognition criteria to each unit of accounting 
at june   we had the following four types of collaborative contracts with the parties identified below license to use our tap technology for a single antigen single target license biogen idec inc biotest ag boehringer ingelheim international gmbh terminated in august genentech  inc multiple single target licenses millennium pharmaceuticals  inc terminated in july broad option agreements to acquire exclusive rights to use our tap technology with antibodies to a limited number of targets over a specified time period broad option agreement amgen  inc genentech  inc broad agreement to discover  develop and commercialize antibody based anticancer products sanofi aventis non exclusive license to our humanization technology sanofi aventis generally  the foregoing collaboration agreements provide that we will i at the collaborator s request  manufacture and provide to them preclinical and clinical materials at our cost  or  in some cases  cost plus a margin  ii earn payments upon the collaborators achievements of certain milestones and iii earn royalty payments  generally until the later of the last applicable patent expiration or twelve years after product launch 
we are required to provide technical training and to share any process improvements and know how with our collaborators during the research term of the collaboration agreements 
generally  upfront payments on single target licenses are deferred over the period of our substantial involvement during development 
the determination of the length of this period is subject to judgment and estimation and can have an impact on the amount of revenue recognized in a given period 
our employees are available to assist our collaborators during the development of their products 
we estimate this development phase to begin at the inception of the collaboration agreement and conclude at the end of non pivotal phase ii testing 
we believe this period of involvement is  depending on the nature of the license  on average six and one half years 
quarterly  we reassess our periods of substantial involvement over which we amortize our upfront license fees 
in the event that a single target license were to be terminated  we would recognize as revenue any portion of the upfront fee that had not previously been recorded as revenue  but was classified as deferred revenue at the date of such termination 

table of contents we defer upfront payments received from our broad option agreements over the period during which the collaborator may elect to receive a license 
these periods are specific to each collaboration agreement  but are between seven and years 
if a collaborator selects an option to acquire a license under these agreements  any option fee is deferred and recorded over the life of the option  generally to months 
if a collaborator exercises an option and we grant a single target license to the collaborator  we defer the license fee and account for the fee as we would an upfront payment on a single target license  as discussed above 
upon exercise of an option to acquire a license  we would recognize any remaining deferred option fee over the period of our substantial involvement under the license acquired 
in the event a broad option agreement were to be terminated  we would recognize as revenue any portion of the upfront fee that had not previously been recorded as revenue  but was classified as deferred revenue at the date of such termination 
in the event a collaborator elects to discontinue development of a specific product candidate under a single target license  but retains its right to use our technology to develop an alternative product candidate to the same target or a target substitute  we would cease amortization of any remaining portion of the upfront fee until there is substantial preclinical activity on another product candidate and our remaining period of substantial involvement can be estimated 
when milestone fees are specifically tied to a separate earnings process and are deemed to be substantive and at risk  revenue is recognized when such milestones are achieved 
in addition  we recognize research and development support revenue from certain collaboration and development agreements based upon the level of research services performed during the period of the research agreement 
deferred revenue substantially represents amounts received under collaborative agreements and not yet earned pursuant to these policies 
where we have no continuing involvement  we will record non refundable license fees as revenue upon receipt and will record revenue upon achievement of milestones by our collaborative partners 
we produce preclinical and clinical materials for our collaborators 
we are reimbursed for certain of our direct and overhead costs to produce clinical materials 
we recognize revenue on preclinical and clinical materials when the materials have passed all quality testing required for collaborator acceptance and title and risk of loss have transferred to the collaborator 
we also produce research material for potential collaborators under material transfer agreements 
additionally  we perform research activities  including developing antibody specific conjugation processes  on behalf of our collaborators and potential collaborators during the early evaluation and preclinical testing stages of drug development 
generally  we are reimbursed for certain of our direct and overhead costs of producing these materials or providing these services 
we record the amounts received for the materials produced or services performed as a component of research and development support 
we have also been retained by two of our collaborators to develop conjugation processes for materials for later stage testing and commercialization 
we are reimbursed for certain of our direct and overhead costs and may receive milestone payments for developing these processes and these are recorded as a component of research and development support 
inventory we review our estimates of the net realizable value of our inventory at each reporting period 
our estimate of the net realizable value of our inventory is subject to judgment and estimation 
the actual net realizable value of our inventory could vary significantly from our estimates 
we consider quantities of raw materials in excess of twelve month projected usage that is not supported by firm  fixed collaborator orders and projections at the time of the assessment to be excess 
during fiscal  we obtained additional amounts of dmx from a new supplier 
due to the need to evaluate the process which was developed to prepare such material from this new supplier across multiple batches  we had committed to a level of production which yielded more material than will be required by our collaborators over the next twelve months 
as a result  during the year ended june   we 
table of contents recorded a million charge to research and development expense related to raw material inventory identified as excess 
we also recorded million to write down the raw material inventory purchased during the current period to its net realizable value  which is also included in research and development expense for the year ended june  no similar costs were recorded during the year ended june   and  was recorded during the year ended june  our collaborators estimates of their clinical material requirements are based upon expectations of their clinical trials  including the timing  size  dosing schedule and the maximum tolerated dose likely to be reached for the compound being evaluated 
our collaborators actual requirements for clinical materials may vary significantly from their projections 
significant differences between our collaborators actual manufacturing orders and their projections could result in our actual twelve month usage of raw materials varying significantly from our estimated usage at an earlier reporting period 
reductions in collaborators projections could indicate that we have additional excess raw material inventory and we would then evaluate the need to record further write downs  which would be included as charges to research and development expense 
stock based compensation as of june   the company is authorized to grant future awards under one share based compensation plan  which is the immunogen  inc employee  director and consultant equity incentive plan 
effective july   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement no 
r  share based payment  or statement r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted  but not yet vested as of july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or statement  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to july   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of statement r 
such amounts have been reduced by our estimate of forfeitures of all unvested awards 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based exclusively on historical volatility data of our stock 
the expected term of stock options granted is based exclusively on historical data and represents the period of time that stock options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term is calculated for and applied to one group of stock options as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post vesting termination behavior amongst our employee population 
the risk free rate of the stock options is based on the us treasury rate in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the stock options 
estimated forfeitures are based on historical data as well as current trend 
compensation cost incurred during the year ended june  was million 
compensation cost incurred during each year ended june  and was million 
investment in marketable securities we invest in marketable securities of highly rated financial institutions and investment grade debt instruments and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one entity 
these investments are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  or statement we have classified our marketable securities as available for sale and  accordingly  carry such securities at aggregate fair value 
in accounting for investments  we evaluate if a decline in the fair value of a marketable security below our cost basis is other than temporary  and if so  we record an impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations 
the factors that we consider in our evaluation include the fair market value of the security  the duration and magnitude of the security s decline  and our intent and ability to hold the security to recovery 
the determination of whether a loss is other than temporary is highly judgmental 
table of contents and can have a material impact on our results 
during the fiscal year ended june   we recorded approximately  in other than temporary impairment charges 
no similar charges were recorded in fiscal years ended june  and derivatives derivative instruments include a portfolio of short duration foreign currency forward contracts intended to mitigate the risk of exchange rate fluctuations for manufacturing development contracts to be paid in euros 
derivatives are estimated at fair value and classified as other current assets or liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of these instruments represent the present value of estimated future cash flows under the contracts  which are a function of underlying interest rates  currency rates  related volatility  counterparty creditworthiness and duration of the contracts 
changes in these factors or a combination thereof may affect the fair value of these instruments 
we do not designate foreign currency forward contracts as hedges for accounting purposes  and changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized in earnings during the period of change 
because we enter into forward contracts only as an economic hedge  any gain or loss on the underlying foreign denominated balance would be offset by the loss or gain on the forward contract 
net gains recognized on forward contracts for the years ended june  and were  and  respectively  and are included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations as other income  net 
as of june   we had outstanding forward contracts with amounts equivalent to approximately million  in euros  all maturing on or before august  as of june   we had outstanding forward contracts with amounts equivalent to approximately million million in euros 
as of june   there were no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 
we do not anticipate using derivative instruments for any purpose other than hedging our exchange rate exposure 
results of operations revenues our total revenues for the year ended june  were million compared with million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the million increase in revenues in fiscal from fiscal is primarily attributable to higher revenues from clinical materials reimbursement and license and milestone fees  as discussed below 
the million increase in revenues in fiscal from fiscal is primarily attributable to higher revenues from research development support and clinical materials reimbursement  as well as increases in license and milestone fees  as discussed below 
research and development support was million for the year ended june   million for the year ended june   million for the year ended june  these amounts primarily represent committed research funding earned based on actual resources utilized under our discovery  development and commercialization agreement with sanofi aventis  as well as amounts earned for resources utilized under our development and license agreements with biogen idec  biotest  centocor  and genentech 
under the terms of the sanofi aventis agreement  we are entitled to receive committed research funding totaling not less than million over the five years of the research collaboration  which includes the initial three year term of the research program ending august   plus the two month extensions beginning september  also included in research and development support revenue are fees related to samples of research grade material shipped to collaborators 
to date  our development fees represent the direct and overhead costs incurred in producing research grade materials and developing antibody specific conjugation processes on behalf of our collaborators and potential collaborators during the early evaluation and preclinical 
table of contents testing stages of drug development 
the amount of development fees we earn is directly related to the number of our collaborators and potential collaborators  the stage of development of our collaborators product candidates and the resources our collaborators allocate to the development effort 
as such  the amount of development fees may vary widely from quarter to quarter and year to year 
total revenue recognized from research and development support from each of our collaborative partners in the years ended june   and is included in the following table in thousands year ended june  collaborative partner sanofi aventis biogen idec biotest centocor genentech other total revenue from license and milestone fees for the year ended june  increased approximately million to million from million in the year ended june  revenue from license and milestone fees for the year ended june  was million

table of contents clinical materials reimbursement increased by approximately million to million in the year ended june  compared to million in the year ended june  we earned clinical materials reimbursement of million during the year ended june  during the years ended june   and  we shipped clinical materials in support of a number of clinical trials including  for certain of these years  those of t dm  ave  sar  biib  bt  and of centocor s planned clinical testing of their antibody dmx conjugate now called imgn  as well as preclinical materials in support of the development efforts of certain other collaborators and dmx shipments to certain collaborators in support of development and manufacturing efforts 
the increase in clinical materials reimbursement in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily related to million in revenue recognized from supplying dmx to a collaborator  along with the advancement of the clinical trials of ave and sar the increase in clinical materials reimbursement in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily related to the advancement of the clinical trials of t dm  along with significant amounts of dmx used in development efforts 
we are reimbursed for our direct and overhead costs to produce clinical materials plus  for certain programs  a profit margin 
the amount of clinical materials reimbursement we earn  and the related cost of clinical materials charged to research and development expense  is directly related to i the number of clinical trials our collaborators have or plan to have underway  the speed of enrollment in those trials  the dosage schedule of each clinical trial and the time period  if any  during which patients in the trial receive clinical benefit from the clinical materials  and ii our production of clinical grade material on behalf of our collaborators  either in anticipation of clinical trials  or for process development and analytical purposes 
as such  the amount of clinical materials reimbursement and the related cost of clinical materials charged to research and development expense may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year 
research and development expenses our net research and development expenses relate to i research to identify and evaluate new targets and to develop and evaluate new antibodies  linkers and cytotoxic agents  ii preclinical testing of our own and  in certain instances  our collaborators product candidates  and the cost of our own clinical trials  iii development related to clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and iv manufacturing operations 
our research and development efforts have been primarily focused in the following areas activities pursuant to our discovery  development and commercialization agreement with sanofi aventis  activities pursuant to our development and license agreements with various other collaborators  activities related to the preclinical and clinical development of imgn  imgn and imgn  process development related to production of the hun antibody and imgn conjugate for clinical materials  process development related to production of the huc antibody and imgn conjugate for clinical materials  process development related to production of imgn conjugate for clinical materials  process improvements related to the production of dm  dm and strain development of their precursor  ansamitocin p  funded development activities with contract manufacturers for the hun antibody  the huc antibody and dm  dm and their precursor  ansamitocin p  
table of contents operation and maintenance of our conjugate manufacturing facility  including production of our own and our collaborators clinical materials  process improvements to our tap technology  identification and evaluation of potential antigen targets  evaluation of internally developed and or in licensed product candidates and technologies  and development and evaluation of additional cytotoxic agents and linkers 
research and development expense for the year ended june  increased million to million from million for the year ended june  research and development expense was million for the year ended june  the average number of our research and development personnel increased to for the year ended june  compared to at june  we had an average of research and development personnel for the year ended june  research and development salaries and related expenses increased by  in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  and increased by million in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  included in salaries and related expenses for the year ended june  is million of stock compensation costs compared to million of stock compensation costs for fiscal and facilities expense  including depreciation  increased million during the year ended june  as compared to the same period in and increased  in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  the increase in facilities expense in was principally due to an increase in depreciation and amortization and an increase in rent expense 
the increase in depreciation and amortization is due to the acceleration of amortization of leasehold improvements for our cambridge  ma facilities resulting from our move to waltham  ma in fiscal  as well as new capital purchases 
the increase in facilities expense in was principally due to an increase in depreciation and amortization  an increase in salaries and related expenses  and higher utility costs 
included in research and development expenses for the year ended june  is a million charge related to raw material inventory identified as excess and a million charge to write down raw material purchased during that year to its net realizable value 
no similar costs were recorded during fiscal  and  was recorded during fiscal reserve requirements for excess quantities of ansamitocin p and dmx are principally determined based on our collaborators forecasted demand compared to our inventory position 
the dmx purchased during the year was produced by a supplier in conjunction with process scale up  resulting in more material being produced than was anticipated to be required by our collaborators in the next twelve months 
due to lead times required to secure material  process development and the changing requirements of our collaborators  expenses to provide for excess quantities have fluctuated from period to period and we expect that these period fluctuations will continue in the future 
see inventory within our critical accounting policies above for further discussion of our inventory reserve policy 
we are unable to accurately estimate which potential product candidates  if any  will eventually move into our internal preclinical research program 
we are unable to reliably estimate the costs to develop these products as a result of the uncertainties related to discovery research efforts as well as preclinical and clinical testing 
our decision to move a product candidate into the clinical development phase is predicated upon the results of preclinical tests 
we cannot accurately predict which  if any  of the discovery stage product candidates will advance from preclinical testing and move into our internal clinical development program 
the clinical trial and regulatory approval processes for our product candidates that have advanced or that we intend to advance to clinical testing are lengthy  expensive and uncertain in both timing and outcome 
as a result  the pace and timing of the clinical development of our product candidates is highly uncertain and may not ever result in approved products 
completion dates and development costs will vary significantly for each product candidate and are 
table of contents difficult to predict 
a variety of factors  many of which are outside our control  could cause or contribute to the prevention or delay of the successful completion of our clinical trials  or delay or prevent our obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
the costs to take a product through clinical trials are dependent upon  among other factors  the clinical indications  the timing  size and design of each clinical trial  the number of patients enrolled in each trial  and the speed at which patients are enrolled and treated 
product candidates may be found to be ineffective or to cause unacceptable side effects during clinical trials  may take longer to progress through clinical trials than anticipated  may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals or may prove impractical to manufacture in commercial quantities at reasonable cost or with acceptable quality 
the lengthy process of securing fda approvals for new drugs requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals would materially adversely affect our product development efforts and our business overall 
accordingly  we cannot currently estimate  with any degree of certainty  the amount of time or money that we will be required to expend in the future on our product candidates prior to their regulatory approval  if such approval is ever granted 
as a result of these uncertainties surrounding the timing and outcome of our clinical trials  we are currently unable to estimate when  if ever  our product candidates that have advanced into clinical testing will generate revenues and cash flows 
we do not track our research and development costs by project 
since we use our research and development resources across multiple research and development projects  we manage our research and development expenses within each of the categories listed in the following table and described in more detail below in thousands year ended june  research and development research preclinical and clinical testing process and product development manufacturing operations total research and development expense research research includes expenses associated with activities to identify and evaluate new targets and to develop and evaluate new antibodies  linkers and cytotoxic agents for our product candidates and in support of our collaborators 
such expenses primarily include personnel  fees to in license certain technology  facilities and lab supplies 
research expenses decreased  to million in from and increased million to million in from the decrease in research expenses in was principally the result of a decrease in salaries and related expenses  partially offset by an increase in facilities expense 
included in salaries and related expense for the year ended june  were severance costs related to the departure of an executive 
we also reorganized departments in march  resulting in lower personnel costs included in research expenses for the current year 
the increase in research expenses in was principally the result of an increase in salaries and related expenses  and to a lesser extent  facilities expense 

table of contents preclinical and clinical testing preclinical and clinical testing includes expenses related to preclinical testing of our own and  in certain instances  our collaborators product candidates  and the cost of our own clinical trials 
such expenses include personnel  patient enrollment at our clinical testing sites  consultant fees  contract services  and facility expenses 
preclinical and clinical testing expenses increased  to million in from and  to million in from the increase in was primarily the result of a  milestone fee incurred with a third party related to gaining authorization from the fda to begin clinical testing with imgn  as well as increased consulting and recruiting fees 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in salaries and related expense resulting from a decrease in personnel due to turnover 
in there were substantial increases in salaries and related expense  the result of an increase in personnel to support both our own as well as our collaborators preclinical and clinical activities  as well as salary increases 
contract service expense increased substantially in due principally to various toxicity studies related to imgn and imgn process and product development process and product development expenses include costs for development of clinical and commercial manufacturing processes for our own and collaborator compounds 
such expenses include the costs of personnel  contract services and facility expenses 
total development expenses increased  to million in from and increased  to million in from the increase in is primarily the result of an increase in facilities expense 
the increase in is primarily the result of an increase in salaries and related expenses due to increases in personnel  and to a lesser extent  facilities expense 
partially offsetting these increases in  contract service expense decreased significantly due principally to a decrease in process development costs related to ansamitocins p and dmx 
manufacturing operations manufacturing operations expense includes costs to manufacture preclinical and clinical materials for our own and our collaborators product candidates  quality control and quality assurance activities and costs to support the operation and maintenance of our conjugate manufacturing facility 
such expenses include personnel  raw materials for our and our collaborators preclinical studies and clinical trials  development costs with contract manufacturing organizations  manufacturing supplies  and facilities expense 
manufacturing operations expense increased million to million in from and increased million to million in from the increase in was primarily the result of i an increase in supply of dmx and clinical materials to our collaborators  ii an increase in salaries and related expenses due to an increase in personnel  as well as salary increases  iii an increase in antibody supply and development expenses  iv an increase in facilities expense  and v an increase in charges incurred related to the write down of raw material inventory purchased during the year to its net realizable value and raw material inventory identified as excess 
partially offsetting these increases contract service expense decreased due primarily to lower dmx development costs for the potential production of later stage materials 
the increase in was primarily the result of i an increase in supply of dmx and clinical materials to our collaborators  ii an increase in salaries and related expenses due to an increase in personnel  as well as salary increases  iii an increase in contract service expense substantially due to higher development costs with contract manufacturing organizations for the potential production of later stage materials  iv an increase in consulting fees  and v an increase in the cost of disposable and chemical supplies due to increased production  batch scale  and pricing 
antibody expense in anticipation of potential future clinical trials  as well as our ongoing trials  was million in  million in  and million in the process of antibody production is lengthy as is the lead time to establish a satisfactory production process at a vendor 
accordingly  costs incurred related to antibody production and development have fluctuated from period to period and we expect these cost fluctuations to continue in the future 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased million to million from million for the year ended june  general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  were million

such amounts should be recognized as expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
entities should continue to evaluate whether they expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
some of our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments that would require disclosure under this item 
our foreign currency hedging program uses forward contracts to manage the foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
the contracts are denominated in euros and have maturities of less than one year 
our foreign currency risk management strategy is principally designed to mitigate the future potential financial impact of changes in the value of transactions  anticipated transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency  resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our market risks associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates are concentrated primarily in a portfolio of short duration foreign currency forward contracts 
generally  these contracts provide that we receive certain foreign currencies and pay us dollars at specified exchange rates at specified future dates 
although we are exposed to credit and market risk in the event of future nonperformance by a counterparty  management has no reason to believe that such an event will occur
