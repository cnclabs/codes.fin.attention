item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a wayzata  minnesota based full service electronics manufacturing services ems contract manufacturer of wire and cable assemblies  printed circuit board assemblies  higher level assemblies and box builds for a wide range of industries 
markets served include industrial equipment  transportation  medical  military defense  agriculture  oil  gas  computer  recreation and food 
in minnesota  we have facilities in baxter  bemidji  blue earth  fairmont and merrifield 
we also have facilities in augusta  wisconsin  garner  iowa and monterrey  mexico 
the vast majority of our revenue is derived from products that are built to the customer s design specifications 
we provide a high degree of manufacturing sophistication 
during  we continued our supply chain initiatives designed to reduce costs  improve asset utilization and increase responsiveness to customers 
our strategy has been to expand and diversify our customer base  and we are focusing our sales and marketing approach to target greater value added service opportunities 
our market strength is low volume  high mix production  particularly with complex products 
our continued investment in our mexico operation allows for expansion into medium volume  medium mix and lower cost production and our contractual arrangements with chinese manufacturers allow us to meet higher volume  lower mix and lower cost customer requirements 
during  we experienced growth in our sales  gross profit  and net income 
for the years ended december  we had sales of million  compared to million for the increase of million was a improvement over for the years ended december  and  we had gross profit of million and million  respectively 
gross profits as a percentage of gross sales were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our net income in was  or per diluted common share compared to  or per diluted common share in critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies and estimates are summarized in the footnotes to our annual consolidated financial statements 
some of the accounting policies require us to exercise significant judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
such judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  known trends in the industry  terms of existing contracts and other information from outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
certain of the most critical policies that require significant judgment are as follows 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to customers  when title has passed  all contractual obligations have been satisfied  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
in the normal course of business we enter into a number of contracts with customers under which we provide engineering services on a per project basis 
revenue for these services is recognized upon completion of the engineering process  usually upon initial shipment of the product 
revenues from repair services are recognized upon shipment of related equipment to customers 
allowance for uncollectible accounts when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze accounts receivable  historical write offs of bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount estimated to be sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the realizability of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for uncollectible accounts may be required 
we have not experienced significant bad debts expense and the reserve for uncollectible accounts of  is considered adequate for any exposure to loss in the december  accounts receivable 
inventory reserves inventory reserves are maintained for the estimated value of the inventory that may have a lower value than stated or quantities in excess of future production needs 
we have an evaluation process that is used to assess the value of the inventory that is slow moving  excess or obsolete on a quarterly basis 
we believe the total reserve of million at december  is adequate 
long lived and intangible asset impairment we evaluate long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment  as well as the related amortization periods  to determine whether adjustments to these amounts or useful lives are required based on current events and circumstances 
the evaluation is based on our projection of the undiscounted future operating cash flows of the underlying assets 
to the extent such projections indicate that future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of related assets  a charge is recorded to reduce the carrying amount to equal estimated fair value 
the test for impairment requires us to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
the estimates associated with the asset impairment tests are considered critical due to the judgments required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
income taxes our estimate of the tax rates utilized in the calculation of the deferred tax balances is based on historical taxable income and expected future taxable income and corresponding rates 
further  our consideration of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is based upon estimates of taxable income in future periods and future realizability of these assets 
self insured health claim accruals we estimate our reserve for employee health claims based on health claims incurred  historical lag times and an analysis of claims activity during the period  while taking into consideration insurance limits and coverage 
we believe the total accrual of  at december  is adequate 
stock based compensation we follow the provisions of sfas r  share based payment which requires us to measure and recognize in our consolidated statements of operations the expense associated with all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to measure the amount of compensation expense to be recognized for each option award 
there are several assumptions that must be made when using the black scholes model such as the expected term of each option  the expected volatility of the stock price during the expected term of the option  the expected dividends to be paid and the risk free interest rate expected during the option term 
of these assumptions  the expected term of the option and expected volatility of our common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of employees and the expected future performance of our stock 
an increase in the volatility of our stock price or an increase in the average period before exercise will increase the amount of compensation expense related to awards granted after december  based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  we believe that our consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair presentation of our financial position 
this is not to suggest that other general risk factors  such as changes in worldwide economic conditions  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in materials costs  performance of acquired businesses and others  could not adversely impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
no matters have come to our attention since december  that would cause the estimates included in the consolidated financial statements to change materially

in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin provides that the tax effects from an uncertain tax position can be recognized in our consolidated financial statements  only if the position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
we adopted fin on january  as required by fin  we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
at the adoption date  we applied fin to all tax position for which the statute of limitations remained open 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized a  income tax payable liability for unrecognized income tax benefits as a cumulative change to opening retained earnings as prescribed

on december   we had working capital of approximately million as compared to million at the end of during  we generated approximately million of cash flow from operating activities 
the cash flow from operations is due primarily to net income of million and noncash depreciation  amortization  and other noncash expenses  and the change in deferred taxes  which totaled million in net positive adjustments 
the impact on cash due to changes in operating assets and liabilities was the increased collections of cash due to the reduction of million of accounts receivable and decreases in the amount of cash paid for income taxes of million  which was offset in part by increases in inventory of million 
our net cash used in investing activities of million is primarily due to the million acquisition of garner  iowa  and million of capital equipment purchases 
net cash provided by financing activities of million consisted of drawing million on our line of credit  an increase in long term debt of million  and issuance of shares of common stock of million  all of which was offset by payments of long term debt of million 
we believe that our existing resources and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs for the foreseeable future
