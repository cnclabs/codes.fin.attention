item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are developing miniature display and imaging engines based upon our technology platform 
our technology platform utilizes our expertise in two dimensional micro electrical mechanical systems mems  lasers  optics and electronics to create a high quality video or still image from a small form factor device with lower power needs than conventional display technologies 
in  we announced our strategy to develop and supply a proprietary display engine called picop to potential oem customers who will embed them into a variety of consumer and automotive products 
the primary objective for consumer applications is to provide users of mobile devices with a large screen viewing experience produced by a small embedded projector 
mobile devices may include cell phones  pda s  gaming consoles and other consumer electronics products 
these potential products would allow users to watch movies  play videos  display images  and other data onto a variety of surfaces 
the picop with some modification could be embedded into the dashboard of an automobile or an airplane to create a heads up display hud that could project point by point navigation  critical operational  safety and other information important to the driver or pilot 
the picop could be further modified to be embedded into a pair of glasses to provide the mobile user with a see through or occluded personal display to view movies  play games or access other content 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception and expect to incur a substantial loss during the fiscal year ended december  key accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  contract losses  bad debts  investments and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the display and image capture industries  information provided by our current and prospective customers and strategic partners  information available from other outside sources  and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following key accounting policies require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize contract revenue as work progresses on long term  cost plus fixed fee and fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we use this revenue recognition methodology because we can make reliable estimates of the revenue and costs 
recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion and actual revenue and cost become certain 
revisions in revenue estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
revisions in these estimates could significantly impact recognized revenue in any one reporting period 
if the us government cancels a contract  we would receive payment for work performed and costs committed to prior to the cancellation 
our product sales generally include acceptance provisions 
we recognize revenue for product shipments upon acceptance of the product by the customer or expiration of the contractual acceptance period 
losses on uncompleted contracts 
we establish an allowance for estimated losses if a contract has an estimated cost to complete that is in excess of the remaining contract value 
the entire estimated loss is recorded in the period in which the loss is first determined 
we determine the estimated cost to complete a contract through a detailed review of the work to be completed  the resources available to complete the work and the technical difficulty of the remaining work 
if the revised estimated cost to complete the contract is higher than the total contract revenue  the entire contract loss is recognized 
the actual cost to complete a contract can vary significantly from the estimated cost  due to a variety of factors including availability of technical staff  availability of materials and technical difficulties that arise during a project 
most of our development contracts are cost plus fixed fee type contracts 
under these types of contracts  we are not required to spend more than the contract value to complete the contracted work 
allowance for uncollectible receivables 
we maintain allowances for uncollectible receivables  including accounts receivable  cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and receivables from related parties 
we review several factors in determining the allowances including the customer s and related party s past payment history and financial condition 
if the financial condition of our customers or the related parties with whom we have receivables were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
inventory 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost basis 
we review several factors in determining the market value of our inventory including evaluating the replacement cost of the raw materials and the net realizable value of the finished goods 
if we do not achieve our targeted sales prices  if market conditions for our components or products were to decline or if we do not achieve our sales forecast  additional reductions in the carrying value of the inventory would be required 
employee share based compensation 
we issue share based compensation to employees in the form of options exercisable into our common stock 
we account for employee share based compensation under the guidance provided by financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r  share based payment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of these instruments 
we use this model because it results in reasonable estimated fair values for our standard options  is widely accepted and provides comparability across a wide range of similar companies 
to use the black scholes options pricing model we must evaluate a range of variables and determine estimates of future option lives  stock volatility and interest rates 
in addition  once estimated fair values are developed  we must estimate prevesting forfeiture rates 
changes in these estimates could result in a materially different valuation of the stock based compensation 
other models for valuing stock based compensation exist and the use of an alternative model could result in a materially different valuation of the compensation expense 
the key accounting policies described above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for us to apply judgment or make estimates 
there are also areas in which our judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result to our consolidated financial statements 
additional information about our accounting policies  and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles  are set forth in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
inflation has not had a material impact on our revenues  or income from continuing operations over the three most recent fiscal years 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract revenue 
of of contract contract revenue revenue change change in thousands government revenue   commercial revenue   total contract revenue   we earn contract revenue from performance on development contracts with the united states government and commercial customers 
our contract revenue in a particular period is dependent upon when we enter into a contract  the value of the contracts we have entered into  and the availability of technical resources to perform work on the contracts 
contract revenue was higher during than in  due to higher beginning government contract backlog and an increased level of activity on commercial contracts compared to the prior year 
in may  we announced that we had entered into a million contract with the us air force to provide a lightweight  see through  full color eyewear display prototype to the government 
the contract  which continues a development activity with the air force  specifies the development  design  verification  testing  and delivery of a lightweight  see through full color wearable display for evaluation by several dod project offices 
as long as most of our revenue is earned from performance on development contracts  we believe there may be a high degree of variability in revenue from one period to another 
our backlog of development contracts at december  was million compared to million at december  the backlog is composed of development contracts entered through december  we plan to complete the entire contract backlog during product revenue 
of of product product revenue revenue change change in thousands rov revenue n a flic revenue   nomad revenue total product revenue   we have earned product revenue from sales of rov  flic and nomad 
in may  we announced the launch of rov  our new bar code scanner product 
the rov is based on our proprietary mems technology 
rov is being manufactured by our contract manufacturing partner in malaysia 
we had planned to begin commercial shipments of rov during the third quarter of during our beta evaluation  we determined that rov did not meet our quality standards 
we delayed the launch of rov production until we could correct the deficiencies 
commercial shipments of rov began during the fourth quarter of the decrease in flic revenue in compared to was the result of the timing of the release of rov 
we believe that many of our customers were waiting for the availability of rov before placing orders for our bar code scanning products 
the decrease in nomad revenue was the result of our decision in june to no longer promote the nomad product 
the nomad had not gained the commercial acceptance we had planned when it was introduced 
our quarterly revenue may vary substantially due to the timing of product orders from customers  production constraints and raw material availability 
the backlog of product orders at december  was approximately  compared to  at december   all of which is scheduled for delivery during cost of contract revenue 
of of contract contract revenue revenue change change in thousands cost of contract revenue   cost of contract revenue includes both the direct and allocated indirect costs of performing on development contracts 
direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in performing on a contract 
indirect costs include labor and other costs associated with operating our research and development department and building our technical capabilities and capacity 
cost of contract revenue is determined both by the level of direct costs incurred on development contracts and by the level of indirect costs incurred in operating and building our technical capabilities and capacity 
both the direct and indirect costs can fluctuate substantially from period to period 
the cost of contract revenue as a percentage of revenue was lower in than in as a result of negotiating better terms on contracts entered into in late and early we target a gross margin for each contract of at least  however  the gross margin can vary based on the technical challenges encountered in completing the contract 
the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period  depending on the contract cost mix and the levels of direct and indirect costs incurred 
however  over longer periods of time we expect modest fluctuations in the cost of contract revenue  as a percentage of contract revenue 
cost of product revenue 
of of product product revenue revenue change change in thousands cost of product revenue   cost of product revenue includes both the direct and allocated indirect costs of manufacturing rovs and flics sold to customers 
direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in the manufacture of rov and flic 
indirect costs include labor and other costs associated with operating our manufacturing capabilities and capacity 
our overhead  which includes the costs of procuring  inspecting and storing material  facility and depreciation costs  is allocated to inventory  cost of product revenue  cost of contract revenue  and research and development expense based on the proportion of direct material purchased for the respective activity 
during and  we expensed approximately  and  respectively  of manufacturing overhead associated with production capacity in excess of production requirements 
the decline in cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue for compared to is attributable to the following factors the decision in june to no longer support the nomad product line 
during  we recorded expenses of million associated with the nomad product line that were not repeated in reduced direct cost and overhead on the flic product line resulting in a savings of approximately for the year ended december  compared to the same period in the absence of losses associated with noncancelable purchase contracts 
in  we recorded a loss of  to cost of product revenue as a result of commitments to purchase materials for the flic scanner that were in excess of our estimated future proceeds from the sale of the flic scanners 
we expect that the cost of product revenue on an absolute dollar basis will increase in the future as expected sales of commercial products increase 
the cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period  depending on the product mix  the level of overhead expense and the volume of direct materials purchased 
research and development expense

our research and development department works on both contract revenue projects and internally funded development projects 
we allocate the research and development department overhead to cost of contract revenue and research and development expense based on the proportion of direct labor cost incurred in cost of contract revenue and research and development  respectively 
we have increased spending in research and development as part of our strategy to accelerate the time to market for products based on the picop 
the increase in cost is primarily attributable to increases in payroll costs and contracted services 
we believe that a substantial level of continuing research and development expense will be required to develop additional commercial products using the light scanning technology 
accordingly  we anticipate our level of research and development spending will continue to be substantial 
sales  marketing  general and administrative expense 
change change in thousands sales  marketing  general and administrative    sales  marketing  general and administrative expense includes compensation and support costs for marketing  sales  management and administrative staff  and for other general and administrative costs  including legal and accounting services  consultants and other operating expenses 
in early  we announced our plan to reduce spending in sales  marketing  general and administrative expenses

no provision for income taxes has been recorded because we have experienced net losses from inception through december  at december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes 
in addition  we have research and development tax credits of million 
the net operating losses begin expiring in if not previously utilized 
in certain circumstances  as specified in the internal revenue code  a or more ownership change by certain combinations of our shareholders during any three year period would result in a limitation on our ability to utilize a portion of our net operating loss carry forwards 
we have determined that such a change of ownership occurred during and that the annual utilization of loss carry forwards generated through the period of that change will be limited to approximately  an additional change of ownership occurred in and the annual limitation for losses generated in is approximately million 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on january  we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits which would require an adjustment to the january  beginning balance of retained earnings

our cash requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the rate at which we can  directly or through arrangements with original equipment manufacturers  introduce products incorporating our technology and the market acceptance and competitive position of such products 
future operating expenditures and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the following the progress of research and development programs  the progress in commercialization activities and arrangements  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and our ability to establish cooperative development  joint venture and licensing arrangements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of our total cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale balance  have variable interest rates and  as such  the fair values of the principal of these instruments are not affected by changes in market interest rates 
the remaining of our cash equivalents and investment securities available for sale balance are at fixed interest rates and  as such  the fair values of these instruments are affected by changes in market interest rates 
due to the generally short term maturities of these investment securities  we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is not material 
our investment policy restricts investments to ensure principal preservation and liquidity 
the investment securities portfolio is comprised of short term highly rated commercial paper  us government agency notes and auction rate securities 
at december   million of our marketable securities portfolio was invested in aaa rated investments in auction rate debt securities 
auction rate securities are long term variable rate bonds tied to short term interest rates 
after the initial issuance of the securities  the interest rate on the securities is reset periodically  at intervals established at the time of issuance eg  every seven  fourteen or twenty eight days  based on market demand for a reset period 
auction rate securities are bought and sold in the marketplace through a competitive bidding process often referred to as a dutch auction 
if there is insufficient interest in the securities at the time of an auction  the auction may not be completed and the rates may be reset to predetermined penalty or maximum rates 
following such a failed auction  we would not be able to access our funds that are invested in the corresponding auction rate securities until a future auction of these investments is successful or new buyers express interest in purchasing these securities in between reset dates 
at the time of our initial investment and through the date of this report  all of our auction rate securities in which we invest remain aaa rated 
as of march   we successfully liquidated into cash equivalents  million of the million of auction rate securities held at december  the million equaled our original purchase value 
the remaining million of auction rate securities have been subject to failed auctions in as a result of the current negative liquidity conditions in the global credit markets 
the failed auctions have rendered these securities temporarily illiquid through the normal auction process 
the underlying assets of our remaining auction rate securities are student loans and municipal bonds insured by ambac  and the federal family education loan program 
as of march   ambac was rated aaa by moody s and standard and poor s and aa by fitch ratings 
although these insurers are highly rated  they are reported to be experiencing financial difficulty  which could negatively affect their ratings and thus the ratings of the auction rate securities that we hold 
if the underlying issuers are unable to successfully clear future auctions or if their credit rating deteriorates and the deterioration is deemed to be other than temporary  we would be required to adjust the carrying value of the auction rate securities through an impairment charge to earnings 
any of these events could affect our results of operations and our financial condition 
in the event we need to access these funds  we could be required to sell these securities at an amount below our original purchase value 
however  based on our ability to access our cash and cash equivalents and our other liquid investments  totaling million at december   we do not expect to be required to sell these securities at a loss 
the values of cash equivalents and investment securities  available for sale  by maturity date as of december   are as follows amount percent cash and cash equivalents  less than one year  one to two years  greater than five years  all of the company s development contract payments are made in us dollars 
however  in the future the company may enter into additional development contracts in foreign currencies that may subject the company to foreign exchange rate risk 
the company intends to enter into foreign currency hedges to offset the exposure to currency fluctuations when it can determine the timing and amounts of the foreign currency exposure
