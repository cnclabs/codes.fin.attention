this discussion may contain forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including those set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
unless otherwise stated  references in this report to particular years or quarters refer to our fiscal year and the associated quarters of those fiscal years 
overview we were incorporated in california in under the name omnicell technologies  inc and reincorporated in delaware in as omnicell  inc our healthcare automation solutions are designed to enable healthcare facilities to acquire  manage  dispense and administer medications and medical surgical supplies  and are intended to enhance patient safety  reduce medication errors  improve workflow and increase operational efficiency 
when used in combination  our products and services provide healthcare facilities with a comprehensive solution designed to enhance patient safety and improve operational efficiency 
we sell our medication dispensing and supply automation systems primarily in the united states 
our sales force is organized by geographic region in the united states and canada 
we also sell through distributors in asia  australia  europe  the middle east and south america 
in  we manufactured the majority of our systems in our california facility and refurbishment and spare parts activities were conducted in our illinois facility 
we continued manufacturing sub assemblies at a few single source off shore manufacturing suppliers to provide increased manufacturing capacity 
in  we established a subsidiary in india  omnicell corporation india private limited 
this subsidiary is focused on software product development and customer support 
a substantial number of our u 
s employees involved in sales  customer support and installation work remotely 
in general  we recognize revenue when our medication dispensing and supply automation systems are installed 
installation generally takes place six to nine months after our systems are ordered for all of our products except mobile carts 
installation of mobile carts takes place one to three months after the order is received 
the installation process at our customers sites includes internal procedures associated with large capital expenditures and additional time associated with adopting new technologies 
given the length of time necessary for our customers to plan for and complete their acceptance of the installation of our systems  our focus is on shipping products based on the installation dates requested by our customers and working at the customer s pace 
the amount of revenue recognized in future periods may depend on  among other things  the terms and timing of lease contract renewals  additional product sales and the size of such transactions 
we believe that future revenue will be affected by the competitiveness of our products and services 
we generate substantially all of our revenues in the united states 
our business grew substantially  from million of revenue in to million of revenue in we believe that three factors were primarily responsible for this growth we have continued to differentiate ourselves through a strategy intended to create the best customer experience in healthcare  we have delivered industry leading products with differentiated product features that are designed to appeal to nurses and pharmacists  and the market environment of increased patient safety awareness and increased regulatory control has driven our solutions to be a high priority in customers capital budgets 
in addition to our revenue growth during  our product backlog consisting of orders accepted but not yet installed  grew from million at december  to million at december   as customer orders for our products grew at a rate faster than we were able install 
our customers require well planned installations that provide them with a minimal amount of disruption 
installations  which coincide with full delivery of our obligations to our customers and therefore represent our point of revenue recognition  can take place anywhere from one week to months after an order is received for our products 
given our customers often lengthy installation schedules  we believe our current backlog level is appropriate for our industry and that the increase in backlog is an indicator of the success of our products in the marketplace and the increased attention we have given to carefully planning installations at large institutions and at new customer sites 
we believe that our key business strategies are a significant component to our success in achieving market acceptance of our products and services 
these key strategies include delivering solutions that are designed to provide our customers with the best experience in the healthcare industry by proactively anticipating and meeting customer needs  listening carefully to our customers prospective issues  and meeting and exceeding our customers installation and support needs 
sustaining technological leadership in the development of our products by consistently innovating in our product and service offerings  and maintaining our flexibility in customer product design and in the installation process 
in order to implement these strategies during  we increased our staff during the year to meet customer demands for products  installation and customer support  announced significant new product technologies  such as singlepointe  the industry s first product capable of automated distribution of up to of the medications used in a hospital  acquired a significant technology  mobile cart  through the acquisition of rioux vision  inc  continued a strategy to manufacture sub assemblies at manufacturing supplier locations  providing us the potential for increased manufacturing capacity  increased flexibility and reduced demands on working capital  increased the staffing at our subsidiary in india to take advantage of the large local talent pool and to improve our cost structure and to provide more resources to our customers  and placed increased emphasis on the integration of prior acquisitions to provide customers with higher level of technology integration in our product offerings 
in  we generated positive cash flow from operations because our expenses grew at a slower pace than the overall growth in our revenues and working capital from operations 
additionally  significant investments in plant and equipment were limited to information technology and leasehold improvements 
we completed a secondary offering of our common stock which provided us net proceeds of million 
as a result  net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december  and our cash and cash equivalents balance as of december  was million 
in  net cash provided by operations was million and we had cash and cash equivalents balance as of december  of million 
our ability to grow revenue and produce positive cash flow is dependent on our ability to continue to attract orders from customers  the volume of installations we are able to complete  our ability to access customer installation sites on a timely basis and our flexibility in manpower allocations among customers to complete installations on a timely basis 
the growth we have experienced has also required a substantial growth in our headcount 
during  we were successful in recruiting and integrating new staff members at all of our sites and in our field based organizations 
our full time employee headcount grew to at december  from at december   including employees transferred from rioux vision  inc in  we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
r revised share based payment or sfas no 
r  to record share based awards compensation costs 
total share based compensation expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million in the impact on net income per share for the year ended december  was per share basic and per share diluted compared to per share basic and per share diluted for the year ended december  we anticipate that the growth rate of our cost of product revenue and expenses from share based compensation  may  at times  exceed the future growth rate of our revenues 
we have initiated long term compensation vehicles other than employee stock options to help reduce the future cost of share based compensation programs 
our gross profit improved for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to increased operational leverage and improved operating efficiencies obtained by expanding our installation process in a measured fashion 
however  we believe that our gross margin could decline in as compared to as a result of market price reductions  additional costs to expand our business and expenses from share based compensation expenses 
this decrease in our gross margin may be wholly or partially offset by revenue growth in as compared to  and by component and sub assembly cost reductions 
in  in an effort to provide greater product volume  we initiated a change in our manufacturing process by securing a single source third party manufacturing supplier to build sub assemblies used in our hardware products 
during  we expanded the number of subassemblies manufactured by third parties 
for  we expect our third party manufacturing suppliers to build substantial portions of our required sub assemblies providing us capacity flexibility and reduced inventory levels 
we anticipate reducing our risk of dependence on single source suppliers by establishing additional supplier manufacturing relationships and by securing single source supplier secondary manufacturing sites during profitability of our business grew steadily during in large part due to our efficiencies gained in our cost structure by adding headcount at a slower pace than the growth of revenue 
we have invested in customer facing portions of our business  in research and development and in infrastructure  but at a slower pace than demand for our products has grown 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest in our business to support future growth generated by increased market demand 
during  these investments will include investment in customer and employee training  and an investment in the replacement of enterprise information technology systems  as well as investments in other areas of our business 
we operate in one business segment  the design  manufacturing  selling and servicing of medication and supply dispensing systems 
our management team evaluates our performance based on company wide  consolidated results 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our products are integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of our equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to our integrated software through our maintenance contracts for most of our products 
accordingly  we account for revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of the undelivered elements 
vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
post installation technical support  such as phone support  on site service  parts and access to software upgrades  when and if available  is provided by us under separate support services terms 
we recognize revenue for support services ratably over the related support services contract period 
we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete  based upon our evaluation of whether the following four criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
we use signed customer contracts and signed customer purchase orders as evidence of an arrangement for leases and sales 
for service engagements  we use a signed services agreement and a statement of work to evidence an arrangement 
product delivery 
software and hardware delivery is deemed to occur upon successful installation and receipt of a signed and dated customer confirmation of installation letter providing evidence that we have delivered what the customer ordered 
product delivery is deemed to have occurred upon receipt of a signed and dated customer confirmation letter in instances of a customer self installed installation 
fee is fixed or determinable 
we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we have established a history of collecting under the original contract without providing concessions on payments  products or services 
collection is probable 
we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer s payment history and its current creditworthiness 
if  in our judgment  collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the revenue until the uncertainty is removed  which generally means revenue is recognized upon our receipt of cash payment 
our historical experience has been that collection from our customers is generally probable 
we recognize sales on shipment to distributors since we do not allow for rights of return 
in general  for sales not requiring our installation or modification  we recognize sales on shipment of products to our customers 
we separately sell training and professional services which are not part of multiple element arrangements and not integral to the performance of our systems 
we recognize revenue on training and professional services as they are performed 
vsoe of training and of professional services is based on the price paid when sold separately 
a portion of our sales is made through multi year lease agreements 
we generally sell our non us government leases to third party leasing finance companies on a non recourse basis and recognize revenue on these leases at the net present value of the lease payment stream 
we exclude from revenue amounts paid to us for a new sale that relates to the termination of an existing lease 
generally  we have no obligation to the leasing company once the lease is sold 
some of our lease sales  mostly those relating to us government hospitals  are retained in house as sales type leases which we account for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
we recognize revenue on sales type leases at completion of our installation obligation  if any  and at the beginning of the non cancelable payment terms 
the revenue recognized is calculated at the net present value of the future payment stream 
interest income in sales type leases is recognized in product revenue using the interest method 
provision for reserves 
we continually monitor and evaluate the collectability of our trade receivables and our net investment in sales type leases based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for doubtful accounts when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends  the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
valuation and impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
our accounting of goodwill and intangible assets complies with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining the expected useful lives of the assets 
we continually monitor events and changes in circumstances that could indicate carrying amounts of long lived assets may not be recoverable 
we review long lived assets and certain goodwill and other intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparing its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset  excluding future interest costs that would be recognized as an expense when incurred 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in identifying a triggering event that arises from a change in circumstances  forecasting future operating results  and estimating the proceeds from the disposition of long lived or intangible assets 
in future periods  material impairment charges could be necessary should different conditions prevail or different judgments be made 
inventory 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost utilizing standard costs  which approximate the first in  first out method or market 
we routinely assess our on hand inventory for timely identification and measurement of obsolete  slow moving or otherwise impaired inventory 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of share based awards 
in  we adopted sfas no 
r  and selected a modified prospective transition method using the black scholes merton option price method for determining and for recording the fair value of share based awards compensation costs 
we estimate the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using certain subjective assumptions  such as expected volatility which is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility  and the expected term of the awards  which is based on our historical experience of employee stock option exercises including forfeitures 
the valuation assumptions we use in estimating the fair value of employee share based awards may change in future periods 
we recognize the fair value of awards over the vesting period or the requisite service period 
in addition  we calculate our pool of excess tax benefits available within additional paid in capital in accordance with the provisions sfas no 
r 
accounting for taxes on income 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement prescribes the use of the liability method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded against net deferred tax assets when we believe it is more likely than not that some of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management performs assessments regarding the realization of deferred tax assets considering all available evidence  both positive and negative 
these assessments require that management make significant judgments about many factors  including the amount and likelihood of future taxable income 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
 or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes and interprets the provision of fasb statement no 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fin through a cumulative effect adjustment  resulting in an adjustment of million to the opening balance of accumulated deficit as of january  we must make significant assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against our deferred tax assets 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relating to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and developments in current and future tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relating to the value of our net deferred taxes take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income from potential sources including tax planning strategies that would  if necessary  be implemented to prevent an unused loss carry forward or unused tax credit carry forward from expiring 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate  thus materially affecting our results of operations and financial position 
newly issued accounting standards not yet adopted in december  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  or sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
sfas no 
r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any non controlling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
the statement also establishes disclosure requirements which will enable users to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
r will have an impact on accounting for business combinations once adopted  but the effect is dependent upon acquisitions at that time 
in september  fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements  or sfas no  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and is required to be adopted by us beginning in the first quarter of based on a preliminary evaluation of the impact of adopting sfas no  we believe that it will not have a material impact on our consolidated statements of financial position  results of operations or cash flows

years ended december  in thousands benefit from provision for income taxes  as of december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets before a valuation allowance of million 
generally  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in our opinion  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any 
as of december   the remaining valuation allowance is related to unrecognized stock option deductions that will be credited directly to additional paid in capital when realized 
until  we concluded that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized and therefore we provided a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
in  based upon our current level of profitability as well as the level of forecasted future earnings  it became more likely than not that million of the deferred tax assets would be realized and the valuation allowance was adjusted accordingly 
in evaluating the realizability of the deferred tax assets  we considered all positive evidence against any potential negative evidence in determining that it was more likely than not these assets would be realized 
we will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  we have elected to use the short form method to calculate the tax effects of share based compensation 
under the short form method  we use the cumulative effect of award grants to establish hypothetical additional paid in capital pool related to the tax effects of the employee stock based compensation as if we had adopted the recognition provisions of sfas no 
since its effective date of january  due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  some exercises result in tax deductions in excess of previously recorded benefits based on the option value at the time of grant  or windfalls 
we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  deferred tax assets are not recognized for net operating loss carry forwards resulting from windfall tax benefits occurring from january  onward 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by the company upon an employee s disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that the company had recorded

we invest our cash in cash investments with original or remaining maturities of three months or less and whose principal is not subject to market rate fluctuations 
accordingly  interest rate declines would adversely affect our interest income but would not affect the carrying value of our cash investments 
based on a sensitivity analysis of our cash and cash equivalents as of december   a hypothetical or basis points decrease in interest rates would reduce our quarterly interest income by approximately million 
we are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in interest rates related to components of our product backlog composed of offers to non us government customers for multi year  non cancelable payment terms 
generally we sell non us government receivables to third party leasing finance companies  and we reflect the financing interest expense on the sale of these receivables as a component of our revenue 
we record our revenue at the net present value of the multi year payment stream using the contractual interest rate charged us by the third party leasing company 
as interest rates rise  revenue received from these orders will fall 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical or  basis points adverse movement in interest rates from actual year end interest rates related to underlying exposure of product backlog described above 
as of december   the analysis indicated that this hypothetical market movement would have an adverse effect of approximately million on our consolidated results of operations
