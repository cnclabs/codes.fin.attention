liquidity and capital resources historical cash flow we have generated and expect to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations 
when we were part of dean foods  our cash was swept regularly by dean foods 
dean foods also funded our operating and investing activities as needed 
the company s transfers of cash  both to and from dean foods cash management system  are reflected in the consolidated financial statements as parent s net investment 
dean foods did not allocate the interest expense related to its receivables backed facility or other financing obligations to its segments  except for specific borrowings for industrial revenue bonds 
therefore  the interest expense reflected in the consolidated financial statements relates to capital leases  senior notes and the line of credit for those periods 
year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in continuing operations operating activities investing activities financing activities 
table of contents net cash provided by continuing operating activities increased by million in compared to  due to an increase in net income  excluding one time items such as impairment charges and post retirement benefit obligation curtailment of million  a decrease in receivables in existing operations of million compared to an increase of million in  due to improved receivable management in of our acquisitions  and a million smaller increase in accounts payable  as the effect of accounts payable management begins to decrease 
net cash used in continuing investing activities was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  due primarily to the acquisitions of degraffenreid  san antonio farms and ed smith 
we received thousand  as the result of stock option exercises in compared to million in and paid million in financing costs related to our million revolving line of credit 

table of contents current debt obligations at december   we had million in borrowings under our revolving credit agreement  senior notes of million and million consisting of capital leases and other obligations 
our short term financing needs are primarily for financing working capital during the year 
due to the seasonality of pickle production driven by the cucumber harvest cycle  which occurs primarily during the spring and summer  pickle inventories generally are at a low point in late spring and at a high point during the fall increasing our working capital requirement 
in addition  we build inventories of soup in the summer months in anticipation of large seasonal shipments that begin late in the third quarter 
our long term financing needs will depend largely on potential acquisition activity 
at december   we had million in borrowings under our million revolving credit facility 
in addition  at december   there were million in letters of credit under the revolver that were issued but undrawn 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit agreements 
our existing credit agreement plus cash flow from operations  is expected to be adequate to provide liquidity for our planned growth strategy

payments required under long term capitalized lease contracts 
primarily represents commitments to purchase minimum quantities of raw materials used in our production processes 
we enter into these contracts from time to time in an effort to ensure a sufficient supply of raw ingredients 
in addition  we have contractual obligations to purchase various services that are part of our production process 
in accordance with gaap  these obligations are not reflected in the accompanying balance sheets 
operating lease obligations consist of minimum rental payments under non cancelable operating leases 
the fin liability recorded by the company is million at december   of which is expected to be settled within to years 
the remaining or million has been excluded from the table 
the timing of cash settlement for this portion  if any  cannot be reasonably estimated due to offsetting positions and conclusions upon audit 
the company s gross unrealized tax benefit is approximately million 
the difference between the gross unrealized tax benefit and the fin liability is due to the inclusion of corollary positions  interest  penalties  as well as the impact of state taxes on the federal tax liability which are included in the computation of the fin liability but not the gross unrecognized tax benefit 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any obligations that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement  other than operating leases  which have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
long term liabilities certain employees participate in retirement plans and postretirement plans 
these plans offer pension benefits through various defined benefit pension plans and also offer certain health care and life insurance benefits to eligible employees and their eligible dependents upon the retirement of such employees 
reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits and other postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors  assumptions and estimates 
for example  these costs are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods  the level of contributions made to the plan and earnings on plan assets 
our pension plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
changes made to the provisions of the plan may impact current and future pension costs 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns  as well as changes in general interest rates  may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
pension costs may be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension costs 
as such  significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants 
we contributed million to the pension plans and approximately million to the postretirement health plans in we expect to contribute approximately million to our pension plans in revolving credit facility on august   the company entered into amendment no 
to our unsecured revolving credit agreement  as amended the credit agreement  dated june   with a group of participating financial institutions 
among other things  amendment no 
reduces the available liquidity requirement with respect to permitted acquisitions and reduces the required consolidated interest coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter 
the company also exercised its option under the credit agreement to increase the aggregate commitments under the revolving credit facility from million to million 
the credit agreement also provides for a million letter of credit sublimit  against which million in letters of credit have been issued but undrawn 
proceeds from the credit facility may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes  including acquisition financing 
the credit facility contains various financial and other restrictive covenants and requires that we maintain certain financial ratios  including a leverage and interest coverage ratio 
we are in compliance with all applicable covenants as of december  we believe that  given our cash flow from operating activities and our available credit capacity  we can comply with the current terms of the credit facility and meet foreseeable financial requirements 
on september   we completed a private placement of million in aggregate principal of senior notes due september  pursuant to a note purchase agreement among treehouse and a group of purchasers 
all of the company s obligations under the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by bay valley foods  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the senior notes have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended  and may not be offered or sold in the united states absent registration or an applicable exemption 
net proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit agreement 
other commitments and contingencies we also have the following commitments and contingent liabilities  in addition to contingent liabilities related to ordinary course litigation  investigations and tax audits certain lease obligations  and selected levels of property and casualty risks  primarily related to employee health care  workers compensation claims and 
other casualty losses 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for more information about our commitments and contingent obligations 

table of contents future capital requirements capital expenditures were million in compared to million in we expect capital spending programs to increase in  as a result of including a full twelve months of the acquisitions in capital spending in will focus on productivity improvements and routine equipment upgrades or replacements at our plants  which number across the united states and canada 
known trends and uncertainties prices of raw materials we were adversely affected by rising input costs during and  and we expect our financial results to continue to be adversely affected by high input costs throughout many of the raw materials used in our products rose to unusually high levels during  including processed vegetables and meats  soybean oil  casein  cheese and packaging materials 
fluctuating fuel costs are also impacting our results 
prices for many of these raw materials and packaging materials are expected to remain high 
we manage the impact wherever possible by locking in prices on quantities required to meet our production requirements 
in addition  we offset the effect by raising prices to our customers 
however  for competitive reasons  we may not be able to pass along the full effect of increases in raw materials and other input costs as we incur them 
competitive environment there has been significant consolidation in the retail grocery and foodservice industries in recent years  and mass merchandisers are gaining market share 
as our customer base continues to consolidate  we expect competition to intensify as we compete for the business of fewer  large customers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep our existing customers  or gain new customers 
as the consolidation of the retail grocery and foodservice industries continues  we could lose sales if any one or more of our existing customers were to be sold 
both the difficult economic environment and the increased competitive environment at the retail and foodservice levels have caused competition to become increasingly intense in our business 
we expect this trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
in many cases the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles with no need for the application of our judgment 
in certain circumstances  however  the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to use our judgment to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reporting period 
we have identified the policies described below as our critical accounting policies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies 
accounts receivable we provide credit terms to customers generally ranging up to days  perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for estimated credit losses 
as these factors change  our estimates change and we could accrue different amounts for doubtful accounts in different accounting periods 
at december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million  or approximately of the accounts receivable balance 
we also maintain an allowance for customer promotional programs  marketing co op programs and other sales and marketing expenses 
this allowance is based on historical rolling twelve month average program activity and can fluctuate due to the level of sales and marketing programs 
this allowance was million and million  at december  and  respectively 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets totaled million as of december   resulting primarily from acquisitions 
upon acquisition  the purchase price is first allocated to identifiable assets and liabilities  including trademarks and customer related intangible assets  with any remaining purchase price recorded as goodwill 
goodwill and trademarks with indefinite lives are not amortized 

table of contents we believe that a trademark has an indefinite life if it has sufficient market share and a history of strong sales and cash flow performance that we expect to continue for the foreseeable future 
if these perpetual trademark criteria are not met  the trademarks are amortized over their expected useful lives 
determining the expected life of a trademark requires considerable management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors including the competitive environment  market share  trademark history and anticipated future trademark support 
indefinite lived trademarks and goodwill are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently  if other events occur  to ensure that fair value continues to exceed the related book value 
an indefinite lived trademark is impaired  if its book value exceeds fair value 
goodwill is impaired  if the book value of its reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
a reporting unit can be a segment or an operating division 
if the fair value of an evaluated asset is less than its book value  the asset is written down to fair value  which is generally based on its discounted future cash flows 
future business results could impact the evaluation of our goodwill and intangible assets 
amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating environment 
if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value  which is generally based on discounted future cash flows 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
assumptions used in our impairment evaluations  such as forecasted growth rates and our cost of capital  are consistent with our internal projections and operating plans 
we recognized impairment expenses for trademarks and other intangibles of million  for the year ending december  we had no impairments in purchase price allocation we allocate the cost of acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
all identifiable assets acquired  including identifiable intangibles  and liabilities assumed are assigned a portion of the cost of the acquired company  normally equal to their fair values at the date of acquisition 
the excess of the cost of the acquired company  over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired  less liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill 
we record the initial purchase price allocation based on evaluation of information and estimates available at the date of the financial statements 
as final information regarding fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined  appropriate adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation 
to the extent that such adjustments indicate that the fair values of assets and liabilities differ from their preliminary purchase price allocations  such differences would adjust the amounts allocated to those assets and liabilities and would change the amounts allocated to goodwill 
the final purchase price allocation includes the consideration of a number of factors to determine the fair value of individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including quoted market prices  forecast of expected cash flows  net realizable values  estimates of the present value of required payments and determination of remaining useful lives 
income taxes deferred taxes are recognized for future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we periodically estimate our probable tax obligations using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretations of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
these judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits and changes to or further interpretations of regulations 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that our tax rate may increase or decrease in any period  which could have an impact on our earnings 
future business results may affect deferred tax liabilities or the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
stock based compensation for the quarter beginning july   we adopted the requirements of sfas r  share based payments 
the company elected to use the modified prospective application of sfas r for these awards issued prior to july  income from continuing operations before income taxes  for the years ended december  and december   included share based compensation expense for employee and director stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units of million and million  respectively 

table of contents the fair value of each stock option  restricted stock and restricted stock unit award the awards is estimated on the date of grant 
the stock options were valued using a black scholes model and the restricted stock and restricted stock units were valued using a monte carlo simulation 
because valuation models incorporate ranges of assumptions for inputs  those ranges are disclosed 
share based compensation expense  as calculated and recorded under sfas no 
r  could have been impacted  if other assumptions were used 
furthermore  if we use different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be impacted in future periods 
as the company s stock was not publicly traded prior to june   expected volatilities are based on the implied historical volatilities from peer companies and other factors 
the company has estimated that all employees will complete the required service conditions associated with the restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards 
the expected service period is the longer of the derived service period  as determined from the output of the valuation models  and the implied service period based on the term of the awards 
the risk free interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the awards is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
the assumptions used to calculate the option and restricted stock awards granted in and the restricted stock unit awards in are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
insurance accruals we retain selected levels of property and casualty risks  primarily related to employee health care  workers compensation claims and other casualty losses 
many of these potential losses are covered under conventional insurance programs with third party carriers having high deductible limits 
in other areas  we are self insured with stop loss coverage 
accrued liabilities for incurred but not reported losses related to these retained risks are calculated based upon loss development factors which contemplate a number of variables  including claims history and expected trends 
these loss development factors are based on industry factors and  along with the estimated liabilities  are developed by us in consultation with external insurance brokers and actuaries 
at december  and  we recorded accrued liabilities related to these retained risks of million and million  respectively  including both current and long term liabilities 
changes in loss development factors  claims history and cost trends could result in substantially different results in the future 
employee benefit plan costs we provide a range of benefits to our employees  including pension and postretirement benefits to our eligible employees and retirees 
we record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by generally accepted accounting principles  which include various actuarial assumptions  such as discount rates  assumed investment rates of return  compensation increases  employee turnover rates and health care cost trend rates 
we review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends  when it is deemed appropriate 
as required by generally accepted accounting principles  the effect of the modifications is generally recorded and amortized over future periods 
different assumptions that we make could result in the recognition of different amounts of expense over different periods of time 
in  we retained investment consultants to assist our investment committee with the transition of plan assets to a master trust and to help our investment committee formulate a long term investment policy for the newly established master trust 
our current asset mix guidelines  under the investment policy  target equities at to of the portfolio and fixed income at to 
at december   our master trust was invested as follows equity securities of  fixed income securities of  and cash and cash equivalents of 
we determine our expected long term rate of return based on our expectations of future returns for the pension plan s investments based on target allocations of the pension plan s investments 
additionally  we consider the weighted average return of a capital markets model that was developed by the plan s investment consultants and historical returns on comparable equity  debt and other investments 
the resulting weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets is while a number of the key assumptions related to our qualified pension plans are long term in nature  including assumed investment rates of return  compensation increases  employee turnover rates and mortality rates  generally accepted accounting principles require that our discount rate assumption be more heavily weighted to current market conditions 
as such  our discount rate will likely change more frequently 
we used a discount rate to determine our estimated future benefit obligations of  at december  a reduction in the assumed rate of return on plan assets or a reduction in the discount rate would increase our annual pension expense by less than  in either case 
in addition  a increase in assumed healthcare costs trends would increase the aggregate annual postretirement medical expense by approximately recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate fluctuations in july  we entered into a forward interest rate swap transaction for a notational amount of million as a hedge of the forecasted private placement of million in senior notes 
the interest rate swap transaction was terminated on august   which resulted in a pre tax loss of million 
the unamortized loss is reflected  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
the total loss will be reclassified ratably to the consolidated statements of income as an increase to interest expense over the term of the senior notes  providing an effective interest rate of over the terms of the senior notes 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes or hold any derivative financial instruments  as of december   which could expose us to significant market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase in the amount of interest expense we expect to pay with respect to our revolving credit facility  which is tied to variable market rates 
based on our outstanding debt balance under our revolving credit facility  as of december   each rise in our interest rate would increase our interest expense by approximately million annually 
input costs the costs of other raw materials  as well as packaging materials and fuel  have varied widely in recent years and future changes in such costs may cause our results of operations and our operating margins to fluctuate significantly 
many of the raw materials that we use in our products rose to unusually high levels during  including processed vegetables and meats  soybean oil  casein  cheese and packaging materials 
in addition  fuel costs  which represent the most important factor affecting utility costs at our production facilities and our transportation costs  are currently at very high levels 
furthermore  certain input requirements  such as glass used in packaging  are available only from a limited number of suppliers 
the most important raw material used in our pickle operations is cucumbers 
we purchase cucumbers under seasonal grower contracts with a variety of growers strategically located to supply our production facilities 
bad weather or disease in a particular growing area can damage or destroy the crop in that area  which would impair crop yields 
if we are not able to buy cucumbers from local suppliers  we would likely either purchase cucumbers from foreign sources  such as mexico or india  or ship cucumbers from other growing areas in the united states  thereby increasing our production costs 
changes in the prices of our products may lag behind changes in the costs of our materials 
competitive pressures also may limit our ability to quickly raise prices in response to increased raw materials  packaging and fuel costs 
accordingly  if we are unable to increase our prices to offset increasing raw material  packaging and fuel costs  our operating profits and margins could be materially adversely affected
