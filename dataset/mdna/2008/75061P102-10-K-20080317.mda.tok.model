overview we are a leader in delivering innovative sensor solutions to serve industrial  energy  environmental and government safety markets worldwide 
in addition  we offer a full line of portable single sensor chemical and radiation detection products 
the market for our products has evolved from being strictly focused on environmental and industrial monitoring to now encompassing public safety 
we have expanded our presence to include the broader global energy exploration and refining safety equipment market and with the formation of rae fushun  we are serving the coal mine safety equipment market in china and oil production safety world wide 
in  we leveraged our expertise and experience to make two investments in china to pursue opportunities in one of the world s largest and fastest growing economies 
first in july  we increased our ownership in rae beijing to percent to benefit from our efforts to drive higher revenue and operating profit 
rae beijing produces  sells and distributes safety and security solutions for the chemical  oil  gas metals and energy sectors in china 
second  in december  we formed rae fushun  a joint venture to capitalize on china s growing reliance on coal based energy resources 
rae fushun manufactures and sells coal mine safety equipment 
rae systems owns percent of the joint venture which combines our skills and expertise with fushun anyi  a former state owned company serving the coal mine safety market 
the arearae has been deployed for continuous monitoring of worker safety in the petrochemical industry during plant turnarounds 
we believe arearae provides a significant cost savings and productivity advantage for bringing facilities back on line more quickly 
national guard civil support teams have deployed over fifty seven arearae wireless network systems at least one system for each state 
several chemical manufacturers  throughout europe  have selected the minirae and ppbrae plus pid instruments for industrial hygiene applications 
in china  petrochina  dushanzi has selected the raeguard fixed sensor systems 
we have received orders from several state operated oil fields including da gang  liao he  and the chang qing

we continued to augment our sales model with the introduction of a value added distributor program  additional regional sales management and inside sales resources 
we offer our channel partners a web portal to facilitate sale orders 
we are expanding our training programs to offer product and service training  and american industrial hygiene certification classes 
in india and the middle east we have added additional regional sales managers to grow our presence in these two emerging markets 
in china  our focus is on the growing environmental protection market and the industrial sector  including oil and gas  petro chemicals  certain telecom applications and coal mining 
a major priority will be to introduce new products for the coal mine safety market through rae fushun 
we believe this market will provide us a number of exciting new business opportunities in and beyond  as china continues to modernize its coal mining industry 
in all of our markets we will continue to explore and develop strategic value added partnerships  to leverage our product and market expertise 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  investments  valuation of deferred tax assets  restructuring costs  contingencies  inventory valuation  warranty accrual and stock based compensation expense 
in conjunction with acquisitions  we allocate investment costs based on the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments or estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
a provision for estimated product returns is established at the time of sale based upon historical return rates adjusted for current economic conditions 
historically  we have experienced an insignificant amount of sales returns 
we generally recognizes revenue when goods are shipped to our distributors in accordance with standard contract terms that pass title of all goods upon delivery to a common carrier fob factory and provides for sales returns under standard product warranty provisions 
for non standard contract terms where title to goods pass at time of delivery fob destination  revenue is recognized after we have established proof of delivery 
revenues relating to services performed under our extended warranty program represent less than of net revenues in each of  and and are recognized as earned based upon contract terms  generally ratable over the term of service 
we record project installation work in asia using the percentage of completion method 
installation revenue represents less than of net revenue in  and net revenues include amounts billed to customers in sales transactions for shipping and handling  as prescribed by the emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
shipping fees represent less than of net revenues in each of  and shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold 
accounts receivable  trade notes receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we grant credit to its customers after undertaking an investigation of credit risk for all significant amounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for estimated credit losses at a level deemed appropriate to adequately 
table of contents provide for known and inherent risks related to such amounts 
the allowance is based on reviews of loss  adjustments history  current economic conditions and other factors that deserve recognition in estimating potential losses 
we generally do not require collateral for sales on credit 
while management uses the best information available in making our determination  the ultimate recovery of recorded accounts receivable is also dependent upon future economic and other conditions that may be beyond management s control 
if there was a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or if actual defaults were higher than what have been experienced historically  additional allowances would be required 
we are not able to predict changes in the financial stability of our customers 
any material change in the financial status of any one or a group of customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
trade notes receivables are presented to us from some of our customers in china as a payment against the outstanding trade receivables 
these notes receivables are bank guarantee promissory notes which are non interest bearing and generally mature within months 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out method  or market 
we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage  or saleable only for amounts that are less than their carrying amounts 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in the market  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
we have established inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
when recorded  reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of the inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual demand for specified products deteriorates  or market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional reserves may be required 
goodwill we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time if events occur or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the goodwill to the carry value according to sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
since we operate as a single business segment under sfas no 
 segment reporting sfas  we are treated s a single reporting unit under sfas for the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment 
the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary involves significant judgment based on the short term and long term projections of the future performance of the company 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows of the company  including discount rate used and estimated terminal value reflect our best estimates 
long lived assets we test long lived asset groups for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
recoverability is assessed based on the carrying amounts of the asset and its fair value which is generally determined based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and the eventual disposal of the asset  as well as specific appraisals in certain instances 
an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds fair value 
stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for the recognition of stock based compensation cost in its statement of operations 
the fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of the grant using the black scholes merton valuation method 
this fair value was amortized 
table of contents as compensation expense  on a straight line basis  over the requisite service periods of the awards  which was generally the vesting period 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  where the fair value of each option is adjusted to reflect only those shares that are expected to vest 
our implementation of sfas r used the modified prospective transition method where the compensation cost related to each unvested option as of january   was recalculated and any necessary adjustment was reported in the first quarter of adoption 
we made the following estimates and assumptions in determining fair value valuation and amortization method we estimates the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton option pricing formula and a single option award approach 
this fair value is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period 
expected term our expected term represents the weighted average period that our stock based awards are expected to be outstanding 
prior to  we applied the simplified method as defined in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
from the first quarter of  we have used the historical exercise patterns of previously granted options in relation to the company s stock price to estimate expected exercise patterns as we expected that the simplified method would be disallowed by december  expected volatility the company s expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company s stock  adjusted where determined by management for unusual and non representative stock price activity not expected to recur 
expected dividend the black scholes merton valuation model calls for a single expected dividend yield as an input 
the company currently pays no dividends and does not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
risk free interest rate the company bases the risk free interest rate on the implied yield currently available on united states treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term 
estimated forfeitures to estimate forfeitures  we apply our historical rate of option forfeitures 
estimated forfeiture rates are trued up to actual forfeiture results as the stock based awards vest 
business combinations in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from customer contracts  acquired developed technologies and pending patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 

table of contents income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate primarily due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates  foreign losses not benefited  stock compensation expenses under sfas r which are not deductible for tax purposes and valuation allowance 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  accounting principles  or interpretations thereof 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
effective january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which requires a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the company records a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured pursuant to fin and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on its tax return 
to the extent that the company s assessment of such tax positions changes  the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
with the adoption of fin  the company also began reporting tax related interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense 
results of operations net sales percentage percentage change change change change in thousands net sales net sales for increased million or from million in the increase was primarily the result of an increase in net sales of million from the acquisition of rae fushun in december and an increase in net sales of million in the americas  million in europe and million in the rest of asia excluding fushun 
the increase in revenue was primarily due to overall greater market penetration by the sales team  which led to higher government orders in the united states and larger sales to oil and steel industries in china 
net sales for increased million or from million in the increase was primarily the result of increases in net sales in asia of million and europe of million partially offset by a decrease in the americas of million 
the increase in asia was due to higher sales of third party products  rae gas detector product sales and increased installation revenue

cost of sales in increased million or from million in gross profit in decreased less than million from million in however  the gross margin decreased to in compared with in the lower gross margin in was primarily due to a shift in sales in the americas towards lower margin portable products  an increase in the united states manufacturing overhead associated with facility cost and more competitive product pricing pressure in the united states 
in addition  lower gross margin installation revenue and third party product sales in asia contributed to the year over year decline in gross margin 
sales and marketing expense percentage percentage change change change change in thousands sales and marketing percentage of net sales sales and marketing expenses in increased million or from million in the increase was primarily due to a million increase in payroll and benefit related expenses  as a result of headcount increases in all regions and headcount increases from the acquisition of rae fushun in december  as well as million of increased travel and entertainment expenses and million of increased office and facility expenses

project expenses increased by million mainly due to increases in product certifications and testing expenses and additional projects from the formation of rae fushun as well as new projects related to future products in other regions 
we also impaired certain patents of approximately million in china as related products had reached end of life and were discontinued 

table of contents research and development expenses in increased million or from million in the increased expenses were primarily the result of increased headcount and project expenses for the development of new portable and wireless products at our engineering center in shanghai  china 
key product releases during included the gammarae systems ii r portable radiation detector and dosimeter as well as the neutron rae ii  a combined gamma and neutron radiation detector

in march  we revised the estimated loss on abandonment of the lease related to our former headquarters in sunnyvale  california and reduced operating expenses by million

during the second quarter of  a sublease was executed with rents commencing in june 
loss on abandonment of lease of approximately million in was associated with our abandonment of our former headquarters and manufacturing lease site in sunnyvale  california

we currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from anticipated net operating losses and other deductible temporary differences  which will reduce taxable income in future periods 
we established a full valuation allowance for our remaining deferred tax assets and recognized a million charge during the fourth quarter of we previously provided valuation allowances only for future tax benefits resulting from certain foreign net operating losses 
we believed it was more likely than not that the remaining net deferred tax assets would be realized principally based upon anticipated continued revenue growth and profitable results for this expectation was based on a number of factors  including the introduction of several new products in and  growing revenue in each of the geographic markets we serve and continued management focus on controlling operating expenses 
we believed that the combination of these factors would result in future profitable operations and the realization that the deferred tax assets would be fully utilized 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  requires a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized and that it is difficult to conclude that a valuation allowance is not needed when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
therefore  cumulative losses weighed heavily in the overall assessment 
we believe that sufficient uncertainty exists with regard to the realizability of these tax assets such that a valuation allowance is necessary 
factors considered in providing a valuation allowance include the lack of a significant history of consistent profits  the current and believed to be continued weakness in the overall market thereby potentially impacting our ability to sustain or grow revenues and earnings  and the length of carryback and carryforward periods 
we considered expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax 
table of contents planning strategies 
based on the absence of sufficient positive objective verifiable evidence at december   we increased our total valuation allowance on deferred tax assets to approximately million resulting in the million charge 
we expect to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until we can sustain an appropriate level of profitability and until such time  we would not expect to recognize any significant tax benefits in our future results of operations 
income tax benefit increased million or from million in our effective tax rate was a tax benefit in and tax benefit in the tax rate for and differed from the united states statutory rate due to foreign earnings taxed at lower rates  foreign losses not benefited  non deductible stock compensation deductions under sfas and sfas r and adjustments to our reserves for uncertain tax positions

additionally  we reported  for the release of tax reserves and related interest upon the expiration of the statute of limitations for federal tax liabilities applicable to uncertain tax positions for the year ended december  in  the tax authority in denmark  skat  has completed the audit of our subsidiary in denmark for the year ended december  without any adjustment 
minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiaries percentage percentage change change change change in thousands minority interest in income loss of consolidated subsidiaries minority interest in income of consolidated entities for increased  or from a loss of  in the increase in minority interest income of consolidated entities was mainly due to improved profitability at rae beijing  as well as increase in ownership from to in second half of fiscal the increase was partially offset by the loss generated by rae fushun  formed in december and less profit from rae france in minority interest in loss of consolidated entities for decreased  or from  in minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiaries represented net loss allocated to minority shareholders interest in rae beijing and majority shareholders interest in rae france 
the reduction in minority interest in loss of consolidated entities was due to improved profitability at rae beijing and rae france 
partially offsetting that reduction was the decrease in minority ownership that resulted from our increase in ownership of rae beijing from to in july loss from discontinued operations on august   the board of directors approved the discontinuation of our mobile dvr business in order to reduce expenses and concentrate resources on our gas and radiation detection business 
our mobile dvr business was acquired through the purchases of aegison and securay 
see note mergers and acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements for details 
on august   we notified our dvr customers  terminated all personnel not reassigned to continuing operations and suspended the related production and sales activities 
because the dvr business operates at a substantial loss  management intends to liquidate the tangible assets  mainly inventories of component parts 
accordingly  the value of these assets has been adjusted to reflect the anticipated disposals 
as a result of discontinuing the dvr business  management impaired the remaining value of the intangible assets and goodwill acquired in the purchases of aegison in july and securay in january impairment expense recognized in fiscal totaled million 

table of contents in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  the financial results of the dvr business are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the financial results included in discontinued operations were as follows percentage change change in thousands loss from discontinued operations before income taxes income tax benefit loss from discontinued operations liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations primarily through revenues from operations  proceeds from the issuance of equity securities and bank borrowings

on december  we had million in working capital current assets less current liabilities and a current ratio ratio of current assets to current liabilities of to compared to working capital of million and a current ratio of to on december  on march   we signed a million revolving credit agreement  which is available to help fund future growth and expansion 
the agreement provided for borrowings up to million based on a blanket security interest in our assets 
an additional million of borrowing is available based on a percentage of qualifying assets 
in addition to the on going requirement to submit quarterly financial statements  we are required to comply with certain reporting requirements whenever borrowings against the line of credit exceeds million 
there was an amendment to the revolving credit agreement in december  subsequent to the sale and leaseback of the san jose office building 
the million revolving credit agreement continued to be divided into two components 
the first million of borrowing previously based on a blanket security interest was changed to million and the million previously based qualifying assets was changed to million 
all other key terms and conditions remained essentially unchanged 
we are in full compliance with all of the borrowing requirements  including certain financial covenants  and as such  have the full line available 
at present  there are no outstanding amounts under the line of credit agreement  which expires in june we also have two unsecure lines of credit for renminbi million or approximately million and renminbi million or approximately million to provide working capital in china as of december  we believe our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents  together with cash generated from product sales  will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict  including the size  timing and structure of any future acquisitions  future capital investments  and future results of operations 
any future financing we may require may be unavailable on favorable terms  if at all 
any difficulty in obtaining additional financial resources could force us to curtail our operations or could prevent us from pursuing our growth strategy 
any future funding may dilute the ownership of our stockholders

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk concentration of credit risk currently  we have cash and cash equivalents deposited with major financial institutions in the countries where we conduct business 
our deposits may exceed the amount of insurance available to cover such deposits 
to date  we have not experienced any losses of deposits of cash and cash equivalents 
management regularly reviews our deposit amounts and the credit worthiness of the financial institution which hold our deposits 
interest rate risk as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
changes to interest rates over time may reduce or increase our interest income from our short term investments but the impact on our cash and cash equivalents is expected to be insignificant 

table of contents foreign currency exchange rate risk for the year ended december   a substantial portion of our recognized revenue was denominated in us dollars generated primarily from customers in the americas 
revenue generated from our european operations was primarily in euros  revenue generated by our asia operations was primarily in the renminbi rmb 
we manufacture a majority of our component parts at our manufacturing facility in shanghai  china 
since january  our operations in china have been affected by currency fluctuations due to an approximate appreciation of the rmb relative to the us dollar 
our strategy has been and will continue to be to increase our overseas manufacturing and research and development activities to capitalize on lower cost capacity and efficiencies in supply chain management 
in and  we made a strategic investment in china with the acquisition of a interest in rae bejing  a beijing based manufacturer and distributor of environmental safety and security equipment and the formation of rae fushun in late to capitalize on increase in demand for safety equipment in the mining and energy sectors in china 
there has been continued speculation in the financial press that china s currency  the rmb  will be subject to a further market adjustment relative to the us dollar and other currencies 
if  for example  there was a hypothetical change in the rmb relative to the us dollar  the effect on our profits would have been approximately million for fiscal if the currencies in all other countries in europe and asia where we have operations to change in unison with the rmb by a hypothetical against the us dollar  the approximate effect on our profits would be approximately million for fiscal the reduction in the impact of the rmb is due to the offset of changes in reported net sales in our other units resulting from changes in those countries local currencies 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars in countries other than china  any fluctuation in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could affect our competitive position in the international markets 
although we would continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and  when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot be certain that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future
