table of contents legislative and regulatory changes federal wto in  the country of antigua filed a formal complaint against the united states with the world trade organization wto  challenging the united states ability to enforce certain federal gaming laws sections  and of title of the united states code known as the wire act  the travel act and the illegal gambling business act  respectively  and collectively the acts against foreign companies that were accepting internet wagers from united states residents 
at issue was whether the united states enforcement of the acts against foreign companies violated the general agreement on trade in services gats 
in november  a wto panel ruled that the united states  as a signatory of gats  could not enforce the acts against foreign companies that were accepting internet wagers from united states residents 
the united states appealed the ruling and  in april  the wto s appellate body ruled that the united states had demonstrated that the acts were measures necessary to protect public morals or maintain public order  but that the united states did not enforce the acts consistently between domestic companies and foreign companies as required by gats 
the wto s appellate body specifically referenced the interstate horseracing act iha  which appeared to authorize domestic companies to accept internet wagers on horse racing  as being inconsistent with the united states stated policy against internet wagering 
in arguments and briefs before the wto s appellate body  the united states argued that the acts  specifically the wire act  apply equally to domestic companies and foreign companies and the iha does not create an exception for domestic companies to accept internet wagering on horse racing 
the wto s appellate body did not rule on whether an exception for domestic us companies was created under the iha  but recommended that the wto s dispute settlement body request the united states to bring measures found to be inconsistent with gats into conformity with its obligations under gats 
the united states was given until april  to bring its policies in line with the ruling  assuming it believed any changes were necessary 
on april   the united states delegation to the wto submitted a brief report to the chairman of the dispute settlement body us report stating that no changes are necessary to bring us policies in line with the ruling 
in support of its position  the united states delegation informed the dispute settlement body that on april   the united states department of justice confirmed the united states government position regarding remote wagering on horse racing in testimony before a subcommittee of the united states house of representatives 
according to the us report  in that testimony  the department of justice stated its view that regardless of the iha  existing criminal statutes prohibit the interstate transmission of bets or wagers  including wagers on horse racing  and informed the subcommittee that it is currently undertaking a civil investigation relating to a potential violation of law regarding this activity 
on january   the wto compliance panel issued its interim finding in response to the us report and found that the united states has failed to comply with previous wto rulings regarding restrictions on access to the us internet gaming market 
on march   the final report was issued upholding all lower panel decisions 
on may   the united states trade representative the ustr announced that it had initiated the formal process by the united states of withdrawing its gats commitment to clarify an error that it had made in by including gambling services in its schedule of commitments 
the ustr stated that the united states will use the wto procedures for clarifying its commitments under the gats 
the ustr also stated that the united states intends to modify its services schedule by clearly defining gambling as an excluded commitment under the gats 
the result of withdrawal would be that the united states would not be obligated to provide foreign providers of gambling services access to the united states market 
under gats  countries seeking to alter their service trade commitments must compensate trading partners that may potentially be negatively impacted by the change 
at this time  the only remaining issue before the wto appears to be appropriate compensation to affected members of the treaty 
the us government has made offers of compensation to wto members affected by the decision of the us to rule out any market access commitments regarding cross border gambling services 
in december  the wto arbitrators awarded antigua the right to impose sanctions against united states intellectual property  including copyrights  trademarks and patents  up to an annual amount of million 
the arbitrators award is not subject to appeal under wto rules 
the ustr has made no specific statement regarding how this will impact interstate gambling in horse racing 
one of the options available to congress and the white house is to prohibit or restrict substantially the conduct of interstate simulcast wagering or account wagering 
if the us government elects to take such an approach including through any action by the department of justice  it will have a material  adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents other federal legislation regulation on october   president bush signed into law the unlawful internet gambling enforcement act of uigea 
this act prohibits those involved in the business of betting or wagering from accepting any financial instrument  electronic or otherwise  for deposit that is intended to be utilized for unlawful internet gambling 
this act declares that nothing in the act may be construed to prohibit any activity allowed by the iha 
this act also contains a sense of congress  which explicitly states that it is not intended to criminalize any activity currently permitted by federal law 
the secretary of the treasury was directed to promulgate regulations to enforce the provisions of this act within days 
the secretary was further directed to ensure the regulations do not prohibit any activity which is excluded from the definition of unlawful internet gambling  including those activities legal under the iha 
on october   the treasury department published proposed rules and regulations that require us financial firms participating in designated payment systems to have policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent payments being made to gambling businesses in connection with unlawful internet gambling 
activities permitted under iha are specifically excluded from the definition of unlawful internet gambling 
comments on the proposed rules were filed by numerous parties through december  representatives of the horse racing industry encouraged regulations to mirror statutory languages protecting activities under the iha 
additionally  language was proposed requiring financial service providers to create a separate merchant code for activities under the iha 
florida on august   the district court of appeals  first district  state of florida rendered a decision in the case of floridians against expanded gambling faeg  et 
al versus floridians for a level playing field  et 
al 
faeg challenged the process by which signatures were collected in order to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot in allowing miami dade and broward county voters to approve slot machines in pari mutuel facilities 
the district court of appeals reversed a decision of the florida trial court  which granted summary judgment and dismissed the challenge  and remanded the case back to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether sufficient signatures were collected in the petition process 
a motion for rehearing by the entire court of appeals or in the alternative a motion for certification to the florida supreme court was filed 
the case was re heard by the entire court of appeals and the panel s decision was upheld 
the question of law has been certified to the florida supreme court  which initially accepted jurisdiction 
however  after oral arguments were made on september   the district court of appeals issued an opinion on september   which held the case was not properly put before the district court of appeals  and therefore upheld the lower court s decision to remand the case back to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing to determine whether sufficient signatures were collected in the petition process 
the case has not yet been scheduled for trial  and we are reviewing our legal options moving forward 
illinois pursuant to the illinois horse racing act  arlington park and all other illinois racetracks are permitted to receive a payment commonly known as purse recapture 
generally  in any year that wagering on illinois horse races at arlington park is less than of wagering both in illinois and at arlington park on illinois horse races in  arlington park is permitted to receive of the difference in wagering in the subsequent year 
the payment is funded from the arlington park purse account 
under the illinois horse racing act  the arlington park purse account is to be repaid via an appropriation by the illinois general assembly from the illinois general revenue fund 
however  this appropriation has not been made since subsequently  illinois horsemen unsuccessfully petitioned the illinois racing board irb to prevent illinois racetracks from receiving this payment in any year that the illinois general assembly did not appropriate the repayment to the racetrack s purse accounts from the general revenue fund 
further  the illinois horsemen filed lawsuits seeking  among other things  to block payment to illinois racetracks  as well as to recover the and amounts already paid to the illinois racetracks 
these lawsuits filed by the illinois horsemen challenging the and reimbursements have been resolved in favor of arlington park and the other illinois racetracks 
several bills were filed in the  and sessions of the illinois legislature that  in part  would eliminate the statutory right of arlington park and the other illinois racetracks to continue to receive this payment 
none of these bills passed 
since the statute remains in effect  arlington park continues to receive the recapture payment from the purse account 
if arlington park loses the statutory right to receive this payment  there would be a material  adverse impact on arlington park s results of operations 
under previously enacted legislation  the illinois horse racing equity fund was scheduled to receive a portion up to of adjusted gross receipts of wagering tax from the tenth riverboat casino license issued 
the grant of the tenth riverboat license is currently the subject of numerous legal and regulatory challenges and  as such  is currently not an operational riverboat license 
the funds were scheduled to be utilized for purses and track discretionary spending 
because the tenth license has never been operational  the illinois horse racing equity fund has never had any funds to distribute 

table of contents in the spring of session of the illinois general assembly  legislation was passed to create and fund the horse racing equity trust fund 
the horse racing equity trust fund is to be funded from revenues of illinois riverboat casinos that meet a certain threshold 
sixty percent of the funds are to be used for horsemen s purses for thoroughbred meets and for standardbred meets 
the remaining is to be distributed to racetracks of that total for arlington park and is for improving  maintaining  marketing and operating arlington park and may be used for backstretch services and capital improvements 
the legislation expires two years after its immediate effective date 
the governor of illinois signed the legislation on may  as public act in an effort to prevent implementation of public act  the four illinois riverboat casinos that meet the threshold to contribute to the horse racing equity trust fund filed a complaint on may  in the circuit court of will county  illinois 
the complaint was filed against the state treasurer and the irb to enjoin the imposition and collection of the surcharge from the casinos  which was to be deposited in the horse racing equity trust fund 
the court ruled in april that the law was unconstitutional as the law only affects the four suburban casinos and not the five downstate casinos 
the attorney general is filing an appeal of this ruling to the illinois supreme court 
the riverboats have been paying the monies into a special escrow account and have demanded that the monies not be distributed 
a temporary restraining order was granted to prevent distribution of these monies 
the complaint alleges that public act is unconstitutional 
the illinois attorney general is representing illinois on this matter  and the litigation is ongoing 
as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k  management does not know the impact that the ultimate outcome of this matter could have on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
arlington park will continue to seek authority to conduct gaming at the racetrack 
the session of the illinois legislature ended without enactment of legislation permitting expanded gaming at the racetrack 
legislation allowing slot machines at illinois racetracks and clarifying the legality of advance deposit wagering is expected to be introduced as part of a capital spending plan during at this point  it is too early to determine whether those initiatives will be successful 
during january  february and a portion of march when there is no live racing in illinois  the irb designates a thoroughbred racetrack as the host track in illinois  for which the host track receives a higher percentage of earnings from pari mutuel activity throughout illinois 
the irb appointed arlington park the host track in illinois during january for eighteen days  which is a decrease of twelve days compared to the same period of in addition  arlington park was appointed the host track for twenty nine days in february  which is an increase of fourteen days compared to the same period of also  arlington park was appointed the host track for two days in march  which is an increase of two days compared to the same period of arlington park s future designation as the host track is subject to the annual designation by the irb 
a change in the number of days that arlington park is designated host track could have a material  adverse impact on our results of operations 
kentucky the kentucky horse industry continues to seek legal authority to offer alternative forms of gaming at kentucky s eight existing racetracks 
alternative forms of gaming would enable our kentucky racetrack to better compete with neighboring gaming venues by providing substantial new revenues for purses and capital improvements 
kentucky s gubernatorial election was held on november   and the democratic candidate  steve beshear  publicly stated his support for limited gaming at racetracks and a few other select locations as a key revenue enhancement strategy for kentucky 
governor beshear unveiled his plan on february   which could permit churchill downs to operate a casino in jefferson county  kentucky 
under governor beshear s plan  which requires an amendment to the kentucky constitution seven racetracks and five stand alone facilities would be permitted the opportunity to operate a casino 
churchill downs would be required to pay a million license fee  an annual excise tax on adjusted gross receipts for five years and a excise tax on adjusted gross receipts thereafter 
purse supplements and industry incentives of on adjusted gross receipts would also be required 
the house standing committee on elections  constitutional amendments and intergovernmental affairs approved an alternative amendment that would permit up to nine casino locations in kentucky with no more than five at racetracks 
the amendment would not guarantee any specific location  and tax rates and license fees are not specified 
as of the date of the filing of this annual report on form k  it is too early to determine whether this legislation will be successful

the governor of indiana signed this legislation into law  and hoosier park officials have begun the construction of a new slot facility 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our historical experience  contract terms  observance of known trends in our company and the industry as a whole and information available from other outside sources 
our estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those initial estimates 
our most significant estimates relate to the valuation of plant and equipment  receivables  goodwill and other intangible assets  which may be significantly affected by changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate  and to the aggregate costs for self insured liability and workers compensation claims 
additionally  estimates are used for determining income tax liabilities and other derivative instruments 
we evaluate our goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets in accordance with the application of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for goodwill and intangible assets  we review the carrying values at least annually during the first quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
we assign estimated useful lives to our intangible assets based on the period of time the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows 
we consider certain factors when assigning useful lives such as legal  regulatory  competition and other economic factors 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight line method 
while we believe that our estimates of future revenues and cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions could materially affect our assessment of useful lives and fair values 
changes in assumptions may cause modifications to our estimates for amortization or impairment  thereby impacting our results of operations 
if the estimated lives of our intangible assets were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above  amortization expense could increase significantly 
our business can be impacted positively and negatively by legislative and regulatory changes and by gaming competition 
a significant negative impact from these activities could result in a significant impairment of our plant and equipment and or our goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
additional information regarding how our business can be impacted by competition and legislative changes is included in items i and j  respectively  in this annual report on form k 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no

 accounting for involuntary conversions of nonmonetary assets to monetary assets 
we also use estimates and judgments for financial reporting to determine our current tax liability  as well as those taxes deferred until future periods 
net deferred and accrued income taxes represent significant assets and liabilities of the company 
in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes as specified in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
adjustments to deferred taxes are determined based upon changes in differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities  measured by future tax rates we estimate will be applicable when these differences are expected to reverse 
changes in current tax laws  enacted tax rates or the estimated level of taxable income or non deductible expenses could change the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and affect the overall effective tax rate and tax provision 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable that we have deemed to have a high risk of uncollectibility 
we analyze historical collection trends and customer creditworthiness when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
any changes in our assumptions or estimates could impact our bad debt expense and results of operations 
in  our business insurance renewals included substantially the same coverage and retentions as in previous years 
we estimate insurance liabilities for workers compensation and general liability losses based on our historical loss experience  certain actuarial assumptions of loss development factors and current industry trends 
any changes in our assumptions  actuarial assumptions or loss experience could impact our total insurance cost and overall results of operations

these other revenues are primarily derived from statutory racing regulations in some of the states where our facilities are located and can fluctuate materially year to year 
gaming revenues are primarily generated from video poker and slot machines and are recognized when the related service is performed 
other operating revenues are primarily generated from admissions  sponsorships  licensing rights and broadcast fees  fees for alternative uses of our facilities  concessions  lease income  information sales and other sources 
pari mutuel revenues are recognized upon occurrence of the live race that is presented for wagering and after that live race is made official by the respective state s racing regulatory body

the first amendment to the amended and restated credit agreement dated september  the agreement 
the guarantors under the first amendment continue to be a majority of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries 
the first amendment primarily serves i to reduce the maximum aggregate commitment under the credit facility from million to million and ii to reduce the interest rates applicable to amounts borrowed under this facility 
given the reduction in the maximum aggregate commitment  four lenders that were originally parties to the agreement are removed as lenders under the terms of the first amendment 
the company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of million representing the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs related to its previous credit facility during the year ended december  all other major terms of the agreement remain the same including the facility termination date of september  subject to certain conditions  the company may at any time increase the aggregate commitment up to an amount not to exceed million 
generally  borrowings made pursuant to the first amendment will bear interest at a libor based rate per annum plus an applicable percentage ranging from to depending on certain of the company s financial ratios 
in addition  under the first amendment  the company agreed to pay a commitment fee at rates that range from to of the available aggregate commitment  depending on the company leverage ratio 
the first amendment contains customary financial and other covenant requirements  including specific interest coverage and leverage ratios  as well as minimum levels of net worth 
the first amendment adds a negative covenant that imposes a million cap on the amount of any investment that the company may make to construct a gaming and or slot machine facility in florida in the event that laws in the state permit and the company obtains authority to engage in such activities 
the first amendment also modifies two of the financial covenants  providing for a one time increase in the maximum leverage ratio for a period of eight consecutive quarters in the event that the company constructs a gaming and or slot facility in florida and increasing the baseline for the minimum consolidated net worth covenant from million to million 
we believe that cash flows from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements for the next year

the company will pay interest on the principal amount of the note on an annual basis in an amount equal to what the shareholder would have received as a dividend on the shares that were redeemed 
the note is immediately convertible  at the option of the shareholder  into shares of the company s common stock at a conversion price of 
the note may not be prepaid without the shareholder s consent 
upon maturity  the company must pay the principal balance and unpaid accrued interest in cash 
effective on the date of the amendment  the note was deemed a conventional convertible debt instrument 
as such  the note was adjusted to fair market value on march  against current earnings 
the long put option and short call option are included in other assets and other liabilities  respectively  and are both being amortized into earnings on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the note 
the company recorded unrealized gains on derivative instruments in the amount of million during each of the years ended december   and  respectively

 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
replaces multiple existing definitions of fair value with a single definition  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands financial statement disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies only to fair value measurements that already are required or permitted by other accounting standards and does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective in the first quarter of  and we do not expect the adoption will have a material impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations

r  business combinations sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  an entity is required to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  contractual contingencies  and contingent consideration at their fair value on the acquisition date 
it further requires that acquisition related costs be recognized separately from the acquisition and expensed as incurred  restructuring costs generally be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period impact income tax expense 
in addition  acquired in process research and development is capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized over its estimated useful life 
the adoption of sfas no 
r will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  which bears interest at libor based variable rates 
we are exposed to market risk on variable rate debt due to potential adverse changes in the libor rate 
assuming the outstanding balance of the debt facilities remain constant  a one percentage point increase in the libor rate would reduce annual pre tax earnings  recorded fair value and cash flows by million
