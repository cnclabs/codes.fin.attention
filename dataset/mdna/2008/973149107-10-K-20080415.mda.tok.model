we offer our customers a choice of leading real time  proprietary operating systems and open source based  commercial grade linux operating systems 
we also offer our comprehensive  eclipse based workbench software development suite that allows our customers to manage the design  development  debugging and testing of their device software systems  as well as leading device management solutions that allow our customers to remotely monitor and manage their devices in either lab or field environments 
our customers manufacture devices as varied as set top boxes  automobile braking and navigation systems  mobile handsets  internet routers  avionics control panels and coronary pacemakers 
our operating systems are currently deployed in millions of devices 
we market our products and services in north america  emea comprising europe  the middle east and africa  japan and the asia pacific region  primarily through our own direct sales organization  which consists of sales persons and field engineers 
we also license distributors  primarily in international regions  to serve customers in regions not serviced by our direct sales force 
we were incorporated in california in february and reincorporated in delaware in april our strategy our objectives are to strengthen our leadership position in the dso industry and to increase our revenue and profitability 
to achieve these objectives  we are pursuing the following strategic initiatives accelerating investments in targeted growth product areas we are focusing increased engineering  sales  and marketing resources in certain targeted growth product areas  including linux platforms  device management solutions  multiple independent levels of security mils solutions in the aerospace and defense industry and multiprocessing capabilities 
increasing profitability of established products we are refocusing our resources to generate increased returns from our more established products  including our vxworks solutions  our on chip debugging tools and our other general purpose development tools 
focusing operations at the beginning of our fiscal year  we reorganized our operations into four product divisions vxworks  linux  tools  and device management 
this realignment was designed to help us focus on new technology and market opportunities  to become more nimble and agile with our customers and partners and to drive and measure returns on our investments 
targeting growth vertical markets we are concentrating increased sales and marketing efforts in targeted growth vertical markets  including aerospace and defense especially mils  network equipment  mobile handsets  industrial  automotive infotainment  mobile internet devices and digital living 
during fiscal year  we had significant design wins in many of these markets and  in particular  in the mobile handset and automotive infotainment markets 
leveraging alliances with key partners we are continually seeking to establish relationships with key hardware and software partners in order to develop  promote and sell products and services to new customers or through new distribution channels 
we are also playing increasingly important roles in several industry consortia and standards setting bodies  particularly in the open source industry  in order to promote technology standardization and adoption 
how we earn our revenues we earn our revenues from the license and sale of our products and from providing services related to our products 
our software products are licensed to our customers for their development use under either a 
table of contents subscription license or a perpetual license 
customers who purchase a subscription license are charged per term  typically an annual fee  renewable at the election of the customer 
customers who purchase a perpetual license are generally charged a one time  up front fee 
once development is completed  whether under a subscription license or a perpetual license  we also generally charge our customers a production license fee for every copy of our proprietary software included in the final  manufactured device 
customers either report their usage on a quarterly basis or purchase a block of production licenses in advance of use 
we also earn revenue for support and maintenance services for our products  which includes telephone support and provision of updates 
for products licensed under a perpetual license  support and maintenance may be purchased for a separate fee 
for products licensed under a subscription license  support and maintenance is included in the per term fee  and includes upgrades 
in addition  we also charge customers for other services related to our products  such as training and professional services 
our training services are generally purchased for a fixed fee  while our professional services are available on both a time and materials and fixed price contract basis 
our professional services are designed to assist our customers with the design and development of a completed device or application and may include project managed custom hardware development  software development and product integration 
in fiscal  we will begin to offer our customers the option to purchase under a term license with maintenance model 
customers will be able to enter into renewable  limited term licenses with us  which will provide them with development rights to use wind river products for a limited term rather than on a perpetual basis 
these customers also can purchase support and maintenance for a separate fee on an annual  renewable basis  and which will also include the rights to receive upgrades in addition to updates 
we will also charge our customers a production license fee for every copy of our proprietary software included in the final  manufactured device 
our product revenues are comprised of revenues from perpetual and term license  the revenues that we receive for all production licenses  whether related to development under a perpetual license  term license or a subscription license  and hardware revenues 
our subscription revenues are derived from revenues from our subscription licenses  not related to production fees  and includes support and maintenance provided to these customers 
our services revenues are derived from our professional services revenues and training  as well as revenues for support and maintenance of our products under perpetual and term licenses

these metrics allow management to monitor the robustness and profitability of our business and to evaluate any necessary areas for investment or  in contrast  for improved efficiencies and effectiveness 

table of contents recent operating results during fiscal  we continued to grow revenue and deferred revenue while continuing to generate positive cash flows from operations 
growth in revenue and deferred revenue was primarily driven by an increase in our subscription licensing business 
our total revenues were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  an increase of million or 
in fiscal  our revenues increased by million or over revenues of million in fiscal our net loss was million or per diluted share in fiscal our net income in fiscal was  or per diluted share and our net income in fiscal was million  or per diluted share 
our total deferred revenue increased by to million at january  from million at january   and by at january  from million at january   primarily as a result of continued increases in sales of our subscription license products 
short term deferred revenues increased by to million at january  from million at january  of the total deferred revenue balance at january   million related to deferred revenue classified as long term 
we generated cash flows from operations of million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash provided by operating activities declined by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to slower growth in deferred revenue and increased operating expenses 
cash provided by operating activities increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  due primarily to growth in operating cash generated from increased deferred revenues 
during fiscal  we acquired sc comsys sc and the rtlinux business for an approximate net cash outlay of million and we repurchased  shares of our common stock for a total cash outlay of million 
we have experienced increased demand for our professional services as market and industry conditions change rapidly 
our revenue from other service revenues  which includes mostly professional services  was million in fiscal  representing approximately of our revenue 
the relative mix of professional services revenues to other revenues in any period can affect the amounts of our reported revenues  deferred revenues  operating margins and earnings 
for example  revenues from professional services engagements are generally recognized only when the contracted services are performed  causing revenues to be reported over time  professional services engagements typically generate smaller operating margins than earnings derived from licenses of our proprietary software solutions  reducing operating margins and earnings  and most of the contracted future revenue from services engagements is typically included in services backlog which is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheets rather than as deferred revenue 
our open source business  which at this point includes a larger professional services component than our proprietary software business  is becoming an increasingly important part of our strategy and our expected future results 
our open source business is growing while we have experienced at times slower growth in the proprietary component of our subscription business 
if our open source business does not grow as quickly as we anticipate or if we are not successful in licensing our open source solutions on profitable terms  our future financial performance may be materially adversely affected 
recent developments from march  to april   we repurchased million shares of our common stock for a total cost of million and an average price of per share 
as a result of these purchases  we completed our share repurchase program that was authorized in june in april  the board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program to enable us to purchase up to an aggregate of million in shares of wind river common stock in the open market or through 
table of contents negotiated transactions 
from april  to april   we repurchased  shares of our common stock under this new repurchase program for a total cost of million and an average price of per share 
on february   subsequent to the fiscal year end  we adopted a reorganization plan to better align our resources with our strategic business objectives 
as part of this plan  we intend to reduce our workforce by approximately to positions during the first quarter of fiscal we expect to incur total restructuring and other charges ranging from million to million in connection with this reorganization plan 
substantially all of the charges will relate to cash severance costs 
we recognized  of these costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to statutory and other predefined severance benefit plans 
we expect to incur a substantial majority of the remaining charges during the first quarter of fiscal year on february   we adopted the consensus reached in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for sabbatical leave and other similar benefits pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for compensated absences eitf 
eitf provides recognition guidance on the accrual of employees rights to compensated absences under a sabbatical or other similar benefit arrangement 
prior to the adoption of eitf  we recorded a liability for sabbatical leave upon employee vesting in the benefit  which occurred only at the end of a five year service period 
under eitf  we now accrue an estimated liability for sabbatical leave over the requisite five year service period  as employee services are rendered 
the adoption of eitf resulted in a million increase to accumulated deficit  accrued compensation and other long term liabilities as of february  on february   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the adoption of fin did not result in a material adjustment to accumulated deficit and decreased income taxes payable and other assets by  and  respectively  as of february  we continue to record interest and penalties accrued on unrecognized tax benefits as well as interest received from favorable settlements within provision for benefit from income taxes on the consolidated statement of operations 
see note  provision benefit for income taxes  in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further information 
acquisitions in august  we acquired all of the outstanding shares of sc comsys srl comsys  a privately held professional services company based in romania 
the acquisition will enable us to increase the number of skilled consultants in our professional services organization and to expand our service offerings throughout europe and globally 
we paid cash consideration of approximately million  comprised of million in cash consideration  plus acquisition related costs 
in addition  we agreed to pay comsys former shareholders a potential earn out distribution of up to  which will be payable and recognized as compensation expense if certain specified future performance criteria are met 
the purchase was recorded as asset acquisition as it did not qualify as a business combination under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
in february  we acquired the intellectual property  including patents  copyrights  trademarks and associated product rights for the rtlinux business from finite state machine labs  inc rtlinux is a commercially available  patented  hard real time linux technology 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we also acquired rights to future runtime revenue streams for assumed rtlinux contracts 
we paid cash consideration of approximately million  comprised of million in cash  plus acquisition related costs 
we accounted for this acquisition in accordance with sfas  and the effect of the acquisition was not material to our consolidated statement of operations  balance sheets  or cash flows 

table of contents during fiscal year  we subsequently recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to the carrying value of our intangible assets associated with the rtlinux business 
of this amount  million was included in amortization and impairment of purchased technologies and the remaining  was included in amortization and impairment of other intangibles 
the impairment resulted from a decline in the projected future cash flows of the rtlinux business as we changed the sales and marketing strategy for our rtlinux products 
see note  acquisitions  goodwill and purchased intangibles  in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these acquisitions and impairment charges 
critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or us gaap 
the application of us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
note  the company and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements describes our significant accounting policies which are reviewed by us on a regular basis and which are also reviewed by senior management with the audit committee of our board of directors 
an accounting policy is deemed by us to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
the policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to an understanding of our financial results and condition and that require a higher degree of judgment and complexity  are revenue recognition  estimating sales returns and other allowances  and allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangibles  valuation of investments  accounting for income taxes  and stock based compensation 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues from three sources product revenues  subscription revenues and service revenues  in each case  net of sales returns and other allowances 
product revenues consist of revenues from production licenses sometimes referred to as royalties  and fees for stand alone software and software programming tools sold under our perpetual licensing model and from sales of our hardware 
subscription revenues consist primarily of revenues from the licensing of products and services under our enterprise licensing model  including items such as development tools  an operating system  various protocols and interfaces and maintenance and training  which are licensed over a limited period of time  typically months 
service revenues are derived from fees from professional services  which include design and development fees  software maintenance contracts  and customer training and consulting 
agreements generally do not allow the right of return or sales price adjustments 
we present revenue net of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of operations

revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition sab 
we recognize revenues when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable and collection is determined to be probable 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we recognize revenue when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists for all undelivered elements of the arrangement or at the point when all elements have been delivered 
these criteria are further defined as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
it is our customary practice for arrangements other than a clickwrap agreement to have non cancelable contracts and generally a customer purchase order prior to recognizing revenues on an arrangement 
for products purchased under a clickwrap agreement it is generally our customary practice to have a customer purchase order prior to recognizing revenues 
delivery has occurred 
product revenues for software and hardware are recognized at the time of shipment or upon the delivery of a product master  with standard transfer terms of fob shipping point 
if undelivered products or services exist that are essential to the functionality of the delivered product in an arrangement  delivery is not considered to have occurred 
if only non essential products or services are undelivered and if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the recognition of fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
we recognize revenues from subscription based licenses ratably over the term of the agreement 
subscription agreements require that we deliver unspecified future updates and upgrades within the same product family during the subscription term 
accordingly  fees from these arrangements are recognized ratably over their term 
if an agreement includes a specified upgrade  all revenue that would have otherwise been recognized is deferred until the specified upgrade is delivered 
sales to original equipment manufacturers  system integrators and value added resellers are recognized at the time delivery has occurred for perpetual licenses and ratably over the related term for subscription licenses 
sales to distributors are generally recognized as noted above provided that we have evidence of an end user agreement 
professional service revenues are generally separately priced  are available from a number of suppliers  and are typically not essential to the functionality of our software products 
revenues from these services are recognized separately from the license fee if the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined by sop generally  revenue from time and materials consulting contracts are recognized as services are performed 
contract accounting is utilized for service revenues from fixed price contracts that require significant software modification  development or customization 
in such instances  the arrangement fee is accounted for in accordance with sop  whereby the arrangement fee is recognized  generally using the percentage of completion method measured on labor input costs 
if increases in projected costs to complete are sufficient to create a loss contract  the entire estimated loss is charged to operations in the period the loss first becomes known 
to date these losses have not been significant 
the complexity of the estimation process and judgments related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affect the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization  changes to specification and testing requirements and collectibility of unbilled receivables 
service revenues from software maintenance  support and update fees are recognized ratably over the contract period  which is typically months 
service revenues from training and consulting are recognized when the services are provided 

table of contents in the case where we execute more than one contract or agreement with a single customer we evaluate each to determine whether the separate contracts or agreements should be viewed as one multiple element arrangement 
where the determination of a multiple element arrangement is made  we recognize revenue only if sufficient vsoe exists to allocate revenue to the various elements of the arrangement or at the point when all elements have been delivered 
the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable 
at the time of each transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with a revenue transaction is fixed or determinable based on the payment and other terms associated with the transaction 
for product and subscription revenues  if a significant portion of a fee is due after our standard payment terms  which are generally no greater than days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  revenue is recognized as the fees become due subject to all other revenue recognition criteria being met 
collection is probable 
we assess probability of collection based on a number of factors  including our past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
new customers and certain existing customers are subject to a credit review process that evaluates each customer s financial position and ultimately its ability to pay according to the original terms of the arrangement 
based on our review process  if it is determined from the outset of an arrangement that collection of the resulting receivable is not probable  then revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis 
vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we establish vsoe for maintenance services by reference to substantive stated future renewal rates included in contracts or the amounts charged on similar transactions 
we establish vsoe for professional services time and materials contracts by reference to standard hourly rates separately charged for services 
we do not have vsoe for professional services fixed price contracts 
where such services are sold in conjunction with other products  significant management judgment is required to determine appropriate revenue recognition 
for consolidated statement of operations classification purposes only  we allocate revenue first to those elements for which we have established vsoe of fair value  and any remaining recognized revenue is then allocated to those items for which we lack vsoe of fair value 
if the elements for which we have no fair value include fixed price services  we allocate revenue to these services based upon expected hours to be incurred plus a normal margin 
any remaining revenues would be allocated to product or subscription revenues  depending on the type of license purchased 
significant management judgments and estimates are made in connection with the revenues recognized in any accounting period 
we must assess whether the fee associated with a revenue transaction is fixed or determinable  whether or not collection is probable  whether vsoe exists for all elements of a transaction or multiple element arrangement and the related revenue recognition impact of this and  for fixed price contracts  make estimates of costs to complete 
material differences could result in the amount and timing of revenues for any period if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates 
estimating sales returns and other allowances  and allowance for doubtful accounts we record estimated reductions in revenue for potential returns of products by customers and other allowances 
as a result  management must make estimates of potential future product returns and other allowances related to current period product revenue 
in making such estimates  management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products 
if management were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates  material differences in the amount of our reported revenue could result 
the provision for sales returns and other allowances was million and million at january  and  respectively 
the provision represents and as a percentage of net revenues  for fiscal years and  respectively 
similarly  management makes estimates of the non collectibility of accounts receivables  specifically analyzing accounts receivable and historical bad debts  geographic concentrations  customer credit worthiness  
table of contents current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms  when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition to the identification of individual specific doubtful accounts receivable  we provide allowances for other accounts receivable based on our historical experience

the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and million at january  and  respectively

see note  the company and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of activities during the years reported 
valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangibles goodwill and purchased intangibles 
intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions of entities accounted for using the purchase method of accounting are estimated by management based on the fair value of assets received 
these include acquired customer base  technological know how  trademarks and goodwill 
intangible assets  other than goodwill are amortized over the estimated useful lives ranging from one year to seven years on a straight line basis 
significant management judgment is involved in assessing the fair value of goodwill and purchased intangible assets received 
the primary methods used to determine the fair value of assets received is the income approach  under which we must make assumptions as to the future cash flows of the acquired entity or assets  the appropriate discount rate to use to present value the cash flows and the anticipated life of the acquired assets  and the market approach  under which we compare the value of our business unit to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
if we made different judgments  material differences in the amount of fair value assigned to purchased intangibles and goodwill could arise 
we review goodwill for impairment annually in the second quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
we currently operate as one segment and have one reporting unit 
the primary methods used to determine the fair value of goodwill for impairment purposes were the income and market approaches 
goodwill was million at january  and million at january  and purchased intangibles  net  were million and million at january  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets such as property and equipment and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas requires the recognition of the impairment of long lived assets when circumstances indicate an impairment has occurred and in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
accordingly  we evaluate asset recoverability when an event occurs that may impair recoverability of the asset 
we determine the recoverability of the carrying amount of each asset by reviewing the following factors the undiscounted value of expected operating cash flows in relation to its net capital investments  the estimated useful or contractual life of the asset  the contract or product supporting the asset 
in the case of purchased intangibles and capitalized software development costs  we periodically review the recoverability of the asset s value by evaluating its products with respect to technological advances  competitive products and the needs of its customers 
a significant portion of our long lived assets  including goodwill  is located in north america 
the assessment for any required impairment charge for goodwill  purchased intangibles and other long lived assets is based upon estimated discounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the goodwill  purchased intangibles or long lived assets using an appropriate discount rate that incorporates our cost of capital and the risk profile of the associated investment 
the assumptions supporting the cash flows  including the discount rates  are determined using our best estimates as of the date of the impairment review 
these estimates are highly subjective and require significant management judgment as these estimates require us to make assumptions regarding future operating results  which are inherently difficult to predict 
if these estimates or their related 
table of contents assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
in fiscal  we recognized an impairment charge of million related to purchased and other intangibles acquired as part of the acquisition of the rtlinux business in february valuation of investments we invest our excess operating cash in various marketable investments  including us government and agency debt securities  corporate debt securities and asset backed and other securities 
as of january  and  the aggregate fair value of our investment portfolio was million and million  respectively 
we account for our portfolio in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
accordingly  we determine the appropriate classification of debt and other securities at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
as of january  and  we classified all of our debt and other securities as available for sale 
such securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related tax effect  if any  are reported as a component of other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheet until realized 
realized gains and losses are determined based upon the specific identification method and are reflected as a component of other income expense  net on our consolidated statement of operations in the period of sale 
we regularly review our investments in unrealized loss positions for other than temporary impairments in accordance with fasb staff positions nos 
fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments the fsps 
the application of the fsps to securities in unrealized loss positions is complex and requires reliance on significant quantitative and qualitative assumptions and estimates regarding credit ratings  collateralization  the length of time and significance of the loss position and our intent and ability to hold to maturity or forecasted recovery 
unrealized losses on other than temporarily impaired securities are recognized in other income expense  net on the consolidated statement of operations in the period that we determine that an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
during fiscal  we determined that a certain asset backed security in our portfolio was other than temporarily impaired due to a deterioration in credit rating  an overall under collateralization and a significant non recoverable decline in fair value 
as a result  we recorded an other than temporary impairment loss of  related to this security 
as of january   we determined that no other securities in our investment portfolio were other than temporarily impaired 
accounting for income taxes significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  income tax liabilities  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
judgment is applied to estimate taxable income by jurisdiction and our ability to utilize any unexpired credits and or net operating losses 
we are subject to income tax audits in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate and  as a result  must also assess exposures to any potential issues arising from current or future audits of current and prior years tax returns 
accordingly  we must assess such potential exposure and  where necessary  provide a reserve to cover any expected loss in accordance with the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
to the extent that we establish a reserve  our provision for income taxes would be increased 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
in addition  for the year ended january   we realized benefits of approximately  arising from meeting certain recognition criteria relating to research and development tax credits as well as the expiration of the statute of limitation in a foreign jurisdiction 
during fiscal year and  we 
table of contents realized benefits of  and  respectively  arising from the final assessment of foreign tax audits 
no such tax benefits were recognized during fiscal our tax rate may also vary based on our results and the mix of income or loss amongst the domestic and foreign tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
deferred income taxes are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  and are determined based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using the tax rates and laws in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas provides for recognition of deferred tax assets if the realization of such assets is more likely than not to occur 
with the exception of primarily the us jurisdiction  we have determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred taxes will be realized 
accordingly  we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of million and million  related to certain international jurisdictions and a full valuation allowance against the remainder of our deferred tax assets at january  and  respectively 
should we determine that we would be able to realize our remaining deferred tax assets in the foreseeable future  an adjustment to our remaining deferred tax assets would cause a material increase to income in the period such determination is made 
significant management judgment is required in determining the period in which the reversal of a valuation allowance should occur 
we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  such as historical levels of income and future forecasts of taxable income amongst other items in determining whether a full or partial release of a valuation allowance was required 
in addition  our assessments sometimes require us to schedule future taxable income in accordance with sfas to assess the appropriateness of a valuation allowance  which further requires the exercise of significant management judgment 
following our analyses  in fiscal we did not release any additional valuation allowance and in fiscal  we released our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the united kingdom 
the release of the united kingdom valuation allowance caused an incremental tax benefit of million to be recognized in fiscal the valuation allowance at january  is million and relates primarily to deferred tax assets held in the us we will continue to evaluate the ability to realize  by jurisdiction  our deferred tax assets and related valuation allowances on a quarterly basis 
due to our recent profitability  we believe that it is at least reasonably possible that a material adjustment to the valuation allowance may occur within the near term 
stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r beginning february  accordingly  during the fiscal year and  we recorded stock based compensation expenses for awards granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of february   as if the fair value method required for pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  were in effect for expense recognition purposes  adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
for stock based awards granted after february   we have recognized compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value method using the black scholes valuation model 
for all awards  we have continued to recognize compensation expense using a straight line amortization method 
as sfas r requires that stock based compensation expense be based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  stock based compensation for fiscal year and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
when estimating forfeitures  we consider historic termination behavior 
the adoption of the standard had a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we calculated the fair value of each option award on the date of grant under the black scholes option pricing model using certain assumptions 
the computation of expected volatility for fiscal years and is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility from traded options on our common stock 
prior to fiscal year  the computation of expected volatility was based on historical volatility 
we believe that using a combination of historical and market based implied volatility from traded options on our common stock is a better indicator of expected volatility and future stock price trends than relying solely on historical volatility 
the computation of expected lives for fiscal years  and was determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based 
table of contents awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
the ranges provided for fiscal years and result from the behavior patterns of separate groups of employees that have similar historical experience 
the interest rate for periods within the contractual life of the award is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
the application of sfas r is very complex and requires reliance on significant management assumptions  judgments and estimates  including volatility  expected term and forfeiture rates 
the application of different assumptions  judgments or estimates could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
see note  stock based compensation plans  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these assumptions 
results of operations for the years ended january   and revenues we recognize revenues from three sources product revenues  subscription revenues and service revenues  in each case  net of sales returns and other allowances

sufficiency of cash reserves we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operating activities  capital expenditures  and other obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  if during that period or thereafter we are not successful in generating sufficient cash flows from operations or in raising additional financing when required in sufficient amounts on terms acceptable to us  our business could suffer 
we currently plan to reinvest our cash generated from operations in new short and long term investments  in high quality financial  government  and corporate securities or other investments  consistent with past investment practices  and therefore net cash used in investing activities may increase

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we have an investment policy that has been approved by our board of directors

as stated in our investment policy  our first priority is to reduce the risk of principal loss 
consequently  we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to be low risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with our investment portfolio  we performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact a change in interest rates would have on the value of our investment portfolio 
based on investment positions as of january   an immediate hypothetical parallel shift to the yield curve of plus basis points bps  bps and bps would result in a reduction of   and  respectively  in the market value of our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio consists of various marketable debt securities 
the longer the duration of these securities  the more susceptible these securities are to general changes in market interest rates 
as general market interest rates increase  those securities purchased with a lower yield at cost will likely show a mark to market unrealized loss 
all unrealized losses are due to changes in general market interest rates and bond yields
