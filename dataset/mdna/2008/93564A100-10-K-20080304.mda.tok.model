item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis that follows should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data and the accompanying financial statements and notes related thereto that are included elsewhere in this annual report 
it includes forward looking statements that may reflect our estimates  beliefs  plans and expected performance 
the forward looking statements are based upon events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control 
our actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include but are not limited to  market prices for natural gas and oil  regulatory changes  estimates of proved reserves  economic conditions  competitive conditions  development success rates  capital expenditures and other uncertainties  as well as those factors discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report  including in risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  all of which are difficult to predict 
as a result of these assumptions  risks and uncertainties  the forward looking matters discussed may not occur 
overview we are a growing independent energy company engaged in the exploration and development of domestic onshore oil and natural gas reserves 
we focus our efforts primarily on our waterflood oil recovery programs and horizontal drilling in the wilmington field within the los angeles basin of california and on the exploration and development of coalbed methane cbm properties located in the rocky mountain region 
as of december   we owned natural gas and oil leasehold interests in approximately  gross  net acres  of which are undeveloped 
substantially all our undeveloped acreage is located in the rocky mountains 
our total net proved reserves are located on less than of our net acreage 
from our inception in through  we functioned principally as the sponsor of privately placed drilling programs and joint ventures 
under these programs  we contributed drilling locations  paid tangible drilling costs and provided turnkey drilling services  natural gas marketing services and well services to the drilling programs and retained an interest in the wells 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenue was attributable to these turnkey drilling services 
after our initial public offering in  the company has transitioned from being the sponsor of privately placed drilling programs to become a more traditional exploration and development company 
during the second quarter of  the company changed its accounting method for oil and gas properties from the successful efforts method to the full cost method 
as a result of this accounting change  turnkey profit  well services profit and marketing profit are not recognized on the statement of operations but are recorded as reductions to the full cost pool 
all historical information included in this form k has been retroactively restated to give effect to the change in accounting method 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents decreased million during this resulted from cash used in investing activities of million 
this was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of million and cash provided by financing activities of million 
cash used in investing activities primarily results from expenditures on oil and gas properties and equipment 
cash provided by operating activities primarily relates to oil and gas operations 
cash provided by financing activities primarily results from proceeds received from our credit facility as discussed in more detail below 
during june  warren acquired the interests in five drilling partnerships formed from to in which we served as managing general partner and turnkey contract driller 
the independently evaluated december  pv attributable to the aggregate proved oil and gas reserves of the five drilling partnerships was million approximately bcfe of proved developed producing reserves as of december  additionally  the estimated fair market value for related water injection wells was million 
the purchase price was paid in the form of restricted shares of warren s common stock calculated at a discount of from the average publicly traded share price from april  to may  the company issued million restricted shares to these drilling partnerships 
also  as part of contractual commitments  warren was obligated to accept requests for repurchase from the partners in two drilling partnerships formed in the aggregate purchase price for the interests tendered was million plus million restricted shares 
through these purchases the company acquired million of pv as of december  approximately bcfe of proved developed producing reserves and water injection wells having an estimated fair market value of million 
on november   warren entered into a five year  million credit agreement with merrill lynch capital on behalf of a syndicate of five participating banks the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for a revolving credit facility up to the lesser of i the borrowing base ii million or iii the draw limit requested by the company 
the credit facility matures on november  it is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the borrowing base will be determined by the lenders at least semi annually on each april and october  and is based in part on the proved reserves of the company 
interest payments are made quarterly in arrears 
the current borrowing base is million and the overadvance is million  representing an immediate availability of million 
the company is subject to certain covenants under the terms of the credit facility which include  but are not limited to the maintenance of the following financial ratios minimum current ratio including unused borrowing base in current assets of to and a minimum annualized consolidated ebitdax as defined by the credit facility to net interest expense to of to as of december   the company has borrowed million under the credit facility and was in compliance with all covenants 
depending on the current level of borrowing base usage  the annual interest rate on each base rate borrowing under the credit facility will be at our option either a the higher of i the agent s prime rate of interest announced from time to time  or ii the federal funds rate most recently determined by the agent  plus per annum  plus an applicable margin that ranges from to  or b eurodollar loan rate plus an applicable margin that ranges from to 
credit line interest of approximately million was accrued for as of december  during  the company had net income of million as compared to net income of million for and a net loss of million for at december   current liabilities exceeded current assets by approximately million 
we believe cash on hand together with cash flows from operations and our credit line will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures and other operating needs for the next twelve months 
capital expenditure program our capital expenditure budget for is million  which includes participation in the drilling of gross net wells 
at the present time  we are concentrating our drilling activities in california and wyoming 
we have two california projects in the wilmington field  the wilmington townlot unit and the north wilmington unit 
additionally  we have an exploratory project in wyoming referred to as the atlantic rim project 
we are planning to drill gross net producing and injecting wells in california with capital expenditures estimated at million 
we plan to drill gross net wells in the wtu with estimated capital expenditures of million 
we plan to recomplete or drill gross net wells in the nwu with estimated capital expenditures of million 
also  we plan to drill gross net producing and injecting wells in the atlantic rim project in wyoming with estimated capital expenditures of million 
the final determination regarding whether to drill the budgeted wells referred to above is dependent upon many factors including the availability of sufficient capital resources  the ability to acquire proper governmental permits and approvals  and economic and industry conditions at the time of drilling such as prevailing and anticipated energy prices and the availability of drilling equipment 
our estimated total proved reserves as of december  are approximately bcfe with a pv value of billion using december  oil and gas pricing 
approximately of our estimated net proved reserves are undeveloped 
compared with the development of our cbm properties  we anticipate that development of our oil properties in california could have a more immediate impact on our cash flows 
we also anticipate that we will be able to conduct drilling operations in california on a year round basis without weather  environmental or other drilling delays as may occur in the rocky mountain areas where our cbm properties are located 
a substantial portion of our economic success depends on factors over which we have no control  including natural gas and oil prices  operating costs  and environmental and other regulatory matters 
in our planning process  we focus on maintaining financial flexibility together with a low cost structure in order to reduce our vulnerability to these uncontrollable factors 
stock based equity compensation plan information at december   we had approximately million vested outstanding stock options issued under our stock based equity compensation plans 
of the total million outstanding vested options   had exercise prices above the closing market price of our common stock on december  if options with exercise prices below the closing market price on december  are exercised by the holders  we will receive the exercise price in cash 
the following table provides information with respect to shares of our common stock that may be issued under vested stock options whose exercise price was less than our closing stock price on december  exercise price of outstanding vested options number of securities to be issued upon exercise of vested outstanding options proceeds to be received upon exercise of vested outstanding options for additional detail about our stock based equity compensation plans  see executive compensation employee benefit plans under item and as incorporated by reference from our proxy statement on form a 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
below  we provide expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments 
we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management 
oil and gas producing activities effective april   the company adopted the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
previously  the company followed the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas activities 
warren believes that the full cost method is preferable for a company that is actively involved in the exploration and development of oil and gas reserves 
additionally  the full cost method is used by the majority of warren s peers and management believes the change will improve the comparability of warren s financial statements with its peer group 
warren s financial results have been retroactively restated to reflect the full cost method of accounting 
as prescribed by full cost accounting rules  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry hole costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves 
salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the exploration and development of oil and gas properties as well as other internal costs that can be specifically identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities are also capitalized 
proceeds received from disposals are credited against accumulated cost except when the sale represents a significant disposal of reserves  in which case a gain or loss is recognized 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and dismantlement costs are depleted on the equivalent unit of production method  based on proved oil and gas reserves as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
in accordance with full cost accounting rules  warren is subject to a limitation on capitalized costs 
the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties  net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization  may not exceed the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves discounted at percent  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties as adjusted for related tax effects 
if capitalized costs exceed this limit the ceiling limitation  the excess must be charged to expense 
warren did not have any adjustment to earnings due to the ceiling limitation for the periods presented herein 
the costs of certain unevaluated oil and gas properties and exploratory wells being drilled are not included in the costs subject to amortization 
warren assesses costs not being amortized for possible impairments or reductions in value and if a reduction in value has occurred  the portion of the carrying cost in excess of the current value is transferred to costs subject to amortization 
as a result of the change in accounting principle  our accumulated deficit as of january  increased from  as originally reported using the successful efforts method to  using the full cost method 
there was no change in cash flows from operations during these periods presented below 
our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas that engineering and geological analysis demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
our reserve estimates and the projected cash flows are derived from these reserve estimates  in accordance with sec guidelines by an independent engineering firm based in part on data provided by us 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates depends in part on the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
revenue recognition oil and gas sales result from undivided interests held by us in various oil and gas properties 
sales of natural gas and oil produced are recognized when delivered to or picked up by the purchaser

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk in we entered into a financial derivative put contract to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk associated with anticipated future crude oil production 
currently  we have used floor price put agreements to hedge approximately barrels per day of crude oil 
we believe we will have more predictability of our crude oil revenues as a result of these financial derivative contracts 
the following table summarizes our open financial derivative positions as of december  related to natural gas and crude oil production 
product type remaining contract period volume price per mcf or bbl fair value oil put march dec bbld total the company has not elected to designate the aforementioned derivative as a hedge 
the change in fair value resulted in  of net losses recorded to oil and gas revenue for our remaining anticipated production for and beyond is subject to commodity price fluctuations 
interest rate risk we hold investments in us treasury bonds available for sale  which represents securities held in escrow accounts on behalf of the drilling programs and purchasers of certain debentures 
additionally  we hold us treasury bonds trading securities  which predominantly represent us treasury bonds released from escrow accounts 
the fair market value of these securities will generally increase if the federal discount rate decreases and decrease if the federal discount rate increases 
all of our convertible debt has fixed interest rates  so consequently we are not exposed to cash flow or fair value risk from market interest rate changes on this debt 
financial instruments our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  us treasury bonds and other long term liabilities 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  us treasury bonds and other long term liabilities  approximate fair market value due to the highly liquid nature of these short term instruments or they are reported at fair value 
inflation and changes in prices the general level of inflation affects our costs 
salaries and other general and administrative expenses are impacted by inflationary trends and the supply and demand of qualified professionals and professional services 
inflation and price fluctuations affect the costs associated with exploring for and producing natural gas and oil  which have a material impact on our financial performance
