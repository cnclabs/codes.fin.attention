item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes attached as appendix a to this annual report 
in addition to the historical information  the discussion contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements due to applications of our critical accounting policies and factors including  but not limited to  those set forth under the caption risk factors in item a of part i of this annual report 
executive summary overview we offer outsourcing services for private education lending in the united states 
we offer services to national and regional financial institutions and educational institutions for designing and implementing private student loan programs  primarily for undergraduate  graduate and professional education 
in addition  our subsidiary  union federal  is a federally chartered thrift that has offered private student loans directly to consumers and currently offers residential retail mortgages  retail savings products  time deposit products and demand deposit accounts 
we offer services in connection with each of the five typical phases of the student loan lifecycle  enabling our clients to have a single point of interface for program design and marketing  borrower inquiry and application  loan origination and disbursement  loan securitization  if available  and loan servicing and portfolio management 
historically  the primary driver of our results of operations and financial condition has been the volume of student loans for which we have provided outsourcing services from loan origination through securitization 
securitization refers to the technique of pooling loans and selling them to a special purpose  bankruptcy remote entity  typically a trust  which issues securities to investors backed by those loans 
we have provided structural  advisory and other services for securitization transactions since our formation in  and student loan asset backed securitizations have historically been our sole source of permanent financing for our clients private student loan programs 
in the past  we have not taken a direct ownership interest in the student loans our clients generate  nor have we served as a guarantor with respect to any student loan programs that we have facilitated 
we have generally assisted the lenders in our loan programs in selecting their underwriting criteria used in deciding whether a student loan will be made to an applicant 
however  each lender has had ultimate control over the selection of these criteria  and in providing our services  we have been obligated by contract to comply with them 
union federal has funded a portion of our proprietary loan programs in the past  although it is not doing so as of august  union federal held approximately million of private student loans as of june   of which loans with a principal balance of million were pledged as collateral under a warehouse facility provided by a conduit lender 
our proprietary loan programs are astrive student loans  monticello student loans and laurel collegiate loans 
our lender clients have previously had the opportunity to mitigate their credit risk through a loan repayment guaranty by the education resources institute  inc  or teri  pursuant to which teri guaranteed repayment of the borrower s loan principal  together with capitalized or accrued interest  on 
table of contents defaulted loans 
lenders that wished to have their loans guaranteed by teri were required to meet teri s underwriting criteria 
we have been unable to access the securitization market since september as a result of market disruptions that began in the second quarter of fiscal  accelerated during the third quarter of fiscal and persist as of august  that inability  together with the teri reorganization  has impacted our client relationships  resulted in the termination of certain material client agreements  reduced our facilitated loan volume and challenged our business prospects 
we have refined our business model in an attempt to overcome the challenges currently facing us  however  our near term financial performance and future growth will depend in large part on our ability to structure securitizations 
the following table presents certain financial and operating information for the fiscal years ended june   and fiscal year ended june  dollars in thousands approximate number of student loan applications processed approximate number of student loans facilitated approximate number of student loans facilitated that were also available to us for securitization principal amount of student loans facilitated principal amount of student loans facilitated that were also available to us for securitization principal and accrued interest balance of student loans securitized principal balance of student loans facilitated and available to us at year end for later securitization includes billion principal amount of loans with respect to which our purchase rights terminated subsequent to june  in the context of the teri reorganization 
the principal balance of loans facilitated and available to us for later securitization has fluctuated in the past as a result of several factors including a the availability of financing in the securitization market  b the timing and size of securitizations  c the cut off date for loan purchases as securitizations take place  d the loan purchase eligibility criteria included in the various note purchase agreements with our clients that govern the purchase of loans for securitization and e the daily volume of loans facilitated prior to period end 
in the past  we offered our clients a fully integrated suite of outsourcing services  but we did not charge separate fees for many of those services 
moreover  although we received fees for providing loan processing services to teri in connection with teri guaranteed loans  and fees from certain of our clients for marketing coordination services  those fees represented reimbursement of the direct expenses we incurred 
accordingly  we did not earn a profit on those fees in the past 
although we provided those various services without charging a separate fee  or at cost in the case of processing services for teri guaranteed loans and marketing coordination services  we generally entered into agreements with the private label lenders giving us the exclusive right to securitize the student loans that they did not intend to hold 
we received structural advisory fees and residuals for facilitating securitizations of those loans 
we have worked over the past several months to develop all facets of a new private label loan program that would not require a guaranty from a third party  as well as outsourced loan origination services  marketing services and portfolio management services on a stand alone basis 
as a result  we 
table of contents are able to offer both a fully intergrated suite of services for private student loan programs  as well as services on a fee for service basis 
we expect in the future to enter into arrangements with private label lenders under which we provide fee based out sourcing services but may not have the exclusive right to securitize the student loans that they fund 
as in the past  however  we expect our level of profitability to continue to depend in the future on our ability to earn structural advisory fees and residuals for facilitating securitizations 
we also generate fees as the administrator of the trusts that have purchased the private label loans  and in this capacity monitor the performance of the loan servicers 
changes in any of the following factors have and may continue to materially affect our financial results the private student loan securitization market  including the costs or availability of financing and market receptivity to private student loan asset backed notes and auction rate notes  developments in the teri reorganization  actions taken by the rating agencies  including changes to transaction assumptions  ratings actions on outstanding securitization transactions and or modifications of credit enhancement levels  the demand for private education financing  which may be affected by legislation recently passed under consideration as of the date of this annual report  the competition for providing private education financing  the education financing preferences of students and their families  applicable laws and regulations  which may affect the terms upon which our clients agree to make private student loans and the cost and complexity of our loan facilitation operations  the general interest rate and consumer credit environments  including their effect on our discount  default and prepayment rates  our critical accounting policies and estimates  borrower default rates and our ability to recover principal and interest from such borrowers  prepayment rates  including prepayments through loan consolidation of private student loans held by our trusts  and the availability of student loans or grants through federal programs 
business trends  uncertainties and outlook portfolio funding 
the conditions of the debt capital markets generally  and the abs market specifically  rapidly deteriorated beginning in the second quarter of fiscal that deterioration accelerated during the third quarter of fiscal and persists as of august  our business has been and continues to be materially adversely impacted by the current market dynamics  including an inability to access the securitization market and interim financing facilities 
we did not complete a securitization transaction during the second  third or fourth quarters of fiscal  and we do not expect to complete a securitization in the first quarter of fiscal our securitization volumes materially decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  and we expect pricing terms in any near term future securitizations to be substantially less favorable than in the past 
in the near term  we also expect investors to have limited or no demand for subordinate tranches of abs in securitization transactions  if any  that we are able to facilitate 
student loan asset backed securitizations have historically been our sole source of permanent financing for our clients private student loan programs 
as our loans available for securitization 
table of contents volume has grown  we have pursued alternative means to finance our clients loans 
other sources of funding have not been available on acceptable terms  if available at all 
recent conditions in the capital markets have generally resulted in a substantial widening of credit spreads and significantly more restrictive covenants  which has adversely affected the pricing  terms and conditions of alternative funding mechanisms we have pursued 
sale of preferred stock 
we have received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million from the sale of preferred stock to affiliates of gscp 
in december  affiliates of gscp invested million to acquire shares of our series a preferred stock  and they also agreed to invest up to an additional million to acquire shares of our series b convertible preferred stock  subject to receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and determinations and satisfaction of other conditions 
the total investment by the purchasers  including their initial investment of million  was capped by the terms of the investment agreement at an amount equal to of our total stockholders equity  consistent with regulations of the ots 
as a result of a decrease in our stockholders equity since the time of the initial investment by the purchasers  and based on our stockholder s equity as of june   the subsequent equity investment by the purchasers  which closed on august   was limited to million 
teri reorganization 
in june  we acquired teri s loan processing operations  including its historical database  but not its investment assets or guaranty liabilities 
in connection with this acquisition  we entered into a master servicing agreement pursuant to which teri engaged us to provide loan origination and processing services with respect to the student loans generated through the private label programs we facilitated  as well as other teri guaranteed loans 
pursuant to the master servicing agreement  we were entitled to reimbursement from teri for the expenses we incurred in providing these services 
under the terms of a master loan guaranty agreement that we had entered into with teri  we had also agreed to provide a beneficial interest for teri in a portion of the residual value of securitization trusts that purchased teri guaranteed loans  and granted to teri a right of first refusal to provide a third party guaranty of our private label clients existing and future loan programs 
in october  we renewed our master servicing agreement  master loan guaranty agreement and certain additional agreements with teri  in each case for an additional term through june on april   teri filed a voluntary petition for reorganization 
in june  the bankruptcy court entered an order approving a motion by teri to reject the master servicing agreement  the master loan guaranty agreement and certain additional agreements 
as a result of the order  each of the agreements was terminated effective as of may  in april and may  the bankruptcy court issued interim orders prohibiting teri from withdrawing any amounts from its segregated reserve accounts until further order by the bankruptcy court 
in june  the bankruptcy court entered an order approving a motion by teri to purchase defaulted loans using cash in pledged accounts  which we refer to as pledged accounts  established for the benefit of certain securitization trusts 
the order was granted subject to the following the creditors committee  or any other person or entity  had the right to challenge the validity  perfection  priority or enforceability of the trusts security interests in i the pledged accounts within days following the order  ii funds transferred to the pledged accounts after the filing of teri s petition for reorganization  which we refer to as post petition transfers  within days following the order and iii collateral securing teri s guaranty obligations other than the pledged accounts and the post petition transfers such as recoveries on loans that have previously defaulted within days following the order 
recoveries that have not been transferred to a pledged account will be placed in a segregated account and held in such account until the earlier of i the st day following the order and ii the entry of an order by the bankruptcy court directing the disposition  transfer or other use of funds in such account 

table of contents the bankruptcy court  with the assent of all affected parties  subsequently extended until october  all parties rights to challenge the trusts security interests in the collateral securing teri s guaranty obligations other than the pledged accounts 
extension of the objection deadline will allow the creditors committee additional time to review and discuss its potential objections with the affected parties 
if the creditors committee or any other party were successful in challenging the trusts security interests in the post petition transfers or other collateral  including recoveries  amounts available exclusively to a particular securitization trust to satisfy teri s guaranty obligations to that trust would decrease materially 
the trust s unsecured claims against teri would increase proportionately 
for example  recoveries from defaulted student loans  which have historically been used to replenish a particular trust s pledge fund  would instead become an asset of teri s bankruptcy estate and available to satisfy administrative claims of teri s bankruptcy estate and claims of unsecured creditors 
in addition  teri may seek to reject its guaranty obligations entirely in the context of the teri reorganization 
any of these developments would decrease materially our service receivables and could further harm our ability to structure securitizations in the future 
prepayment and default trends 
although it can be difficult to discern trends in the overall portfolio  we observed that prepayment rates generally rose for the first three quarters of fiscal and generally fell during the last quarter of fiscal we estimate that prepayment rates decreased by more than from the third fiscal quarter to the fourth fiscal quarter  primarily due  we believe  to an increase in the spread between libor and prevailing mortgage rates and a slow down in loan consolidation activities 
there is a lag between certain indicators and their effect on prepayment rates 
during the twelve months ended june   defaults generally increased in our securitized loan portfolio  causing us to adjust upward our assumed gross assumptions  from to  and our net default assumptions  from to 
we believe that defaults trended higher during fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the generally adverse consumer credit trends and a material increase in the number of loans in early repayment status 
student loans tend to experience higher rates of delinquencies and defaults in the early years of repayment compared to later years 
over the past five months  we have implemented several collections initiatives  including early awareness campaigns and increased focus on early stage delinquencies  which we expect to reduce delinquencies and  ultimately  defaults 
we remain uncertain of their effect  however  and we concluded that despite apparently good initial results  it would be premature to discern positive long term trends as of june  outlook 
we continue to believe that private student loans are an important source of college funding 
college attendance is high  the overall cost of college continues to rise  government supported loans are limited 
added pressure for funding education may also result from declining home values and the unavailability of home equity loans that have been a source of funding for education in the past 
we believe that borrowers will need responsible private student loan solutions after exhausting all available scholarships  grants and federal aid 
moreover  the college cost reduction and access act of has significantly reduced the profit margins of traditional non governmental providers of federal loans  and we believe that we will continue to see competitors and potential competitors exit the student loan industry 
we have recently developed alternatives to the loan guaranty and loan origination services that teri has historically provided to our clients 
we have developed a private label loan program that would not require a guaranty from a third party  and we have begun to offer outsourced loan origination services  marketing services and portfolio management services on a stand alone basis 
these initiatives will be critical in order to grow our revenues and client base in the future 
compared to past teri guaranteed loan programs  the new private label loan program has been designed to have more selective underwriting criteria  higher borrower pricing and a greater proportion of immediate repayment loans  or loans for which payment of principal and interest begins shortly after final 
table of contents disbursement  and interest only loans  or loans for which payment of interest begins shortly after disbursement but payment of principal is deferred during enrollment 
we are uncertain of the level of interest from former  current or prospective clients with regard to the new program or the offered services 
union federal is not  as of august   able to meaningfully fund loan origination in the private label loan program due to its current lack of funding capacity 
although significant uncertainty exists regarding the success or market acceptance of our new products and services and our ability to access the securitization markets  we believe that our experience in the private student loan industry  coupled with the liquidity provided by the recent equity investment by affiliates of gscp positions us to be successful in the future 
securitizations and related revenue we have historically structured and facilitated securitization transactions for our clients through a series of bankruptcy remote  qualified special purpose statutory trusts 
the trusts obtain through the securitization process private student loans from the originating lenders or their assignees  which relinquish to the trust their ownership interest in the loans 
the debt instruments that the trusts issue to finance the purchase of these student loans are obligations of the trusts  rather than our obligations or those of originating lenders or their assignees 
we refer to the trusts utilized in the securitization of teri guaranteed private label loans as private label loan trusts 
at june   the principal balance of loans facilitated and available to us for securitization was approximately billion 
under the terms of our purchase agreements with lender clients  we generally have an obligation to use our best efforts to facilitate the purchase of the client s loans during a specified loan purchase period 
the length of the loan purchase period varies by client and generally ranges from days to days following final loan disbursement 
if we fail to facilitate a purchase in breach of our obligations  our damages would be limited under the terms of certain of our purchase agreements to liquidated damages of one percent of the total principal amount of the loans as to which the loan purchase period had expired 
certain other purchase agreements  however  do not include a liquidated damages provision 
those purchase agreements that limit our liability to liquidated damages generally provide that our obligation to close a securitization is subject to the condition that no market disruption event has occurred 
the teri reorganization constitutes a market disruption event under certain of these purchase agreements  suspending our contractual obligation to close a securitization with respect to approximately billion of our facilitated loan volume available for securitization as of june   excluding approximately million of loan volume originated by union federal 
our purchase agreements applicable to approximately billion of the facilitated loan volume available for securitization as of june  do not include a liquidated damages provision in the event that we fail to facilitate a securitization in breach of our obligations  and the amount of our potential liability with respect to such loans is not determinable at this time 
we have received several types of fees in connection with our past securitization services structural advisory fees 
we have charged structural advisory fees that were to be paid in two portions up front 
we received a portion of the structural advisory fees at the time the securitization trust purchased the loans 
in exchange for these fees  we structured the debt securities sold in the securitization  coordinated the attorneys  accountants  trustees  loan servicers  loan originators and other transaction participants and prepared cash flow modeling for rating agencies as needed 
for the securitizations of teri guaranteed loans that we facilitated during fiscal  these fees were of the aggregate principal and accrued interest of the loans securitized 
for the securitizations of teri guaranteed loans 
table of contents we facilitated in fiscal  these fees ranged from to of the aggregate principal and accrued interest of the loans securitized 
the four private label loan trusts we facilitated in fiscal issued triple b rated securities  the only such issuances by any of our securitizations trusts 
the issuance of triple b rated securities enabled us to increase the up front structural advisory fee yield  with a decrease in the amount of residuals we expect to receive  from these securitization transactions 
we are uncertain as of august  whether the fee structure that we have historically used will be used in any future securitization transactions 
in particular  market conditions may dictate that we reduce or forgo our up front structural advisory fee in connection with securitizations  if any  that we are able to facilitate in the near term  and additional 
we are entitled to receive a portion of the structural advisory fees over time  based on the amount of loans outstanding in the private label loan trust from time to time over the life of the trust 
this portion accumulates monthly in each trust from the date of a securitization transaction at a rate of to basis points per year 
we generally become entitled to receive this additional portion  plus interest  once the ratio of trust assets to trust liabilities  which we refer to as the parity ratio  reaches a stipulated level  which ranges from to 
our receipt of these fees  however  may be significantly delayed as a result of the teri reorganization under the terms of the indentures relating to the trusts 
see application of critical accounting policies and estimates service revenue and receivables teri s ability to pay claims 
at june   we expect to receive the additional fees beginning five to sixteen years after the date of a particular securitization transaction 
in addition  stipulated parity ratio levels may be raised if certain trust characteristics change 
the level applicable to a particular private label loan trust is determined at the time of securitization 
actual parity ratios of our private label loan trusts as of june  ranged from to 
please refer to exhibit to this annual report for additional information on actual trust parity ratios as of june  residual 
we also have the right to receive a portion of the residual interests that these private label loan trusts create 
this interest is junior in priority to the rights of the holders of the debt sold in the securitizations and additional structural advisory fees  and generally entitles us to receive to of the net cash flows of the particular private label loan trust once a parity ratio of to  depending on the particular trust  is reached and maintained 
our receipt of these fees  however  may be significantly delayed as a result of the teri reorganization under the terms of the indentures relating to the trusts 
see application of critical accounting policies and estimates service revenue and receivables teri s ability to pay claims 
our residual interest derives almost exclusively from the services we perform in connection with each securitization rather than from a direct cash contribution to the securitization trust 
in the case of securitizations of exclusively private label loans  at june   we expect to receive the residuals beginning approximately five to seventeen years after the date of a particular securitization 
administrative and other fees 
our administrative and other fees are derived primarily from two sources a our subsidiary  first marblehead data services  inc  receives fees for its services in administering securitization trusts  including their daily management and obtaining information from loan servicers and reporting this and other information to the parties related to the securitization  and b our subsidiary  union federal  receives marketing fees upon the securitization of its education loans 
in addition  we are reimbursed for out of pocket costs we received at the time of securitization related to marketing coordination services performed for 
table of contents some of our clients 
our fees for performing the administrative services range from to basis points per year based on the student loan balance in the trust 
processing fees from teri historically  we provided outsourcing services for teri  including loan origination  customer service  default processing  default prevention and administrative services under a master servicing agreement between teri and us 
we recognized as revenue the monthly reimbursement that teri provided us for the expenses we incurred in providing these services 
during fiscal  we received million in processing fees from teri pursuant to the master servicing agreement 
on june   in the context of the teri reorganization  the bankruptcy court entered an order approving a motion by teri to reject the master servicing agreement 
as a result of the order  the master servicing agreement was terminated effective as of may  as a result of the termination  we will not receive processing fees from teri pursuant to the master servicing agreement for any period after may  in addition  we have a claim with regard to million of processing fees from teri that were due  but unpaid  prior to the filing of teri s bankruptcy petition 
the order  however  approved a motion by teri to enter into a transition services agreement with us with a term until september  effective on june   we began receiving fees from teri as set forth in the transition services agreement 
recognition and valuation of service revenue we recognize up front structural advisory fees as revenue at the time the securitization trust purchases the loans 
in order for the securitization trust to purchase the loans  all of the applicable services must be performed  rating agencies must deliver their ratings letters  transaction counsel must deliver the required legal opinions and the underwriters must receive the debt securities issued by the securitization trust 
these events indicate that the securitization transaction has been properly structured and loans have been properly sold to the securitization trust 
as required under gaap  we also recognize the fair value of additional structural advisory fees and residuals as revenue at that time  as they are deemed to be earned at the time of the securitization but before we actually receive payment 
these amounts are deemed earned because evidence of an arrangement exists  we have provided the services  the fee is fixed and determinable based upon a discounted cash flow analysis  there are no future contingencies or obligations and collection is reasonably assured 
under gaap  we are required to estimate the fair value of the additional structural advisory fees and residuals as if they are investments in debt securities classified as available for sale or trading  similar to retained interests in securitizations 
accordingly  we record additional structural advisory fees and residuals receivable on our balance sheet at estimated fair value using a discounted cash flow model 
because there are no quoted market prices for our additional structural advisory fees and residuals receivable  we use certain key assumptions to estimate their values 
see application of critical accounting policies and estimates service revenue and receivables 
we estimate the fair value both initially and at each subsequent quarter and reflect the change in the value in earnings for that period 
we generally recognize administrative and other fees  as well as processing fees from teri  as revenue at the time that we perform the underlying services 
we recognize marketing coordination fees and marketing premiums earned on proprietary brands  which are components of administrative and other fees  at the time the securitization trust purchases the loans derived from the related marketing coordination services or when the related expense is incurred 

table of contents quarterly fluctuations our quarterly revenue  operating results and profitability have varied on a quarterly basis in the past primarily as a result of the timing  size and structure of any capital market transactions that we have facilitated and  to a lesser extent  the seasonality of student loan originations  which in the past has affected the amount of processing fees from teri that we earned in a particular quarter 
the variability of our quarterly revenue and operating results has increased and may continue to increase as a result of current conditions in the capital markets and lower levels of facilitated loan volumes 
in fiscal  we facilitated one securitization in each of the first  second and third quarters and two securitizations in the fourth quarter 
we facilitated two securitization transactions in the first quarter of fiscal  but we did not conduct a securitization transaction during the second  third or fourth quarters of fiscal a continuing inability to access the capital markets  variations in the size  structure or economic terms of any future transactions  or the level of our facilitated loan volumes and operating expenses  could continue to materially adversely affect and result in increased variability of our operating results on a quarterly basis 
the following tables set forth our quarterly revenue and net income loss for each quarter of fiscal and fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total in thousands total revenues net income loss fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total in thousands total revenues net income application of critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under varying assumptions or conditions 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june   which are attached as appendix a to this annual report 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  particularly as they relate to accounting policies that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements to be a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on our financial condition or operating performance is material 
we have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that our estimates relating to the recognition and valuation of our securitization related revenue and receivables  as described below  fit the definition of critical accounting estimates 
we also consider our policy with respect to the determination of whether or not to consolidate the financial results of the securitization trusts that we facilitate to be a critical accounting policy 
service revenue and receivables for a discussion of our revenue recognition policies  see recognition and valuation of service revenue above 
because there are no quoted market prices for our additional structural advisory fees or residuals receivable  we use discounted cash flow modeling techniques and the following key assumptions to estimate their values the discount rate  which we use to calculate the fair value of our additional structural advisory fees and residuals  the annual rate and timing of student loan prepayments  the trend of interest rates over the life of the loan pool  including the forward libor curve  and the spread between libor and auction rates  expected annual rate and timing of loan defaults  and teri s ability to pay default claims  expected recoveries of defaulted loans  including use of recoveries to replenish trusts pledged funds  the source and amount of guaranty payments made on defaulted loans  and fees and expenses of the securitization trusts 
we base these estimates on our proprietary historical data  publicly available third party data and our industry experience  adjusting for specific program and borrower characteristics such as loan type and borrower creditworthiness 
we also monitor trends in loan performance over time and make adjustments we believe are necessary to value properly our receivables balances at each balance sheet date 
because our estimates rely on quantitative and qualitative factors  including macroeconomic indicators to predict prepayment  default and recovery rates  management s ability to determine which factors are more heavily weighted in our estimates  and our ability to accurately incorporate those factors into our estimates  can have a material effect on our valuations 
we have posted to our website  and filed as exhibit to this annual report  static pool data as of june   including actual borrower payment status  delinquency  cumulative loss and prepayment data as of june  for certain securitization trusts that we have facilitated 
we have 
table of contents also posted to our website  and filed as exhibit to this annual report  a supplemental presentation of certain historical trust performance data  including channel specific loans available for securitization by fiscal year  parity ratios by trust  net recovery rates by trust  fico score  which is a measure of credit risk  ranges by year of origination and by channel  fico score distributions for loans disbursed since january   payment status by trust and six month rolling prepayment rates by trust 
the following table shows the approximate weighted average assumptions for loan performance at june   and for our private label loan trusts percentage discount rate percentage rate structural advisory fees june  default recovery prepayments residuals in selecting loan performance assumptions  we consider the underlying creditworthiness of the student loan borrowers as well as the type of loans being securitized 
we analyze creditworthiness in several tiers and select what we believe to be appropriate loan performance assumptions based on those tiers 
past teri guaranteed private label loan programs  under which approximately of the borrowers have a creditworthy cosigner  typically a family member  had an extensive credit underwriting process 
net default rates 
the net default rate is calculated as the weighted average for all of our private label securitization trusts of the estimated cumulative principal balance  including capitalized interest  of defaulted student loans over the life of a trust  which we refer to as the endpoint defaults  minus the estimated cumulative amount of recoveries on defaulted loans over the life of the trust  divided by the original principal balance  including capitalized interest  of loans held by the trust 
a securitization trust may have a life of over years  based on a lifecycle for student loans that includes borrowers in school deferment  grace  repayment and forbearance periods 
higher levels of loan defaults are generally expected to occur in the early years of a trust  as loans enter repayment 
recoveries on defaulted loans are expected to lag defaults by months or years  with cumulative recoveries increasing gradually over an extended period of time later in the life of a trust 
as a result  at a single point in time  particularly early in the life of a trust  a trust may experience an actual net default rate that is higher than the estimated endpoint net default rate for that trust 
for the same reason  we assess the actual current net default rates against an expected default timing curve  which reflects the expected speed of defaults over the life of a trust 
the shape of the default curve is based in part on our proprietary database of more than years of loan performance information  reflecting data through a variety of economic cycles  and influences the estimated endpoint defaults  which in turn influence the net default rate 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we increased the weighted average net default rate assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our residuals and additional structural advisory fees receivables 
in response to an acceleration in default activity coupled with deterioration in overall consumer credit quality  we increased the assumed net default rate from to on average for the portfolio 
this increase in the net default rate assumptions during the second fiscal quarter resulted in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our residuals receivable of million and a decrease in the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fees receivable of million 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we increased our assumed average gross default rate from 
table of contents to 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we also increased  from to  the percentage of defaulted loans that we expect to recover 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we maintained our weighted average net default rate assumptions at for the portfolio 
for securitization trusts facilitated prior to january   we increased our net default rate assumptions as a result of default activity that was higher than expected 
for securitization trusts facilitated after january   we decreased our net default rate assumptions to reflect recent collections strategies implemented by us and an expectation of a better economic cycle as borrowers in the future enter repayment 
the overall net impact of these two changes was a slight increase to our assumed weighted average gross default rate  from to 
although the weighted average gross default rate did not change materially in the aggregate  we accelerated the timing of expected default activity  which resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the estimated fair value of our residuals receivable and a decrease of approximately  in the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fees receivable 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we did not adjust the percentage of defaulted loans that we expect to recover 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we increased our weighted average gross default rate from to 
we have historically derived endpoint default rates taking into account the underwriting criteria and marketing channel of the loan 
beginning in the fourth fiscal quarter  we further enhanced our model to take into account the current pipeline of delinquencies  through delinquency flow assumptions that we believe will better predict defaults expected over the subsequent six months 
in addition  we further enhanced our model including the multiplier that enables us to model the shape of the default timing curve based on economic and other factors subsequent to the delinquency timeframes 
as a result  we believe our default timing curve more closely tracks actual results and enables us to apply multipliers to adjust for events or economic cycles that we may experience in the future 
for the fourth quarter of fiscal  the increase in our weighted average gross default rate resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the estimated fair value of our residuals receivable and a decrease of approximately  in the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fees receivable 
for all of fiscal  the increase in our weighted average gross default rate and changes to our timing curve resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the estimated fair value of our residuals receivable and a decrease of approximately million in the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fees receivable 
teri s ability to pay claims 
the indentures relating to the securitization trusts specify certain circumstances  which we refer to as trigger events  in which payments that would otherwise be due in respect of additional structural advisory fees and residuals instead be directed to the holders of the notes issued by the trusts until the conditions causing the trigger event cease to exist or all notes  and related interest  are paid in full 
under the indentures  a trigger event generally occurs when the cumulative gross defaults of loans held by such trust exceed a specified level 
under certain of the indentures  a trigger event would not occur even if cumulative loan defaults exceed the specified level if teri continues to pay claims on defaulted loans and  in the case of certain indentures  is solvent 
as a result of the teri reorganization  we adjusted our assumptions to assume that amounts available to pay a trust s default claims will be limited to amounts available from the segregated reserve account pledged to the trust by teri as collateral for teri s guaranty obligations  assuming that recoveries on defaulted loans would replenish such accounts 
previously  we assumed that teri would pay default claims on a timely basis and that no default trigger event would occur 
although the overall expected cash flows generated by the trusts would improve as a result of the higher priority of repayment of the notes  the expected timing of cash payments to us in respect of its additional structural advisory fees and residuals would be delayed  reducing their estimated fair value 
the change in our assumptions with regard to teri s ability to pay claims resulted in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our residuals receivable of million and a decrease in the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fees receivable of million during the third quarter of fiscal 
table of contents prepayment rates 
we compute prepayments as the difference between the total amount of payments  both principal and interest  received from or on behalf of a borrower and the amount of principal and interest billed to the borrower during the same period 
to convert this dollar amount into a rate  we divide these amounts by the dollar amounts that could possibly have been repaid during that period and annualize the result 
this approach results in a rate that is expressed as a conditional prepayment rate  or cpr 
the cpr is essentially an estimate of the likelihood that a loan will be prepaid during a period  given that it has not previously defaulted or been prepaid 
the prepayment rate can be significantly different at different points in time over the life of a trust  or any pool of loans  because the prepayment rate for a given cohort of loans will vary with their seasoning 
a loan in deferment is expected to have a low likelihood of being prepaid 
a loan is expected to have a higher likelihood of being repaid during the first  compared to the second  year of repayment 
however  after the second year  as a loan becomes more seasoned  the likelihood of a prepayment is expected to increase further  as borrowers increase their earnings power and their ability to partially or fully prepay their loans  or as they establish better credit and are offered more opportunities to consolidate their student loans 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we increased the assumed average annual rate of prepayments that we use to estimate the fair value of our residuals and structural advisory fees receivables 
we did not  at that time  make an adjustment to the shape of the expected prepayment curve  which reflects our assumption regarding the timing of prepayments expected to occur over the life of the trusts 
the increase in the assumed average prepayment rate during the third quarter of fiscal  from an average over the life of the trusts of to  resulted in a decrease in the fair value of the residuals receivable of million and a decrease in the fair value of the additional structural advisory fees receivable of million 
we recognized both of these decreases in the third quarter of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we further altered our assumption by adjusting the shape of the expected prepayment curve in response to actual experience 
the result was an increase in the assumed average prepayment rate over the life of the trusts from to 
this change in the prepayment rate assumption resulted in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our residuals receivable of million and a decrease in the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fees receivable of million during the second quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we developed multiple prepayment curves based on credit tiers through the first seven years of the life of the loan  rather than utilizing a single average prepayment curve  to assess our prepayment rate assumption 
the model generally demonstrated that loans in higher credit tiers have a higher rate of prepayment than loans in lower credit tiers 
although this change did not result in an adjustment to the average prepayment rate assumption of during the fourth fiscal quarter  the average interest rate on securitized loans is projected to increase as a result of retirement of loans with lower interest rates more quickly than loans with higher interest rates 
use of the enhanced model resulted in an increase of approximately million in the estimated fair value of our residuals receivable 
we continue to monitor actual prepayment rates against our expectations and will make such future adjustments to our assumptions as we believe are necessary at each balance sheet date 
discount rate residuals 
in determining an appropriate discount rate for valuing our residuals  we historically have reviewed the rates used by student loan securitizers as well as rates used in the much broader abs market 
prior to fiscal  we applied a discount rate of in estimating the present value of our residuals  based on the expected timing of cash flows and the maximum year life of the trust assets and residuals 
during fiscal  we facilitated four securitization transactions involving the issuance of triple b rated securities  the only such issuances by any of our securitization trusts 
triple b rated issuances  in effect  allowed us to monetize a portion of our securitization related revenues that previously would 
table of contents have been recognized as residuals 
accordingly  we believed that market developments had provided us with a meaningful basis to revise our input in determining the discount rate applied in estimating the fair value of pre fiscal private label securitization trust residuals 
beginning with the third quarter of fiscal  we applied a discount rate equal to the trailing month average of the one month libor plus to value the portion of the residuals that we believed qualified as investment grade in the pre fiscal private label trusts 
that portion of the residuals that we believed did not qualify as investment grade was discounted at  as it was in the securitization trusts that issued triple b rated securities 
the decrease in the aggregated average discount rate resulted in an increase in the fair value of our residuals receivable of million which we recorded in the third quarter of fiscal based on deteriorating conditions in the abs market  we reverted to a discount rate of in the first quarter of fiscal in estimating the fair value of residuals from securitization trusts that had not issued triple b rated securities 
this increase in the aggregate average discount rate resulted in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our residuals receivable of million which we recognized in the first quarter of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  in response to continued deterioration in the abs market  we increased the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of residuals receivable by basis points 
as a result  we applied a discount rate of for purposes of estimating the fair value of residuals from securitization trusts that had not issued triple b rated securities and a discount rate of for purposes of estimating the fair value of residuals from securitization trusts that had issued triple b rated securities 
the increase in the discount rate assumption resulted in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our residuals receivable of million during the second quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  in response to a further deterioration in the abs market and revised assumptions regarding teri s ability to pay guaranty claims from its general reserves  we increased the discount rate used to estimate the fair value of residuals receivable by basis points 
as a result  we applied a discount rate at march  of for purposes of estimating the fair value of residuals from securitization trusts that had not issued triple b rated securities and a discount rate of for purposes of estimating the fair value of residuals from securitization trusts that had issued triple b rated securities 
this increase in the discount rate resulted in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our residuals receivable of million during the third quarter of fiscal at june   due to the continued dislocation in the capital markets environment and the private student loan securities sector  we increased the discount rate by basis points 
we applied a discount rate of for purposes of estimating the fair value of residuals from securitization trusts that had not issued triple b rated securities and a discount rate of for purposes of estimating the fair value of residuals from securitization trusts that had issued triple b rated securities  which resulted in a decrease of million in the estimated fair value of our residuals during the fourth quarter of fiscal discount rate additional structural advisory fees 
historically  we have based the discount rate that we use to estimate the fair value of our additional structural advisory fees on a spread over the year us treasury note rate 
prior to the second quarter of fiscal  we believed that a spread of basis points was an appropriate discount rate based on the priority payment status of additional structural advisory fees in the flow of funds out of the securitization trusts and comparable spreads on structured and corporate debt securities 
from june  to june   the year us treasury note rate decreased basis points 
a decrease in the year us treasury note rate has the effect of increasing the estimated fair value of our structural advisory fees receivable  while an increase in the rate has the opposite effect on our estimate of fair value 
during the second quarter of fiscal  in response to continued deterioration in the market for structured and corporate debt securities  we increased by basis points the spread over the year us treasury note rate that we used to estimate the fair value of our additional structural advisory fees 
as a result  we applied a 
table of contents discount rate at december  of  compared to a discount rate at september  of 
the net increase in the discount rate assumption resulted in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fee receivable of million during the second quarter of fiscal between december  and march   the year us treasury note rate decreased basis points 
in addition  during the third quarter of fiscal  in response to continued deterioration in the market for structured and corporate debt securities and revised assumptions regarding teri s ability to pay guaranty claims from its general reserves  we increased by basis points the spread over the year us treasury note rate that we use to estimate the fair value of our additional structural advisory fees 
as a result  we applied a discount rate at march  of  based on the us treasury note rate plus basis points  compared to a discount rate at december  of  based on the us treasury note rate plus basis points 
the net increase in the discount rate resulted in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fees net receivable of million during the third quarter of fiscal as a result of the continued dislocation in the capital markets environment and the private student loan abs sector  at june   we increased the spread from basis points to basis points over the year us treasury note rate to estimate the fair value of our additional structural advisory fees 
in addition  between march  and june   the year us treasury note rate increased by basis points 
as a result  we applied a discount rate at june  of  compared to a discount rate at march  of 
the increase in the discount rate resulted in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fees net receivable of approximately million during the fourth quarter of fiscal auction rate note interest rates 
five private label loan trusts have issued auction rate notes to finance the purchase of student loans 
interest rates for the auction rate notes are determined from time to time at auction 
at december   we used a spread over libor to project the future cost of funding of the auction rate notes issued by each such trust 
historically  the spread over libor used to estimate the future cost of funding was based on historical trends  then current auction rates for each trust and assumptions for future auction rates 
during the second quarter of fiscal  material deterioration of the debt capital markets resulted in actual auction rates that trended significantly higher than the rates we had assumed in the past 
we expect these higher actual rates to persist  resulting in a larger spread over libor for a longer period of time than we had previously estimated 
as a result  we revised the spread over libor that we used to estimate the fair value of our residuals and additional structural advisory fees receivables to better reflect the expected spreads over libor in the future 
the change in our auction rate assumption resulted in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our residual receivable of million and a decrease in the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fee receivable of  during the second quarter of fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal  failed auctions occurred with respect to auction rate notes issued by each of the five securitization trusts that have issued auction rate notes 
as a result of the failed auctions  the auction rate notes bear interest at a maximum rate  which is calculated as one month libor plus  in the case of auction rate notes that are rated at least aa by moody s and aa by s p or one month libor plus  in the case of auction rate notes that are rated at least a by moody s and a by s p  based on the ratings assigned to the auction rate notes as of august  auction rate notes issued by two securitization trusts are also rated by fitch and bear interest at a maximum rate that is calculated as one month libor plus  in the case of auction rate notes that are rated at least aa by fitch as of august   or one month libor plus  in the case of auction rate notes that are rated at least a by fitch as of august  during the third quarter of fiscal  we revised our assumption with regard to the future cost of funding of auction rate notes 
we assumed at march  that all outstanding auction rate notes 
table of contents will continue to bear interest at these current maximum spreads over one month libor until their expected maturity dates 
as a result  during the third quarter of fiscal  we decreased the estimated fair value of our residuals receivable by million and the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fees receivable by  as a result of our change in the auction rate notes assumption 
we maintained our assumptions as of june  it is possible  in the event of certain ratings agency actions  that these maximum spreads can increase further 
if any auction rate note were to be rated below aa but at least a by moody s  and below aa but at least a by s p and fitch  as applicable  it would bear an interest rate of one month libor plus 
furthermore  if any auction rate note were to be rated below a by moody s and below a by s p and fitch  as applicable  its maximum auction rate would be calculated as one month libor plus 
if auctions do not fail  but the interest rate determined pursuant to the auction procedures exceed the maximum rate  the interest rate for the applicable interest period would be set at the maximum rate 
the amount of the excess interest  however  would accrue as carryover interest 
a noteholder s right to receive carryover interest is superior to our additional structural advisory fees and residual interest in the applicable securitization trust 
as a result  our projected cash releases from securitization trusts that have issued auction rate notes  including the timing of receipt  could be materially adversely affected by increased costs of funding of auction rate notes  including the extent to which a trust accrues carryover interest 
in estimating the fair value of our service receivables  we have assumed that no trust will accrue carryover interest 
fees and expenses 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we took into account default prevention and other collections related costs into our estimates of the fair value of our additional structural advisory fees and residuals receivable 
previously  these costs were reimbursed by teri pursuant to the master loan guaranty agreement and were excluded from our valuation model 
in light of the termination of the master loan guaranty agreement effective as of may   however  we no longer receive reimbursement for such expenses 
at june   we estimated the aggregate costs necessary to achieve our gross default rate assumption  which resulted in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our residual receivable of million and a decrease in the estimated fair value of our additional structural advisory fee receivable of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal sensitivity analysis increases in our estimates of defaults  prepayments and discount rates  increases in the spread between libor indices and auction rates  as well as decreases in default recovery rates and the multi year forward estimates of libor  would have a negative effect on the value of our additional structural advisory fees and residuals 
student loan prepayments include either full or partial payments by a borrower in advance of the maturity schedule specified in the credit agreement  including payments as a result of loan consolidation activity 
if amounts in the segregated reserve accounts pledged to securitization trusts by teri were unavailable to pay the trust s default claims or if recoveries on defaulted loans were not used to replenish such accounts  or if net defaults increase beyond the level of expected third party reimbursement assumptions  then these changes will have an additional negative effect on the value of our additional structural advisory fees and residuals 
libor is the reference rate for a substantial majority of the loan assets and  we believe  a reasonable index for borrowings of the trusts 
because the trusts student loan assets earn interest based on libor and some trusts have outstanding securities that pay interest based on the results of auction rates  changes in the spread between libor and the auction rate can affect the performance of the trusts which have issued auction rate notes 
the following table shows our loan performance assumptions and service receivables balances at june  and estimated changes that would result from changes in our loan performance 
table of contents assumptions 
the effect on the fair value of the structural advisory fees and residuals receivables are based on variations of or  except for the forward libor rates  which are based on variations of and from the forward libor rates at june  we also discuss below the effect on the fair value of the structural advisory fees and residuals receivables of changes in the assumed spread between month libor rates and auction rates

consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the first marblehead corporation and its subsidiaries  after eliminating inter company accounts and transactions 
we have not consolidated the financial results of the securitization trusts purchasing loans that we have facilitated 
prior to july   this accounting treatment was in accordance with various emerging issues task force issues and related interpretations 
we considered  among other things  the following factors in assessing consolidation of the securitization trusts we did not have unilateral decision making abilities related to significant matters affecting the securitization trusts  such as asset acquisition  prepayment of debt  placement of debt obligations and modification of trust documents  we did not have substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership  as teri provided substantially all of the student loan guarantees  we were a facilitator of securitization transactions  for which we received market based fees  and we were not the transferor of assets to the securitization trusts  and our continuing involvement in the trusts was limited to a passive residual interest and our role as an administrator for the trust for which we receive market based fees 
beginning july   and for securitization trusts created after january   we applied financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no

the fasb is expected to issue an exposure draft on this topic and the ultimate impact  if any  of these deliberations on our accounting practices is uncertain at this time 
results of operations years ended june   june  and june  revenue related to securitization transactions we primarily offer services in connection with private label education loan products offered through two marketing channels a direct to consumer  which generally refers to programs that lenders market directly to prospective borrowers and their families  and b school channel  which refers to programs that lenders market indirectly to student borrowers and their families through educational institutions 
in either case  lenders may engage third parties that are not themselves lenders but which market loans on behalf of lenders that fund the loans 
we refer to these third parties as loan marketers  and we refer to the lenders that fund these loans as program lenders 
we facilitated two securitization transactions in the first quarter of fiscal and no securitizations during the second  third or fourth fiscal quarters 
during fiscal  we facilitated one securitization in each of the first  second and third fiscal quarters and two securitizations in the fourth fiscal quarter 
our estimates of the allocation by marketing channel of our securitization revenues for 
table of contents fiscal  and  expressed as a percentage of the total principal and accrued interest of private label loans securitized in each channel at the date of securitization  are as follows percentage yield month and year of private label securitization marketing channel volume of loans securitized up front structural advisory fees additional structural advisory fees residuals total dollars in millions september direct to consumer  school channel total  fiscal blended yield june direct to consumer school channel total blended yield march direct to consumer school channel total blended yield december direct to consumer school channel total blended yield september direct to consumer school channel total  blended yield fiscal blended yield june direct to consumer school channel total blended yield march direct to consumer school channel total blended yield october direct to consumer school channel total  blended yield fiscal blended yield includes total principal and accrued interest balance of loans securitized in separate transactions involving the national collegiate student loan trust and the national collegiate student loan trust 
table of contents blended yield represents securitization revenues as a percentage of the total principal and accrued interest balance of the loans securitized from all marketing channels at the date of securitization 
due to rounding and the complex nature of these calculations  which involve allocating the total revenue for a securitization across the different marketing channels based on the aggregate profitability of each marketing channel  the total yield by marketing channel and securitization may not represent the sum of the individual yields by revenue source 
these yields by marketing channel represent an approximate allocation of revenues and costs based on various estimates and assumptions regarding the relative profitability of these loans  and should be read with caution 
furthermore  these yields are dependent on a number of factors  including the mix of loans between marketing channels that are included in a particular securitization  the average life of loans  which can be impacted by prepayments  the time of year that the loans are securitized and the relative mix of loans from students with various expected terms to graduation  the structure of  and prevailing market conditions at the time of  a securitization  the marketing fees which our clients earn on loans we securitize for them  along with a number of other factors 
therefore  readers are cautioned that the approximated blended yields and yields by marketing channel above may not be indicative of yields that we may be able to achieve in future securitizations 
market demand for private student loan asset backed securities has been volatile  and we believe does not exist for teri guaranteed loans as of august  this volatility  and absence of demand for private student loan asset backed notes  has negatively affected  and will likely continue to negatively affect  the cost and availability of certain financing structures previously utilized in the securitization transactions that we have facilitated  including the issuance of subordinate classes of asset backed securities 
in addition  we are uncertain as of august  whether the fee structure that we have historically used in facilitating securitization transactions will be used in future securitizations 
in particular  market conditions may dictate that we reduce or forgo our up front structural advisory fee in connection with securitizations  if any  that we are able to facilitate in the near term 
up front structural advisory fees the up front component of structural advisory fees decreased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in up front structural advisory fees between fiscal and fiscal was due to a decrease in securitization volume and a decrease in up front structural advisory fees as a percentage of the private label loan volume securitized  or up front structural advisory fee yield 
we facilitated two securitizations during fiscal  each completed during the first fiscal quarter  compared to five securitizations during fiscal the private label securitization trusts that we facilitated in fiscal issued triple b rated securities  resulting in a higher up front structural advisory fee yield compared to the securitization trusts we facilitated in fiscal  which did not issue triple b rated securities 
the increase in up front structural advisory fees between fiscal and fiscal was primarily due to an increase in up front structural advisory fee yield and an increase in securitization volume

the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to the impact of changes we made to the assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of our additional structural advisory fees receivable  particularly increases in our discount  prepayment and default rate assumptions  which more than offset the accretion of discounting inherent in the fair value estimates 
the increase during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the accretion of the discounting inherent in the fair value estimates  offset in part by the impact of an increase in our assumption regarding future prepayments that we used to estimate the fair value of the receivable and the effect of higher prepayment rates than we had estimated would occur during the period

table of contents residuals service revenues from residuals decreased by million  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in service revenues from residuals in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily a result of changes we made to certain assumptions we use to estimate the value of our residuals receivable in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in securitization volume  offset in part by the impact of a higher up front structural advisory fee yield in the fiscal period 
the issuance of triple b rated securities in the private label securitizations completed during fiscal enabled us to increase the up front structural advisory fee yield  but decreased the amount of residuals we expect to receive  from these securitizations 
the increase in service revenues from residuals in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily a result of an increase in securitization volume  the positive impact of accretion of the discounting inherent in the fair value estimates due to the passage of time and a decrease in the discount rate assumption we used to value the residual receivable for certain securitization trusts  offset in part by the impact of a higher up front structural advisory fee yield in fiscal compared to fiscal and an increase in our assumption for future prepayments that we used to value the residual receivable during fiscal the following table reflects the changes in residuals attributable to the changes in securitization volume  changes in the fee yield and loan mix  and the updates to prior trusts for the years ended june   and residuals fiscal year total volume of loans securitized change attributable to change in securitization volume change attributable to change in yield and loan mix change attributable to trust updates total change in thousands the following table summarizes the changes in our estimate of the fair value of the residuals receivable for the years ended june   and in thousands fair value at beginning of period additions from new securitizations trust updates passage of time present value accretion assumption changes increase in timing and average prepayment rate increase in discount rate increase decrease in timing and average default rate increase in auction rate note spread teri s inability to pay claims increase in delinquency and collection costs other factors net change from trust updates fair value at end of period

our estimates of the fair value of our residuals receivable resulted in a decrease in their aggregate carrying value of approximately million in fiscal and an increase of million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due primarily to the impact of changes we made to the assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of our residuals receivable  particularly  a change in our assumption relating to teri s inability to pay guaranty claims from its general reserves  an increase in our projected cost of funding of auction rate notes and an increase in our discount rate assumption 
the negative impact of these changes to our assumptions  between fiscal and fiscal  more than offset the positive impact of the passage of time 
for a discussion of our decision during fiscal to change the assumptions we use to estimate the fair value of our residual receivable  see executive summary application of critical accounting policies and estimates service revenue and receivables 
during fiscal  the positive impact of the passage of time and the decrease in our discount rate assumption was offset by the net negative impact of changes to the prepayment assumptions we used to estimate the fair value of this receivable as well as the negative impact of other factors  including the negative impact of a higher rate of prepayments during the fiscal than we had estimated would occur 
processing fees from teri processing fees from teri decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal processing fees from teri were million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the impact of the teri reorganization  which partially offset increased reimbursable expenses required to process an increased volume of loans that we actively disbursed during fiscal compared to fiscal the volume of private label loans we actively disbursed increased to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal our inability to access the securitization markets  together with the teri reorganization  resulted in termination or suspension of a number of our clients private loan programs during fiscal  including the programs of jpmorgan chase  bank of america and rbs 
in addition  we expect the loan origination agreements or guaranty agreement that teri has with a significant number of our other clients to be terminated in the context of the teri reorganization 
as a result  we expect to lose additional clients in the future as the teri reorganization evolves  which would result in decreased facilitated loan volumes 
in june  in the context of the teri reorganization  the bankruptcy court entered an order approving a motion by teri to reject the master servicing agreement  pursuant to which we received processing fees from teri 
as a result of the order  the master servicing agreement was terminated effective may   and we will not receive processing fees from teri pursuant to the master servicing agreement for any period after may  in addition  we have a general unsecured claim with regard to million of processing fees from teri that were due  but unpaid  prior to the filing of teri s bankruptcy petition 
effective june   we began receiving a decreased level of fees from teri pursuant to a transition services agreement  which will terminate on september  we expect to receive approximately  to  per month pursuant to the transition services 
table of contents agreement during its term  although teri has the right to terminate any specific service provided pursuant to the transition services agreement upon business days notice to us 
we do not expect to receive any processing fees from teri after such date 
processing fees from teri increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased reimbursable expenses required to process the increased volume of private label loans that we actively disbursed during fiscal the volume of private label loans we actively disbursed increased to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal administrative and other fees administrative and other fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased reimbursed expenses that we generated between periods from marketing coordination services provided to some of our clients and marketing fees earned by us from the securitization of our proprietary brand loans 
to a lesser extent  the increase was due to increasing student loan balances in the securitization trusts during fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal we generated approximately million in marketing fees and reimbursable expenses from marketing coordination services in fiscal  compared to approximately million in marketing fees and reimbursable expenses from marketing coordination services in fiscal and million in marketing fees and reimbursable expenses from marketing coordination services in fiscal we earned administrative fees for the daily management of the securitization trusts of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal net interest income net interest income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increases were primarily due to higher average cash balances available for investment and net interest income earned by our subsidiary  union federal  of million during fiscal and million during fiscal net interest income earned by union federal was primarily derived from student loans held for sale during fiscal and fiscal

in february  we announced a reduction in our overall cost structure on an annualized basis by approximately to percent  including a reduction in headcount by employees 
as a result of the expected reduction in facilitated loan volumes resulting from the teri reorganization  we took significant further steps to reduce our expense structure 
in may  we reduced headcount by approximately additional employees  which coupled with other cost saving initiatives  is expected to result in further cost savings on an annualized basis of approximately million 
following these reductions  we had full time employees as of june  compared to  full time employees as of june  general and administrative expenses increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal as a result of increases in several categories of expenses 
marketing expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in marketing expense was primarily due to the increased media costs related to increased advertising efforts  as well as the recognition of approximately million of deferred marketing costs and approximately million of payments to marketer clients due during fiscal equipment expenses were million in each of fiscal and fiscal  an increase from million in fiscal depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to the expansion of our loan processing operations  which 
table of contents resulted in additional purchases of fixed assets as well as the amortization of capitalized software development costs 
professional fees increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to an increase in legal costs 
outsourced operations expense increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase is primarily due to increases in temporary employment and external call center costs necessary to process the increasing volume of loans facilitated between periods and the expansion of our marketing support efforts in the television medium that needed call center support during the first half of fiscal we expect a decline in marketing coordination expenses during fiscal as a result of decreased marketing activity by our client base  in particular decreased television advertisement requiring call center support 
in april  we announced that rbs had terminated a substantial number of agreements pursuant to which we provide marketing coordination services to education loan marketers 
other expenses increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of increases in several categories of expenses 
during fiscal  we paid an affiliate of goldman  sachs co 
approximately million in fees related to a commitment to provide a warehouse line of credit 
we also recorded a valuation adjustment of approximately million during fiscal relating to the portfolio of variable rate education loans held for sale by union federal 
loans held for sale are carried at the lower of cost or aggregate market value 
during fiscal  we also expensed approximately million of certain origination related fees paid by union federal to teri that we determined may not be recoverable from cash generated by future securitizations  and we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million related to the goodwill recorded as part of our transaction with teri in income tax expense benefit income tax benefit increased to million in fiscal from income tax expense of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in income tax benefit was primarily the result of a decrease in the amount of income before income tax expense between periods 
during fiscal  our effective tax rate  or the income tax expense benefit as a percentage of income before income tax expense  decreased to from an effective tax rate of for fiscal our effective tax rate was in fiscal the decrease in our effective tax rate between fiscal and fiscal was primarily due to the change in the relative sources of total revenues 
our up front structural advisory fees decreased and our residual revenues  which have a lower effective tax rate  were a greater proportion of our loss before taxes during fiscal as compared to fiscal in fiscal  our effective tax rate increased to from an effective tax rate of for fiscal  primarily due to the change in the relative sources of total revenues as our up front structural advisory fees increased and our residual revenues decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our liquidity requirements have historically consisted of capital expenditures  working capital  business development expenses  costs associated with alternative financing transactions  general corporate expenses  repurchases of our common stock  quarterly cash dividends and potential acquisitions 
in order to preserve capital and maximize liquidity in challenging market conditions  our board of directors has eliminated the regular quarterly cash dividend for the foreseeable future 
in addition  we do not expect to repurchase shares of common stock for the foreseeable future 
finally  in fiscal  we reduced our overall cost structure on an annualized basis by approximately percent  including reduction of marketing coordination and operational expenses 
for the months of june and july  our cash spend from operations has averaged approximately million per month 

table of contents short term funding requirements we expect to fund our short term liquidity requirements through cash flow from operations  cash and cash equivalents  the closing of the sale of preferred stock to affiliates of gscp  and  subject to disposition of its current portfolio of student loans  various sources of funding that may be available to union federal to finance education loans 
our business has been and continues to be adversely impacted by the current abs market dynamics  including an inability to access the securitization market and interim financing facilities 
we did not complete a securitization transaction during the second  third or fourth quarters of fiscal  and we do not expect to complete a securitization in the first quarter of fiscal our securitization volumes materially decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal  and we expect pricing terms in future securitizations to be substantially less favorable than in the past 
our inability to generate up front structural advisory fees has eroded our short term liquidity position 
historically  teri reimbursed us monthly for the expenses we incurred in providing outsourcing services to teri pursuant to our master servicing agreement 
as a result  teri reimbursed us for a significant portion of our operating expenses 
on june   in the context of the teri reorganization  the bankruptcy court entered an order approving a motion by teri to reject the master servicing agreement 
as a result of the order  the master servicing agreement was terminated  and we will not receive processing fees from teri pursuant to the master servicing agreement for any period subsequent to may  we recently received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million from the sale of preferred stock 
in december  an affiliate of gscp invested million to acquire preferred stock convertible into million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
in addition  affiliates of gscp agreed to invest  upon receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and determinations and satisfaction of other conditions  up to million to acquire additional shares of convertible preferred stock 
the total investment by affiliates of gscp  including the initial investment of million  was capped by the terms of the investment agreement at an amount equal to percent of our total stockholders equity  consistent with regulations of the ots 
as a result of a decrease in our stockholders equity since the time of the initial investment  the affiliates of gscp were limited to investing up to approximately million in connection with their subsequent equity investment  which closed on august  the shares of preferred stock purchased in august are convertible into million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
our short term funding needs depended in large part on the successful closing of the investment 
in july  ufsb private loan spv llc  or ufsb spv  entered into a million education loan warehouse facility with a conduit lender to fund the purchase of education loans from union federal 
at june   million was outstanding 
under the facility  ufsb spv pledges the purchased education loans as collateral for the advances it receives from the conduit lender 
the teri reorganization  and subsequent teri ratings downgrades  resulted in events of termination under the indenture relating to the facility 
as a result  the facility termination date was declared  ufsb spv is not eligible for further borrowings under the facility and the conduit lender may elect to accelerate payment of such notes 
in april  ufsb spv entered into a letter agreement pursuant to which it agreed to pay higher rates of fees to the conduit lender in consideration for an acknowledgement by the conduit lender that interest on the notes issued under the facility would not be payable based on an alternative rate set forth in the indenture  or the default rate  unless and until the conduit lender delivered further notice to ufsb spv 
the conduit lender may elect for interest on outstanding notes to become payable at the default rate for periods following delivery of notice of such election  in which case ufsb spv would pay fees at the lower rates in effect prior to the letter agreement 
the facility termination date had been scheduled to occur on july  under the indenture  the facility termination date commences a liquidation period 
table of contents that ends on the date immediately following the later of july  and the date on which the principal and interest on all outstanding notes  and all amounts otherwise payable by ufsb spv in connection with the facility  are paid in full 
in may  an additional event of termination occurred under the indenture relating to the one and three month default ratios on the underlying loan portfolio 
the conduit lender s recourse under the indenture is limited to student loans pledged as collateral 
at june   union federal had equity capital of million and maintained core capital and risk based capital ratios of and  respectively 
the ots has required in the past  and could require in the future  infusions of equity capital from us to union federal  which would erode our liquidity position 
union federal may not pay dividends to us without prior approval of the ots and may not be permitted to originate private student loans in the future without additional infusions of equity capital from us 
long term funding requirements we expect to fund our business through cash flow from operations and through issuances of common stock  promissory notes or other securities 
we expect to assess our financing alternatives periodically and access the capital markets opportunistically 
if our existing resources are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we were to enter into a strategic arrangement with another company  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities 
any sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional public or private financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  we may be required to further delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more aspects of our operational activities  which could harm our business 
our actual liquidity and capital funding requirements may depend on a number of factors  including the extent to which our services  including services that we have recently developed for non teri guaranteed loan programs  gain market acceptance and remain competitive  the timing  size  structure and terms of any securitization or other funding transactions that we structure  as well as the composition of the loan pool being securitized  the amount and timing of receipt of additional structural advisory fees and residuals  our operating and information systems needs  particularly increased operating expenses that are not reimbursable by teri  regulatory capital requirements applicable to union federal  damages that we may owe former clients as a result of a failure to securitize their loans  the timing and magnitude of income tax payments  the extent to which we repurchase shares of our common stock or pay cash dividends to our stockholders  and the availability of student loans or grants through federal programs 
treasury stock we had treasury stock of million at june  and million at june  our treasury stock balance was primarily derived from the repurchases of our common stock in open market transactions 
treasury stock also includes shares of our stock withheld from employees to satisfy 
table of contents statutory minimum withholding obligations as equity compensation awards vest 
as of june   we had repurchased an aggregate of million shares at an average price  excluding commissions  of per share  under various repurchase programs approved by our board of directors 
on april   our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock 
the million shares authorized for repurchase included million shares available for repurchase as of april  under a previously authorized repurchase program 
as of june   we had repurchased an aggregate of million shares at an average price  excluding commissions  of per share  under the repurchase program approved by the board of directors on april  at june   a maximum of million shares may be repurchased under this repurchase program 
we did not repurchase any shares of common stock pursuant to this program during fiscal cash  cash equivalents  federal funds sold and investments at june  and june   we had million and million  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents  federal funds sold and investments 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and investments is primarily due to cash used to fund operations and payment of cash dividends  offset by cash generated from our september securitization transactions and cash received from the issuance of series a non voting convertible preferred stock to affiliates of gscp 
cash  cash equivalents  federal funds sold and investments at june  and june  primarily included investments in variable rate demand notes  federal home loan bank bonds  funds deposited in taxable or tax exempt money market funds and federal funds sold by our subsidiary  union federal 
loans held for sale our loans held for sale increased to million at june  from million at june  the increase in loans held for sale is due to an increase in education loans originated by our subsidiary  union federal  and the absence of securitization transactions in the second  third and fourth quarters of fiscal our loans held for sale at june  were comprised of education loans 
our loans held for sale at june  were comprised of education and mortgage loans 
service receivables our service receivables decreased to million at june  from million at june   primarily as a result of changes we made to assumptions we use to estimate the value of our residual and additional structural advisory fee receivables 
see executive summary application of critical accounting policies and estimates service revenues and receivables 
the following chart illustrates the pre tax amount and timing of cash flows expected to be released to us from additional structural advisory fees and residuals 
the information presented reflects our trust performance assumptions and undiscounted cash flow estimates from outstanding securitization trusts as of june  see executive summary application of critical accounting policies and estimates service revenue and receivables for a discussion of our key assumptions  including a significant change to our assumptions regarding teri s ability to pay guaranty claims from its general reserves  as well as a sensitivity analysis of hypothetical changes to those assumptions 
you are cautioned that the valuation assumptions require our subjective judgment and are susceptible to change 
we have made in the past  and will likely need to make in the future  adjustments to our valuation assumptions 
the actual cash releases from additional structural advisory fees and residuals that we receive from the trusts  and the actual timing of receipt  could be materially different than reflected in the chart below as a result of variances between the actual performance of the securitization trusts and the assumptions as of june   including assumptions relating to the 
table of contents sufficiency of pledged funds  and the periodic replenishment thereof  and cumulative default rates of the securitization trusts and teri s claims paying ability 
graphic the information above is intended to supplement the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with gaap appearing elsewhere in this annual report 
we have provided the cash flow projections in order to assist investors in assessing our liquidity needs and to provide additional information related to our existing additional structural advisory fees and residuals receivables 
see risk factors under item a of part i of this annual report for additional factors you should consider in evaluating the cash flow projections 
property and equipment  net in fiscal  our property and equipment  net  decreased by million  primarily as a result of million of depreciation expense recorded during the period  offset by million we incurred on the expansion and improvement of our loan processing facilities and systems and the acquisition of million in equipment through capital leases 
prepaid income taxes we had no prepaid income taxes at june  as compared to million at june  at june   this balance was primarily due to a favorable ruling from the internal revenue service regarding the timing of our recognition of additional structural advisory fees as income for tax purposes 
as a result of the ruling  we recognize additional structural advisory fees in our financial statements earlier than they are recognized for income tax purposes 
other prepaid expenses our other prepaid expenses decreased to million at june  from million at june  the decrease in other prepaid expenses was primarily due to a decrease in prepaid marketing expense of approximately million offset by an increase in other prepaid expenses  primarily relating to certain vendor related deferred costs of million 

table of contents other assets other assets decreased to million at june  from million at june  primarily due to a write off related to marketing expenses reflecting capital market conditions and lower receivables relating to collections 
deposits deposits increased to million at june  from million at june  the increase in deposits was primarily due to an increase in brokered deposits at union federal of million 
included in deposits at june  was million of brokered deposits  primarily brokered certificates of deposits issued to fund the disbursement of education loans 
also included in deposits at june  was million in money market deposits 
accounts payable and accrued expenses accounts payable and accrued expenses decreased to million at june  from million at june  incentive compensation accruals decreased by approximately million at june  as compared to june  as a result of the decrease in company profitability for fiscal our accounts payable were million lower at june  as compared to june  primarily as a result of lower processing volumes and expense management efforts 
education loan warehouse facility we had million in borrowings outstanding at june  under the education loan warehouse facility between union federal and a conduit lender 
we had no amounts outstanding under the facility at june   having entered into it in july the facility provided interim financing which we used to fund the disbursement of education loans by union federal 
the teri reorganization  and subsequent teri ratings downgrades  resulted in events of termination under the indenture relating to the facility 
as a result  the facility termination date was declared  ufsb spv is not eligible for further borrowings under the facility and the conduit lender may elect to accelerate payment of such notes

in may  an additional event of termination occurred under the indenture relating to the one and three month default ratios on the underlying loan portfolio 
the conduit lender s recourse under the indenture is limited to student loans pledged as collateral 
income taxes payable we had income taxes payable of million at june  we had no income taxes payable  and a prepaid income tax receivable balance of million  at june  our income taxes payable is primarily due to a higher estimate of taxable income expected to be earned by our ownership of residual interests in securitization trusts then calculated in our estimated tax payments for the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents net deferred income tax liability our net deferred income tax liability decreased to million at june  from million at june  we have a net deferred income tax liability primarily because  under gaap  we recognize additional structural advisory fees and residuals in our financial statements earlier than they are recognized for income tax purposes 
our net deferred income tax liability decreased primarily as a result of the decrease in additional structural advisory fees and residuals receivables at june  and the recognition of our share of taxable income from the securitization trusts 
other liabilities other liabilities increased to million at june  from million at june  other liabilities primarily include our note payable to teri  capital lease obligations and deferred rent related to several operating leases for office space 
the increase in other liabilities is primarily due to an additional million in capital leases  relating to networking and storage equipment  offset by scheduled principal payments made during fiscal on our note payable to teri and capital lease obligations 
contractual obligations in addition to our notes payable to teri  we have future cash obligations under various types of contracts 
we lease office space and office equipment under long term operating and capital leases

off balance sheet transactions we offer outsourcing services in connection with private student loan programs  from origination  program design and marketing coordination through loan administration and  ultimately  to the sale and securitization of the loans 
we have structured and facilitated the securitization of student loans for our clients through a series of bankruptcy remote  qualified special purpose trusts 
the principal uses of these trusts have been to generate sources of liquidity for our clients and union federal s assets sold into such trusts and make available more funds to students and colleges

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 fair value measurements  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the statement also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas no 
applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
under sfas no 
 fair value refers to the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
sfas no 
clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  the reporting entity s own data 
fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the statement permits entities to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risks related to cash  cash equivalents and investments we have market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates applicable to our cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we manage our market risk through a conservative investment policy  the primary objective of which is preservation of capital 
at june   cash  cash equivalents and investments consisted primarily of investments in seven day variable rate demand notes and money market funds 
cash  cash equivalents and investments at june  and june  primarily included investments in variable rate demand notes  federal home loan bank bonds  funds deposited in taxable or tax exempt money market funds and federal funds sold by union federal  all of which were due on demand or within one year 
as a result  we do not believe a change in interest rate would have a material impact on the fair value of cash  cash equivalents and investments 
risks related to loans held for sale and deposits we also have market risk exposure related to our loans held for sale and deposits 
our loans held for sale at june  consisted of million in education loans originated by union federal 
our loans held for sale are recorded at lower of cost or fair value and as a result of their variable interest rates  are not subject to interest rate sensitivity 
under gaap  we would be required to reduce the carrying value of our education loans if their fair value decreases below our cost 
in such an event  we would be required to write down the carrying value of our education loans and may be required to provide additional regulatory capital to union federal 
at june   our student loans had an average interest rate of approximately 
all of our education loans and approximately of our mortgage loans have variable interest rates 
we held deposits of million at june  our deposits are recorded at the amount owed 
our deposit balances are subject to changes in economic value based on varying market conditions  primarily changes in the levels of interest rates 
at june   our deposits had an average interest rate of approximately 
less than of our deposits have fixed interest rates in excess of months 
approximately of our deposits have fixed interest rates of months or less 
we do not believe a change in interest rates would have a material impact on the fair value of our loans held for sale or deposits since the majority of these assets and liabilities carry interest rates that are variable and any loss we may incur would not be material relative to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents risk related to structural advisory fees and residuals because there are no quoted market prices for our additional structural advisory fees and residuals receivables  we use discounted cash flow modeling techniques and various assumptions to estimate their values 
we base these estimates on our proprietary historical data  third party data and our industry experience  adjusting for specific program and borrower characteristics such as loan type and borrower creditworthiness 
we also monitor trends in loan performance over time and make adjustments we believe are necessary to value properly our receivables balances at each balance sheet date 
because our estimates rely on quantitative and qualitative factors  including macroeconomic indicators to predict prepayment  default and recovery rates  management s ability to determine which factors are relevant to our estimates  and our ability to accurately incorporate those factors into our estimates  can have a material effect on our valuations 
our assumptions regarding teri s ability to pay claims on defaulted loans affects the expected timing of cash payments to us in respect of additional structural advisory fees and residuals  which in turn affects our estimates of their fair value 
if we were to determine that recoveries with respect to a trust s defaulted student loans would be unavailable to replenish the trust s pledged fund  the estimated value of our additional structural advisory fees and residuals would be reduced 
in addition  increases in our estimates of defaults  prepayments and discount rates  increases in the spread between libor indices and auction rates  as well as decreases in default recovery rates and the multi year forward estimates of the libor rate  which is the reference rate for the loan assets and borrowings of the securitization trusts  would have a negative effect on the value of our additional structural advisory fees and residuals
