table of contents significant activity i distributors of our dental products have undergone consolidation during fiscal  which adversely impacted sales of our healthcare disposables segment in fiscal due to the loss of some private label business  and with respect to our first quarter of fiscal and our fourth quarter of fiscal  rationalization of duplicate inventories in the consolidated companies 
we cannot predict what impact consolidation in this industry will have on future sales of our healthcare disposable products 
ii higher raw material  manufacturing and distribution costs adversely impacted our results of operations in fiscal  compared with fiscal  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
iii we sell our dialysis products to a concentrated number of customers 
sales in our dialysis segment were adversely impacted during our fourth quarter of fiscal and will continue to be adversely impacted during fiscal due to the loss of some low margin dialysate concentrate business as a result of the highly competitive and price sensitive market for such product  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
iv effective april   our former president and chief executive officer resigned and our chief operating officer and executive vice president was promoted to president 
as a result of this resignation  a charge of approximately  primarily relating to separation benefits was recorded  which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately in fiscal  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
v in june  we announced and began executing our plan to restructure our netherlands manufacturing operations as part of our continuing effort to reduce operating costs and leverage our existing united states infrastructure 
as a result of this restructuring  a charge of approximately  was recorded during the fourth quarter  which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by in fiscal an additional charge of approximately  is expected in fiscal  as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this md a 
vi a stronger canadian dollar and euro against the united states dollar adversely impacted our results of operations during fiscal  compared with fiscal  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
the increase in values of the canadian dollar and euro were approximately and  respectively  compared with fiscal  based upon average exchange rates reported by banking institutions 
vii fiscal acquisitions we acquired the businesses of dialysis services  inc dsi on august   verimetrix  llc verimetrix on september   and strong dental products  inc strong dental on september   as more fully described in business fiscal acquisitions and note to the consolidated financial statements 
viii fiscal acquisitions we acquired ge water process technologies water dialysis business the ge water acquisition or ge water on march  and the business of twist it inc twist on july   as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
ix fiscal acquisitions we acquired crosstex international inc crosstex on august  and the business of fluid solutions  inc fsi on may   as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
x the olympus distribution agreements with carsen group inc carsen  as well as carsen s active business operations  terminated on july   as more fully described elsewhere in this md a and note to the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  carsen is reported as a discontinued operation for all years presented 

table of contents results of operations the results of operations reflect the continuing operating results of cantel and its wholly owned subsidiaries  but exclude the operating results of carsen 
since the ge water and twist acquisitions were completed on march  and july   respectively  their results of operations are included in our results of operations for fiscal and the portion of fiscal subsequent to their respective acquisition dates and are not reflected in our results of operations for fiscal the acquisitions of dsi  verimetrix and strong dental had an overall insignificant effect on our results of operations for fiscal since their respective acquisition dates due to the small size of these businesses 
their results of operations are not reflected in our results of operations for fiscal and the distribution agreements between olympus america inc and certain of its affiliates collectively  olympus and our wholly owned subsidiary  carsen  as well as carsen s active business operations  terminated on july   as more fully described elsewhere in this md a and note to the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  carsen is reported as a discontinued operation for fiscals  and for fiscal compared with fiscal  and fiscal compared with fiscal  discussion herein of our pre existing business refers to all of our reporting segments with the exception of the operating results of the ge water acquisition included in our water purification and filtration reporting segment  as well as the discontinued operations of carsen 
the following table gives information as to the net sales from continuing operations and the percentage to the total net sales from continuing operations for each of our reporting segments 
year ended july  dollar amounts in thousands water purification and filtration dialysis healthcare disposables endoscope reprocessing all other fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal net sales of our pre existing business increased by  or  to  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal net sales contributed by the ge water acquisition in fiscal and were  and  respectively 
net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of euro net sales primarily of our endoscope reprocessing and dialysis operating segments using a stronger euro against the united states dollar 
in addition  net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of canadian dollar net sales primarily of our water purification and filtration operating segment using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
although net sales in all of our reporting segments increased in fiscal  the increase in net sales of our pre existing business in fiscal was principally attributable to increases in sales of endoscope reprocessing products and services and water purification and filtration products and services 

table of contents net sales of endoscope reprocessing products and services increased by in fiscal  compared with fiscal  primarily due to i an increase in demand for our endoscope disinfection equipment and disinfectants both internationally and in the united states and product service in the united states  ii approximately  in incremental net sales in fiscal due to the acquisition of verimetrix on september   and iii approximately  in higher net sales due to an increase in selling prices of our medivators endoscope reprocessing equipment and related products and service in the united states as a result of selling directly to our customers and not through a distributor 
beginning in our second quarter of fiscal  we commenced the sale of equipment directly to our customers in the united states 
although this distributor continued to purchase high level disinfectants  cleaners  and consumables from us and provide product service to our customers during fiscals and  we have been gradually converting the sale of such items to our direct sales and service force at higher selling prices 
the increase in demand for our disinfectants and product service is also attributable to the increased field population of equipment and our ability to convert users of competitive disinfectants to our products 
net sales of water purification and filtration products and services from our pre existing business increased by in fiscal compared with fiscal  primarily due to an increase in demand for our water purification equipment from dialysis customers as well as an increase in service revenue from the improved density and efficiency of our pre existing service delivery network partially due to recent acquisitions 
this increase was partially offset in fiscal by a decrease in commercial and industrial large capital equipment sales as a result of i our decision made in early fiscal to refocus our efforts on selling large capital equipment with standardized designs instead of customized designs that have historically provided lower profitability and ii delayed investments in capital equipment by customers due to the softening of the united states economy 
increases in selling prices of our water purification products and services did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal with respect to ge water  which is excluded from the above discussion of our pre existing business  average quarterly sales of water purification and filtration products and services in fiscal were approximately higher when compared with the post acquisition period ended july   due to improved sales opportunities within the installed equipment base of business as a result of combining ge water with our pre existing water purification and filtration business 
net sales of dialysis products and services increased by in fiscal  compared with fiscal  primarily due to i increased demand during the first nine months of fiscal from customers  both in the united states and internationally  for dialysate concentrate a concentrated acid or bicarbonate used to prepare dialysate  a chemical solution that draws waste products from a patient s blood through a dialyzer membrane during hemodialysis treatment and ii higher selling prices primarily on dialysate concentrate  including freight invoiced to customers related costs of a similar amount are included within cost of sales  to partially offset increased manufacturing and shipping costs 
this increase in net sales was partially offset by a decrease of approximately  or  in net sales of dialysate concentrate during the three months ended july   compared with the three months ended july   due to the loss of some dialysate concentrate business as a result of the highly competitive and price sensitive market for this low margin commodity product 
due to sales price decreases by some of our competitors  we expect a similar decrease in net sales of our low margin dialysate concentrate product throughout fiscal as we elect not to pursue unprofitable concentrate sales 
net sales of healthcare disposable products increased by in fiscal  compared with fiscal  primarily due to i an increase in demand during the second half of fiscal for our instrument sterilization pouches  cups  towels and face mask products  ii approximately  in incremental net sales in fiscal due to the acquisitions of strong dental on september  and twist on july  and iii approximately  in higher net sales due to an increase in selling prices 
such selling price increases were implemented to offset corresponding supplier cost increases and therefore did not have a significant impact on gross profit 
partially offsetting these increases in net sales were i a high level of demand during the first three months of fiscal for face mask products due to a heightened awareness of avian flu prevention and ii distributors of our dental products had undergone consolidation during  which has adversely impacted sales of our healthcare disposables segment in fiscal due to the loss of some private label business  and with respect to the first three months of fiscal and our fourth quarter of fiscal  rationalization of duplicate inventories in the consolidated companies 
net sales contributed by the therapeutic filtration operating segment were  an increase of  in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in sales in fiscal was primarily due to the recommencement in february of sales of filters manufactured by us on an oem basis for a single customer s hydration system 
this customer had previously experienced a voluntary recall of the system unrelated to our product and was not purchasing filters until their sales of hydration systems recommenced 
increases in selling prices of our therapeutic filtration products did not have a significant effect on net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal 
table of contents net sales contributed by the specialty packaging operating segment were  a decrease of  in fiscal compared with fiscal this decrease in sales was primarily due to decreased customer demand in the united states for our compliance training products due to the timing of orders relating to the government mandated two year compliance certification period  partially offset by increases in selling prices of approximately  gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit of our pre existing business increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit contributed by the ge water acquisition in fiscal and for the four month period ended july  since the date of the acquisition was  and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals and was and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales of our pre existing business in fiscals and was and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the ge water acquisition in fiscal and for the four month period ended july  since the date of the acquisition was and  respectively 
the gross profit percentage of our pre existing business in fiscal decreased compared with fiscal primarily due to i a change in sales mix  including increases in sales of renalin sterilant to large national chains that typically receive more favorable pricing  and lower margin water purification services  and with respect to the first six months of fiscal a decrease in sales of certain higher margin healthcare disposables products such as face masks  ii an increase in raw material  manufacturing and shipping costs in all of our operating segments  iii unabsorbed manufacturing overhead due to the decrease in commercial and industrial large capital equipment sales in our water purification and filtration segment  iv inefficiencies in our water purification and filtration segment as a result of the integration of the ge water acquisition into our pre existing business  which is now complete  and v approximately  in restructuring charges recorded primarily in our endoscope reprocessing segment in our fourth quarter of fiscal relating to the relocation of our netherlands manufacturing operations  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in gross profit percentage in our endoscope reprocessing segment as a result of selling our medivators brand endoscope reprocessing equipment and related products and service directly to customers through our own united states field sales and service organization instead of through a distributor as was done during a significant portion of the first three months of fiscal additionally  although this distributor continued to purchase high level disinfectants  cleaners  and consumables from us and provide product service to our customers during fiscals and  we have been gradually converting the sale of such high margin items to our direct sales and service force resulting in an increase in gross profit percentage 
with respect to ge water  which is excluded from the above discussion of our pre existing business  the gross profit percentage of water purification and filtration products and services decreased to approximately in fiscal from for the four months ended july  since the date of the acquisition due to increased manufacturing costs 
with respect to the increase in the amount of gross profit as opposed to the discussion of gross profit percentage  increases in net sales as explained above constitute the most significant factor in the increase in gross profit 
operating expenses selling expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to higher compensation expense of approximately  including travel costs primarily relating to increased commissions on increased sales by our endoscope reprocessing direct sales network and additional headcount resulting from the ge water acquisition  an increase of approximately  in advertising and marketing expense primarily related to our healthcare disposables segment  and an increase of approximately  as a result of translating selling expenses of our international subsidiaries using a significantly stronger canadian dollar and euro against the united states dollar 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal increases in selling expenses as explained above constitute the most significant factor in the higher selling expense as a percentage of net sales 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to an increase of approximately  in compensation expense due to additional headcount in our water purification and filtration segment  annual salary increases  severance expense related to the relocation of our medivators 
table of contents manufacturing operations from the netherlands to the united states and incentive compensation relating to the dsi  verimetrix and strong dental acquisitions  an increase of  in amortization expense of intangible assets primarily relating to our acquisitions of ge water  twist  dsi  verimetrix and strong dental  the inclusion of approximately  in estimated separation benefits and other costs related to the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer on april   as more fully described elsewhere in this md a  an increase in stock based compensation expense of  and an increase of approximately  as a result of foreign exchange losses associated with translating certain foreign denominated assets into functional currencies as well as the translation of general and administrative expenses of our international subsidiaries using a significantly stronger canadian dollar and euro against the united states dollar 
partially offsetting these increases was the non reoccurrence of  in incentive compensation directly related to the ge water acquisition  which was incurred during the three months ended april  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal  compared with in fiscal research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs were  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the majority of our research and development expenses related to our mds endoscope reprocessor and specialty filtration products 
the decrease in research and development expense in fiscal  compared with fiscal  is due to less development work on the european version of our mds endoscope reprocessor 
interest interest expense increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to the increase in average outstanding borrowings as a result of financing the purchase prices of the acquisitions of ge water  dsi  verimetrix and strong dental 
interest income decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to a lower average balance of cash and cash equivalents and a decrease in average interest rates 
income from continuing operations before taxes income from continuing operations before income taxes decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in the consolidated effective tax rate was affected principally by the geographic mix of pre tax income and statutory tax rate reductions as described below 
the majority of our income from continuing operations before income taxes is generated from our united states operations  which had an overall effective tax rate in fiscal of 
this low overall effective rate is principally caused by i our combined federal and state statutory tax rate of approximately as applied to current operations and ii recently enacted new york state tax rate reductions as applied to existing deferred income tax liabilities in our healthcare disposables segment 
our canadian operations had an overall effective tax rate in fiscal of  which overall rate was favorably impacted by recently enacted canadian federal tax rate reductions as applied to existing deferred income tax liabilities in the canadian portion of our water purification and filtration business 
a tax benefit was not recorded on the losses from operations at our netherlands subsidiary for fiscals and  thereby causing our overall consolidated effective tax rate to exceed the effective tax rates in our united states and canadian operations 
although we continued to incur an overall loss from our netherlands operation in fiscal  such loss decreased significantly compared to fiscal in fiscal  we will be completing the restructuring of our netherlands operation as described in note to the consolidated financial statements and elsewhere in this md a 
additionally  during fiscal we decided to place a full valuation allowance against the nols of our japanese subsidiary  which resulted in the recording of tax expense on the past losses of our subsidiary in japan 
the results of continuing operations for our subsidiary in singapore did not have a significant impact on our overall effective tax rate for fiscal due to the size of the operation relative to our united states  canada and netherlands operations 

table of contents in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and therefore was adopted on august  the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations since  after the completion of our evaluation  we did not record an increase or decrease to our income taxes payable or deferred tax liabilities related to unrecognized income tax benefits for uncertain tax positions 
we record liabilities for an unrecognized tax benefit when a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  but is not recognized in our consolidated financial statements because it does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold that the uncertain tax position would be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
the majority of our unrecognized tax benefits originated from acquisitions 
accordingly  any adjustments upon resolution of income tax uncertainties that predate or result from acquisitions are recorded as an increase or decrease to goodwill 
therefore  if the unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in our financial statements in future periods  there would not be a significant impact to our effective tax rate on continuing operations 
we do not expect such unrecognized tax benefits to significantly decrease or increase in the next twelve months 
a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows unrecognized tax benefits unrecognized tax benefits on august  lapse of statute of limitations unrecognized tax benefits on july  generally  the company is no longer subject to federal  state or foreign income tax examinations for fiscal years ended prior to july  our policy is to record potential interest and penalties related to income tax positions in interest expense and general and administrative expense  respectively  in our consolidated financial statements 
however  such amounts have been relatively insignificant due to the amount of our unrecognized tax benefits relating to uncertain tax positions 
stock based compensation the following table shows the income statement components of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income year ended july  cost of sales operating expenses selling general and administrative research and development total operating expenses discontinued operations stock based compensation before income taxes income tax benefits total stock based compensation expense  net of tax the above stock based compensation expense before income taxes was recorded in the consolidated financial statements as stock based compensation expense which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share from net income by  
table of contents and in fiscals  and  respectively and an increase to additional capital 
the related income tax benefits which pertain only to stock awards and options that do not qualify as incentive stock options were recorded as an increase to long term deferred income tax assets which are netted with long term deferred income tax liabilities or a reduction to income taxes payable  depending on the timing of the deduction  and a reduction to income tax expense 
the stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effect of stock based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years which level may not be similar in the future  assumptions used in determining fair value  and estimated forfeitures 
we determine the fair value of each stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the determination of fair value using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected option life which is determined by using the historical closing prices of our common stock  the expected dividend yield which is expected to be  and the expected option life which is based on historical exercise behavior 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we would record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
most of our stock option and stock awards which consist only of restricted shares are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
at july   total unrecognized stock based compensation expense  net of tax  related to total nonvested stock options and stock awards was  with a remaining weighted average period of months over which such expense is expected to be recognized 
if certain criteria are met when options are exercised  or with respect to incentive stock options the underlying shares are sold  the company is allowed a deduction on its income tax return 
accordingly  we account for the income tax effect on such income tax deductions as additional capital assuming deferred tax assets do not exist pertaining to the exercised stock options and as a reduction of income taxes payable 
in fiscals and  options exercised resulted in income tax deductions that reduced income taxes payable by  and  respectively 
we classify the cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits as financing cash flows on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
excess tax benefits arise when the ultimate tax effect of the deduction for tax purposes is greater than the tax benefit on stock compensation expense including tax benefits on stock compensation expense that has only been reflected in past pro forma disclosures relating to fiscal years prior to august  which was determined based upon the award s fair value 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal net sales of our pre existing business increased by  or  to  in fiscal compared with fiscal net sales contributed by the ge water acquisition in fiscal were  net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of euro net sales primarily of our endoscope reprocessing and dialysis operating segments using a stronger euro against the united states dollar 
in addition  net sales were positively impacted in fiscal compared with fiscal by approximately  due to the translation of canadian dollar net sales primarily of our water purification and filtration operating segment using a stronger canadian dollar against the united states dollar 
the increase in net sales of our pre existing business in fiscal was principally attributable to increases in sales of endoscope reprocessing products and services  water purification and filtration products and services  healthcare disposable products  specialty packaging products and therapeutic filtration products 

table of contents net sales of endoscope reprocessing products and services increased by in fiscal  compared with fiscal  primarily due to an increase in selling prices of our medivators endoscope reprocessing equipment and related products and service in the united states as a result of selling directly to our customers and not through a distributor  as more fully described elsewhere in this md a  and an increase in demand for our endoscope disinfection equipment in europe and disinfectants and product service both in the united states and internationally 
the increase in demand for our disinfectants and product service is attributable to the increased field population of equipment and our ability to convert users of competitive disinfectants to our products 
the increase in customer prices as a result of the direct sales effort increased sales by approximately  in fiscal  compared with fiscal net sales of water purification and filtration products and services from our pre existing business increased by in fiscal  compared with fiscal  primarily due to the acquisition of fluid solutions on may   which contributed approximately  of incremental net sales in fiscal in early fiscal  a decision was made to refocus the consumer and industrial large capital portion of the water purification and filtration equipment business by eliminating contracts with low profitability  as such  revenue growth in this segment for the total year was moderated by this activity 
net sales of healthcare disposable products increased by in fiscal  compared with fiscal  primarily due to increased demand in the united states for our face masks and instrument sterilization pouches  and increases in selling prices of approximately  such selling price increases were implemented to offset corresponding supplier cost increases and therefore did not have a significant impact on gross profit 
net sales contributed by the specialty packaging operating segment were  an increase of  in fiscal compared with fiscal this increase in sales was primarily due to increased customer demand in the united states for our specialty packaging and compliance training products and increases in selling prices of approximately  there can be no assurance that the sales growth of specialty packaging products in fiscal will be comparable with fiscal net sales contributed by the therapeutic filtration operating segment were  an increase of  in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in sales in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in demand internationally for our hemoconcentrator products a device used to concentrate red blood cells and remove excess fluid from the bloodstream during open heart surgery and the recommencement of sales of filters manufactured by us on an oem basis for a single customer s hydration system 
this customer had previously experienced a voluntary recall of the system unrelated to our product and was not purchasing filters until their sales of hydration systems recommenced  there can be no assurance that future sales of such filters will continue at current levels 
sales of dialysis products and services in fiscal were comparable with fiscal such sales decreased primarily due to lower average selling prices for renalin sterilant and renatron equipment due to increased sales to large national chains that typically receive more favorable pricing  and reduced demand for renalin sterilant domestically primarily due to the acquisition of renal care group rcg by fresenius medical care fresenius  as discussed below 
offsetting this decrease was an increase in customer demand for renatron equipment  both in the united states and internationally  and dialysate concentrate a concentrated acid or bicarbonate used to prepare dialysate  a chemical solution that draws waste products from a patient s blood through a dialyzer membrane during hemodialysis treatment internationally partially offset by decreased demand for concentrate in the united states  as well as an increase of approximately  in net sales as a result of shipping and handling fees  such as freight  invoiced to customers in fiscal related costs of a similar amount are included within cost of sales 
the majority of this amount related to two of our larger customers who were previously responsible for transportation related to the products they purchased from us  during fiscal  we became responsible for the transportation and invoiced them for such costs 
the dialysis industry has undergone significant consolidation through the acquisition by certain major dialysis chains of other major chains  as well as smaller chains and independents 
in october  davita inc davita  the second largest dialysis chain in the united states  acquired gambro ab s united states dialysis clinic business  gambro healthcare  inc gambro us 
davita gambro us are significant customers of our dialysis reuse products and accounted for approximately and of our dialysis net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the davita gambro us acquisition has resulted in greater buying power for the larger resulting entity and thereby a reduction in our net sales and profit margins due to reduced average selling prices of our dialyzer reprocessing products beginning in november  however  offsetting this reduction is increased demand for our renatron equipment and renalin sterilant from davita gambro in fiscal  as compared with fiscal 
table of contents in addition  on march   fresenius  the largest dialysis chain in the united states and a provider of single use dialyzer products  completed its acquisition of rcg  which was a significant customer of our dialysis reuse products 
combined net sales of fresenius and rcg accounted for approximately and of our dialysis net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
we believe fresenius has converted most of the dialysis clinics of rcg into single use facilities  which has adversely affected our sales of reuse dialysis products 
in addition  the fresenius acquisition has resulted in the loss of low margin concentrate business to the rcg dialysis centers since fresenius manufactures dialysate concentrate 
we believe that the majority of the adverse impact of these acquisitions has already occurred and is therefore reflected in the operating results of our dialysis segment for the last nine months of fiscal gross profit gross profit increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal gross profit of our pre existing business increased by  or  to  in fiscal compared with fiscal gross profit contributed by the ge water acquisition for the four month period ended july  was  since the date of the acquisition 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscals and was and  respectively 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales of our pre existing business in fiscal was 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the ge water acquisition for the four month period ended july  was since the date of the acquisition 
the higher gross profit percentage of our pre existing business in fiscal  compared with fiscal  was primarily attributable to an increase in gross profit percentage on our dialysis products due to i an improvement in both customer and product mix related to our dialysate concentrate product  which improvements resulted from the fresenius acquisition of rcg and our strategy of only maintaining concentrate business with an acceptable gross margin  ii lower manufacturing costs including the closing of a distribution center and iii more favorable transportation costs due to new freight arrangements with certain customers 
the increase in gross profit percentage was also attributable to selling our medivators brand endoscope reprocessing equipment  high level disinfectants  cleaners and consumables directly to customers through our own united states field sales and service organization instead of through a distributor  increases in sales of higher margin healthcare disposable products  such as our face masks and instrument sterilization pouches  and specialty packaging products  and the non reoccurrence of a  one time purchase accounting charge related to our healthcare disposables segment s inventory incurred during the first quarter of fiscal partially offsetting these increases in gross profit percentage were a lower gross profit percentage due to i mds integration costs including material  overhead and warranty costs and increased international sales of our low margin mds product line of endoscope reprocessing equipment  ii endoscope reprocessing services primarily due to a low level of billable time for our newly developed us field service organization since most machines sold directly to our customers under our new direct sales and service strategy are still under warranty and iii water purification and filtration products and services primarily due to unabsorbed manufacturing overhead  as well as the sale of water purification equipment at lower than normal margins due to start up costs of a new line of machines 
with respect to the increase in gross profit as opposed to gross profit percentage  increases in net sales as explained above  as well as the aforementioned reasons for the increase in gross profit percentage  constitute the most significant factors in the increase in gross profit 
operating expenses selling expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal principally due to a higher cost structure of approximately  for our endoscope reprocessing direct sales network as a result of our decision to not renew olympus exclusive united states distribution agreement when it expired on august   the inclusion of approximately  of selling expenses related to the acquisitions of ge water and fluid solutions  an increase in advertising and marketing expense primarily related to our healthcare disposables and endoscope reprocessing segments  and an increase in compensation expense primarily due to additional sales and marketing personnel in our specialty packaging and healthcare disposables segments 
selling expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal compared with in fiscal the increase in selling expenses as a percentage of net sales was primarily attributable to a higher cost structure for our endoscope reprocessing direct sales network as a result of our decision to not renew olympus exclusive united states distribution agreement when it expired on august  
table of contents general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal principally due to increased compensation expense  including additional personnel  of approximately  the inclusion of approximately  of expenses related to the acquisitions of ge water and fluid solutions  increased accounting and other professional fees including executive transition expenses of approximately  an increase in stock based compensation expense of   in higher medical insurance costs  and  in incentive compensation directly related to the ge water acquisition 
partially offsetting these increases were the non reoccurrences of  in incentive compensation directly related to the crosstex acquisition and  in debt financing costs related to our amended and restated credit facilities  both of which charges were incurred during the first three months of fiscal general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were in fiscal  compared with in fiscal research and development expenses which include continuing engineering costs were  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the majority of our research and development expenses related to our mds endoscope reprocessor and specialty filtration products 
the decrease in research and development expense in fiscal  compared with fiscal  is due to less development work on the european version of our mds endoscope reprocessor 
interest interest expense decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due a decrease in average outstanding borrowings  partially offset by an increase in average interest rates 
interest expense specifically related to the financing of the ge water acquisition was  since the date of the acquisition 
interest income decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to a decrease in average cash and cash equivalents partially offset by an increase in average interest rates 
income from continuing operations before taxes income from continuing operations before income taxes increased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal income taxes the consolidated effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
our results of continuing operations for fiscal and reflect income tax expense for our united states  canada and japan operations at their respective statutory rates  which rates in fiscal were  and  respectively 
however  only a partial tax benefit was recorded in fiscal and at our netherlands subsidiary  thereby causing our overall effective tax rate to exceed statutory rates 
the decrease in the overall effective tax rate for fiscal  compared with fiscal  was principally due to the geographic mix of pretax income  particularly in our fourth quarter of this decrease was also attributable to a reduction in the statutory united states tax rate to in fiscal  compared with in fiscal in fiscal  we believe our consolidated effective tax rate will be approximately

cash flows from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
with respect to continuing operations only  net cash provided by operating activities was   and  for fiscals  and  respectively 
in fiscal  the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense and deferred income taxes  a decrease in accounts receivable due to improved collections and an increase in income taxes payable due to timing associated with payments  partially offset by increases in inventories due to planned increases in stock levels of certain products primarily in our endoscope reprocessing and healthcare disposables segments and prepaid expenses due to the prepayment of certain operating expenses primarily relating to commissions 
in fiscal  the net cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income after adjusting for depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation expense and deferred income taxes  and an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to increased purchases in july to meet product demand and additional compensation as a result of more personnel  including the additional sales and service personnel of our endoscope reprocessing operating segment 
these items were partially offset by increases in i accounts receivable due to strong sales in the months of july and june  including sales related to the ge water acquisition  and increases in customer prices in our endoscope reprocessing operating segment as a result of the direct sales effort and ii inventories due to planned increases in stock levels of certain products and decreases in i net liabilities of discontinued operations due to the wind down of carsen s operations including substantial tax payments that were payable in fiscal and ii income taxes payable due to timing associated with payments

repurchase of shares in may  our board of directors approved the repurchase of up to  shares of our outstanding common stock under a repurchase program commencing on june  under the repurchase program we repurchase shares from time to time at prevailing prices and as permitted by applicable securities laws including sec rule b and new york stock exchange requirements  and subject to market conditions 
the repurchase program has a one year term ending on june  the first repurchase under our repurchase program occurred on july  through july   we completed the repurchase of  shares under the program at a total average price per share of

restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our management approved and initiated plans to restructure our netherlands subsidiary by relocating all of our manufacturing operations from the netherlands to the united states 
this action is part of our continuing effort to reduce operating costs and improve efficiencies by leveraging the existing infrastructure of our minntech operations in minnesota 
the elimination of manufacturing operations in the netherlands will lead to the end of onsite material management  quality assurance  finance and accounting  human resources and some customer service functions 
however  we will continue to maintain a strong marketing  sales  service and technical support presence based in the netherlands to serve customers throughout europe  the middle east and africa 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded  in restructuring expenses  which decreased both basic and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by approximately in fiscal  and expect to incur approximately  in additional restructuring costs in the first half of fiscal any changes to the estimated expenses of executing this restructuring plan will be reflected in our future results of operations 
the majority of the restructuring costs are included in our endoscope reprocessing segment 
the restructuring costs recorded in fiscal in our consolidated financials statements and expected to be recorded in fiscal are as follows three months ended fiscal total july  accrued at expected expected costs inventory disposal july  costs costs cost of sales unsalable inventory severance general and administrative expenses severance other since the above costs are recorded in our netherlands subsidiary  which has been experiencing losses from its operations  tax benefits on the above costs were not recorded 
the unsalable inventory is recorded in inventories as part of 
table of contents our inventory reserve and the accrued severance is recorded in compensation payable in our consolidated balance sheet at july  as part of the restructuring plan  we intend to sell our netherlands building and land 
at july   these assets had a book value of  net of accumulated depreciation  and are included in property and equipment in our consolidated balance sheet 
such assets will be held and used during the relocation of the manufacturing operations until december  based on an appraisal obtained in june  a gain of approximately  may be generated when the building and land are sold 
however  due to the deteriorating real estate market and other factors  no assurances can be given as to the timing of the sale and whether a gain or loss on the sale of the facility will ultimately be realized 
discontinued operations termination of carsen s operations on july   carsen closed the sale of substantially all of its assets to olympus under an asset purchase agreement dated as of may  among carsen  cantel and olympus 
olympus purchased substantially all of carsen s assets other than those related to carsen s medivators business and certain other smaller product lines 
following the closing  olympus hired substantially all of carsen s employees and took over carsen s olympus related operations as well as the operations related to the other acquired product lines 
the transaction resulted in an after tax gain of  and was recorded separately on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended july  as gain on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax 
in connection with the transaction  carsen s medivators related assets as well as certain of its other assets that were not acquired by olympus were sold to our new canadian distributor of medivators products 
the purchase price for the net assets sold to olympus was approximately  comprised of a fixed sum of  plus an additional formula based sum of  in addition  olympus paid carsen of olympus revenues attributable to carsen s unfilled customer orders backlog as of july  that were assumed by olympus at the closing 
such payments to carsen were made following olympus receipt of customer payments for such orders and totaled  in fiscal  the entire  related to such backlog was recorded as income and reported in income from discontinued operations  net of tax  in the consolidated statements of income 
the  fixed portion of the purchase price was in consideration for i carsen s customer lists  sales records  and certain other assets related to the sale and servicing of olympus products and certain non olympus products distributed by carsen  ii the release of olympus contractual restriction on hiring carsen personnel  iii real property leases which were assumed or replaced by olympus and leasehold improvements  computer and software systems  equipment and machinery  telephone systems  and records related to the acquired assets  and iv assisting olympus in effecting a smooth transition of carsen s business of distributing and servicing olympus and certain non olympus products in canada 
cantel has also agreed on behalf of itself and its affiliates not to manufacture  distribute  sell or represent for sale in canada through july  any products that are competitive with the olympus products formerly sold by carsen under its olympus distribution agreements 
the  formula based portion of the purchase price was based on the book value of carsen s inventories of olympus and certain non olympus products and the net book amount of carsen s accounts receivable and certain other assets  all at july   subject to offsets  particularly for accounts payable of carsen due to olympus 
net proceeds from carsen s sale of net assets and the termination of carsen s operations were approximately  excluding the backlog payments after satisfaction of remaining liabilities and taxes 
as a result of the foregoing transaction  which coincided with the expiration of carsen s exclusive distribution agreements with olympus on july   carsen no longer has any remaining product lines or active business operations 
cash flows attributable to discontinued operations comprise the following year ended july  net cash used in provided by operating activities net cash provided by investing activities 
table of contents in fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was due to the payment of carsen s remaining liabilities that existed at july   which primarily related to various taxes 
in fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the payment of carsen s remaining operating costs relating to fiscal  income tax payments and various wind down costs  partially offset by the collection of the remaining receivables 
in fiscal  net cash provided by investing activities was due to proceeds from disposal of the discontinued operations 
financing activities of our discontinued operations did not result in any net cash in fiscals  and direct sale of medivators systems in the united states on august   we commenced the sale and service of our medivators brand endoscope reprocessing equipment  high level disinfectants  cleaners and consumables through our own united states field sales and service organization 
our direct sale of these products is the result of our decision that it is in our best long term interests to control and develop our own direct hospital based united states distribution network and  as such  not to renew olympus exclusive united states distribution agreement when it expired on august  throughout the former distribution arrangement with olympus  we employed our own personnel to provide clinical sales support activities as well as an internal technical and customer service function  depot maintenance and service and all logistics and distribution services for the medivators olympus customer base 
this existing and fully developed infrastructure will continue to be a critical factor in our new direct sales and service strategy 
notwithstanding the expiration of the distribution agreement with olympus on august   olympus has retained the right to purchase from minntech for resale to certain permitted customers  medivators accessories  consumables  and replacement and repair parts  as well as rapicide disinfectant 
various aspects of such rights expire over the next three years 
during fiscals and  olympus continued to purchase such items from us  although we have been gradually converting the sale of such items over to our direct sales and service force 
long term contractual obligations as of july   aggregate annual required payments over the next five years and thereafter under our contractual obligations that have long term components are as follows year ended july  amounts in thousands thereafter total maturities of the credit facilities expected interest payments under the credit facilities minimum commitments under noncancelable operating leases minimum commitments under noncancelable capital leases minimum commitments under license agreement deferred compensation and other employment agreements total contractual obligations the expected interest payments under the term and revolving credit facilities reflect interest rates of and  respectively  which were our interest rates on outstanding borrowings at july  credit facilities in conjunction with the acquisition of crosstex  we entered into amended and restated credit facilities dated as of august  the us credit facilities with a consortium of lenders to fund the cash consideration paid in the 
table of contents acquisition and costs associated with the acquisition  as well as to modify our existing united states credit facilities 
the us credit facilities  as amended  include i a six year million senior secured amortizing term loan facility and ii a five year million senior secured revolving credit facility 
amounts we repay under the term loan facility may not be re borrowed 
debt issuance costs relating to the us credit facilities have been recorded in other assets and are being amortized over the life of the credit facilities 
such unamortized debt issuance costs amounted to approximately  at july  at september   borrowings under the us credit facilities bear interest at rates ranging from to above the lender s base rate  or at rates ranging from to above the london interbank offered rate libor  depending upon our consolidated ratio of debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and as further adjusted under the terms of the us credit facilities ebitda 
at september   the lender s base rate was and the libor rates on our outstanding borrowings ranged from to 
the margins applicable to our outstanding borrowings at september  were above the lender s base rate and above libor 
substantially all of our outstanding borrowings were under libor contracts at september  the majority of such contracts were twelve month libor contracts  therefore  we are substantially protected throughout most of fiscal from any exposure associated with increasing libor rates 
in order to protect our interest rate exposure in future years  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement in july for the two year period beginning june  and ending june  initially covering  of borrowings under the term loan facility and thereafter reducing in quarterly  increments consistent with the mandatory repayment schedule of our term loan facility  which caps three month libor on this portion of outstanding borrowings at 
the us credit facilities also provide for fees on the unused portion of our facilities at rates ranging from to  depending upon our consolidated ratio of debt to ebitda  such rate was at september  the us credit facilities require us to meet certain financial covenants and are secured by i substantially all of our us based assets including assets of cantel  minntech  mar cor  crosstex and strong dental and ii our pledge of all of the outstanding shares of minntech  mar cor  crosstex and strong dental and of the outstanding shares of our foreign based subsidiaries 
additionally  we are not permitted to pay cash dividends on our common stock without the consent of our united states lenders 
as of july   we are in compliance with all financial and other covenants under the us credit facilities 
on july  and september   we had  of outstanding borrowings under the us credit facilities  which consisted of  and  under the term loan facility and the revolving credit facility  respectively 
operating leases minimum commitments under operating leases include minimum rental commitments for our leased manufacturing facilities  warehouses  office space and equipment 
rent expense related to operating leases for fiscal was recorded on a straight line basis and aggregated  compared with  and  for fiscal and  respectively  which excludes rent expense in fiscal related to our discontinued operations 
license agreement on january   we entered into a license agreement with a third party which allows us to manufacture  use  import  sell and distribute certain thermal control products relating to our specialty packaging segment 
in consideration  we agreed to pay a minimum annual royalty payable in canadian dollars each calendar year over the license agreement term of years 
at july   we had minimum future royalty obligations of approximately  relating to this license agreement 
deferred compensation included in other long term liabilities are deferred compensation arrangements for certain former minntech directors and officers 
employment agreements we have previously entered into various employment agreements with several executives of the company  including the former president and chief executive officer 
effective april   our former president and chief executive officer 
table of contents resigned and our chief operating officer and executive vice president was promoted to president 
as a result of this resignation  estimated separation benefits and other related costs of approximately  were recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income during fiscal approximately  of such amount is not payable until after november   and accordingly  has been reflected in the table above as a required payment during fiscal financing needs at july   we had a cash balance of  of which  was held by foreign subsidiaries 
we believe that our current cash position  anticipated cash flows from operations  and the funds available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our cash operating requirements for the foreseeable future based upon our existing operations 
at september    was available under our united states revolving credit facility  as amended 
foreign currency during fiscal  compared with fiscal  the average value of the canadian dollar increased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar 
the financial statements of our canadian subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements and therefore are impacted by changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate 
additionally  changes in the value of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar favorably affected our results of operations because a portion of our canadian subsidiaries inventories and operating costs which are reported in the water purification and filtration and specialty packaging segments are purchased in the united states and a significant amount of their sales are to customers in the united states 
overall  fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states and canada had an adverse impact in fiscal  compared with fiscal  upon our continuing results of operations of approximately  net of tax 
during fiscal  compared with fiscal  the value of the euro increased by approximately relative to the value of the united states dollar and by approximately relative to the value of the british pound 
the financial statements of our netherlands subsidiary are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements and therefore are impacted by changes in the euro exchange rate relative to the united states dollar 
additionally  changes in the value of the euro against the united states dollar and british pound affect our results of operations because a portion of the net assets of our netherlands subsidiary which are reported in our dialysis  endoscope reprocessing and water purification and filtration segments are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars or british pounds but must be converted into its functional euro currency 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to the united states dollar and british pound on the conversion of such dollar denominated net assets into functional currency  we enter into short term contracts to purchase euros forward  which contracts are generally one month in duration 
these short term contracts are designated as fair value hedges 
there were two foreign currency forward contracts amounting to  and  at september  which cover certain assets and liabilities of minntech s netherlands subsidiary which are denominated in united states dollars and british pounds  respectively 
such contracts expired on september  under our credit facilities  such contracts to purchase euros may not exceed  in an aggregate notional amount at any time 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  such foreign currency forward contracts are designated as hedges 
gains and losses related to these hedging contracts to buy euros forward are immediately realized within general and administrative expenses due to the short term nature of such contracts 
in fiscal  such forward contracts were partially effective in offsetting the impact of the strengthening of the euro on certain assets and liabilities of minntech s netherlands subsidiary that are denominated in united states dollars or british pounds 
overall  fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the euro and the united states dollar and british pound had an adverse impact in fiscal  compared with fiscal  upon our continuing results of operations of approximately  net of tax 
for purposes of translating the balance sheet at july  compared with july   the value of the canadian dollar increased by approximately and the value of the euro increased by approximately compared with the value of the united states dollar 
the total of these currency movements resulted in a foreign currency translation gain of  in fiscal  thereby increasing stockholders equity 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar during fiscal  compared with fiscal  did not have a significant impact upon either our results of operations or the translation of our balance sheet  primarily 
table of contents due to the fact that our japanese subsidiary accounts for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  net income and net assets 
inflation during fiscal  we experienced unprecedented price increases in certain raw materials due in large part to the rising price of fuel and oil  including chemicals  paper pulp  and plastics resins and bottles  which had a significant adverse impact on our gross margins 
rising fuel and oil prices also had a significant adverse impact on transportation costs related to both the purchasing and delivery of products  which also impacted our gross margins 
we implemented price increases for certain of our products  which partially offset these cost increases  however  some of our businesses primarily the water purification and filtration and healthcare disposables segments were unable to obtain higher selling prices necessary to offset the full impact of such higher costs  which resulted in the loss of gross margin  as more fully described in results of operations 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we continually evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue on product sales is recognized as products are shipped to customers and title passes 
the passing of title is determined based upon the fob terms specified for each shipment 
with respect to dialysis  therapeutic  specialty packaging and endoscope reprocessing products  shipment terms are generally fob origin for common carrier and fob destination when our distribution fleet is utilized except for one large customer in dialysis whereby all products are shipped fob destination 
with respect to water purification and filtration and healthcare disposable products  shipment terms may be either fob origin or destination 
customer acceptance for the majority of our product sales occurs at the time of delivery 
in certain instances  primarily with respect to some of our water purification and filtration equipment  endoscope reprocessing equipment and an insignificant amount of our sales of dialysis equipment  post delivery obligations such as installation  in servicing or training are contractually specified  in such instances  revenue recognition is deferred until all of such conditions have been substantially fulfilled such that the products are deemed functional by the end user 
with respect to a portion of water purification and filtration product sales  equipment is sold as part of a system for which the equipment is functionally interdependent or the customer s purchase order specifies ship complete as a condition of delivery  revenue recognition on such sales is deferred until all equipment has been delivered 
a portion of our water purification and filtration sales relating to our acquisition of ge water are recognized as multiple element arrangements  whereby revenue is allocated to the equipment and installation components based upon vendor specific objective evidence which principally includes comparable historical transactions of similar equipment and installation sold as stand alone components  as well as an evaluation of unrelated third party competitor pricing of similar installation 
revenue on service sales is recognized when repairs are completed at the customer s location or when repairs are completed at our facilities and the products are shipped to customers 
with respect to certain service contracts in our endoscope reprocessing and water purification and filtration operating segments  service revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the contractual term of the arrangement 
all shipping and handling fees invoiced to customers  such as freight  are recorded as revenue and related costs are included within cost of sales at the time the sale is recognized 
none of our sales contain right of return provisions except certain sales of a small portion of our endoscope reprocessing equipment which contain a day right of return trial period 
such sales are not recognized as revenue until the day trial period has elapsed 
customer claims for credit or return due to damage  defect  shortage or other reason must be 
table of contents pre approved by us before credit is issued or such product is accepted for return 
no cash discounts for early payment are offered except with respect to a portion of our sales of dialysis and healthcare disposable products and certain prepaid packaging products 
we do not offer price protection  although advance pricing contracts or required notice periods prior to implementation of price increases exist for certain customers with respect to many of our products 
with respect to certain of our dialysis  dental and water purification and filtration customers  volume rebates are provided  such volume rebates are provided for as a reduction of sales at the time of revenue recognition and amounted to   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
such allowances are determined based on estimated projections of sales volume for the entire rebate agreement periods 
if it becomes known that sales volume to customers will deviate from original projections  the volume rebate provisions originally established would be adjusted accordingly 
the majority of our dialysis products are sold to end users  the majority of therapeutic filtration products and healthcare disposable products are sold to third party distributors  water purification and filtration products and services are sold directly and through third party distributors to hospitals  dialysis clinics  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and other end users  our endoscope reprocessing products and services are sold primarily to distributors internationally and directly to hospitals and other end users in the united states  and specialty packaging products are sold to third party distributors  medical research companies  laboratories  pharmaceutical companies  hospitals  government agencies and other end users 
sales to all of these customers follow our revenue recognition policies 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities 
allowances for doubtful accounts are reserves for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we use historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate 
while actual losses have historically been within management s expectations and provisions established  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
alternatively  if certain customers paid their delinquent receivables  reductions in allowances may be required 
inventories inventories consist of products which are sold in the ordinary course of our business and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
in assessing the value of inventories  we must make estimates and judgments regarding reserves required for product obsolescence  aging of inventories and other issues potentially affecting the saleable condition of products 
in performing such evaluations  we use historical experience as well as current market information 
with few exceptions  the saleable value of our inventories has historically been within management s expectation and provisions established  however  rapid changes in the market due to competition  technology and various other factors could have an adverse effect on the saleable value of our inventories  resulting in the need for additional reserves 
goodwill and intangible assets certain of our identifiable intangible assets  including customer relationships  technology  brand names  non compete agreements and patents  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives which range from to years 
additionally  we have recorded goodwill and trademarks and trade names  all of which have indefinite useful lives and are therefore not amortized 
all of our intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable  and goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for impairment at least annually 
our management is primarily responsible for determining if impairment exists and considers a number of factors  including third party valuations  when making these determinations 
in performing a review for goodwill impairment  management uses a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the related operating segments by using the average fair value results of the market multiple and discounted cash flow methodologies 
the first step is a review for potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of impairment  if any 
in performing our annual review for indefinite lived intangibles  management compares the current fair value of such assets to their carrying values 
with respect to amortizable intangible assets when impairment indicators are present  management would determine whether non discounted cash flows would be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  if not  the carrying value of the assets would be adjusted to their fair value 
on july   management concluded that none of our intangible assets or goodwill was impaired 
while the results of these annual reviews have historically not indicated impairment  impairment reviews are highly dependent on management s projections of our future operating results and cash flows which management believes to be reasonable  discount rates based on the company s weighted average cost of capital and appropriate benchmark peer 
table of contents companies 
assumptions used in determining future operating results and cash flows include current and expected market conditions and future sales forecasts 
subsequent changes in these assumptions and estimates could result in future impairment 
although we consistently use the same methods in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations  such estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results 
at july   our reporting units that are potentially at risk for impairment are healthcare disposables and specialty packaging  which had average fair values that exceeded book value by modest amounts 
for all of our remaining reporting units  average fair value exceeded book value by substantial amounts 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets including property  equipment and other assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an assessment is made to determine if the sum of the expected future non discounted cash flows from the use of the assets and eventual disposition is less than the carrying value 
if the sum of the expected non discounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized based on fair value 
with few exceptions  our historical assessments of our long lived assets have not differed significantly from the actual amounts realized 
however  the determination of fair value requires us to make certain assumptions and estimates and is highly subjective  and accordingly  actual amounts realized may differ significantly from our estimates 
warranties we provide for estimated costs that may be incurred to remedy deficiencies of quality or performance of our products at the time of revenue recognition 
most of our products have a one year warranty  although a majority of our endoscope reprocessing equipment in the united states carry a warranty period of up to fifteen months 
we record provisions for product warranties as a component of cost of sales based upon an estimate of the amounts necessary to settle existing and future claims on products sold 
the historical relationship of warranty costs to products sold is the primary basis for the estimate 
a significant increase in third party service repair rates  the cost and availability of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
management reviews its warranty exposure periodically and believes that the warranty reserves are adequate  however  actual claims incurred could differ from original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
stock based compensation on august   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment revised sfas r using the modified prospective method for the transition 
under the modified prospective method  stock compensation expense is recognized for any option grant or stock award granted on or after august   as well as the unvested portion of stock options granted prior to august   based upon the award s fair value 
for fiscal and earlier periods  we accounted for stock options using the intrinsic value method under which stock compensation expense is not recognized because we granted stock options with exercise prices equal to the market value of the shares at the date of grant 
most of our stock option and stock awards which consist only of restricted stock are subject to graded vesting in which portions of the award vest at different times during the vesting period  as opposed to awards that vest at the end of the vesting period 
we recognize compensation expense for awards subject to graded vesting using the straight line basis  reduced by estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
the stock based compensation expense recorded in our consolidated financial statements may not be representative of the effect of stock based compensation expense in future periods due to the level of awards issued in past years which level may not be similar in the future  assumptions used in determining fair value  and estimated forfeitures 
we determine the fair value of each stock award using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the determination of fair value using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the expected option life which is determined by using the historical closing prices of our common stock  the expected dividend yield which is expected to be  and the expected option life which is based on historical exercise behavior 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we would record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
with respect to stock options granted subsequent to october   we reassessed both the expected option 
table of contents life and stock price volatility assumptions by evaluating more recent historical exercise behavior and stock price activity  such reevaluation resulted in reductions in both the volatility  and for certain options  the expected option lives 
legal proceedings in the normal course of business  we are subject to pending and threatened legal actions 
we record legal fees and other expenses related to litigation as incurred 
additionally  we assess  in consultation with our counsel  the need to record a liability for litigation and contingencies on a case by case basis 
amounts are accrued when we  in consultation with counsel  determine that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount of anticipated exposure can be reasonably estimated 
income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities also include items recorded in conjunction with the purchase accounting for business acquisitions 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance  if necessary  based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the recorded deferred tax assets  as adjusted for valuation allowances  will be realized 
additionally  deferred tax liabilities are regularly reviewed to confirm that such amounts are appropriately stated 
such a review considers known future changes in various effective tax rates  principally in the united states 
if the effective tax rate were to change in the future  particularly in the united states and to a lesser extent canada  our items of deferred tax could be materially affected 
all of such evaluations require significant management judgments 
in fiscal  recently enacted canadian federal and new york state statutory tax rate reductions were applied to existing deferred income tax liabilities decreasing our overall effective tax rate 
we record liabilities for an unrecognized tax benefit when a tax benefit for an uncertain tax position is taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  but is not recognized in our consolidated financial statements because it does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold that the uncertain tax position would be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority 
the majority of such unrecognized tax benefits originated from acquisitions and are based primarily upon management s assessment of exposure associated with acquired companies 
accordingly  any adjustments upon resolution of income tax uncertainties that predate or result from acquisitions are recorded as an increase or decrease to goodwill 
unrecognized tax benefits are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made  as events occur to warrant adjustment to the related liability 
business combinations acquisitions require significant estimates and judgments related to the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
certain liabilities and reserves are subjective in nature 
we reflect such liabilities and reserves based upon the most recent information available 
in conjunction with our acquisitions  such subjective liabilities and reserves principally include certain income tax and sales and use tax exposures  including tax liabilities related to our foreign subsidiaries  as well as reserves for accounts receivable  inventories and warranties 
the ultimate settlement of such liabilities may be for amounts which are different from the amounts recorded 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities we recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities  such as costs to terminate a contract  the exit or disposal of a business  or the early termination of a leased property  by recognizing the liability at fair value when incurred  except for certain one time termination benefits  such as severance costs  for which the period of recognition begins when a severance plan is communicated to employees 
inherent in the calculation of liabilities relating to exit and disposal activities are significant management judgments and estimates  including estimates of termination costs  employee attrition  and the interest rate used to discount certain expected net cash payments 
such judgments and estimates are reviewed by us on a regular basis 
the cumulative effect of a change to a liability resulting from a revision to either timing or the amount of estimated cash flows is recognized by us as an adjustment to the liability in the period of the change 

table of contents although we have historically recorded minimal charges associated with exit or disposal activities  we recorded approximately  in severance and inventory charges in fiscal  and expect additional charges of approximately  in fiscal  relating to our restructuring plan for our netherlands manufacturing operations 
we also recorded  of severance costs in income from discontinued operations in fiscal related to the sale of substantially all of carsen s assets 
other matters we do not have any off balance sheet financial arrangements  other than future commitments under operating leases and employment and license agreements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency and market risk a portion of our products are imported from the far east and western europe 
all of our operating segments sell a portion of their products outside of the united states and our netherlands subsidiary sells a portion of its products outside of the european union 
consequently  our business could be materially affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rates of exchange of various currencies  tariff increases and import and export restrictions  affecting the united states  canada and the netherlands 
a portion of our canadian subsidiaries inventories and operating costs which are reported in the water purification and filtration and specialty packaging segments are purchased in the united states and a significant amount of their sales are to customers in the united states 
the businesses of our canadian subsidiaries could be materially and adversely affected by the imposition of trade barriers  fluctuations in the rate of currency exchange  tariff increases and import and export restrictions between the united states and canada 
additionally  the financial statements of our canadian subsidiaries are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the united states and canada had an overall adverse impact in fiscal  compared with fiscal  upon our continuing results of operations and a positive impact on stockholders equity  as described in our md a 
changes in the value of the euro against the united states dollar and british pound affect our results of operations because a portion of the net assets of our netherlands subsidiary which are reported in our dialysis  endoscope reprocessing and water purification and filtration segments are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars or british pounds but must be converted into its functional euro currency 
additionally  the financial statements of our netherlands subsidiary are translated using the accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fluctuations in the rates of currency exchange between the euro and the united states dollar and british pound had an overall adverse impact in fiscal  compared with fiscal  upon our continuing results of operations  and had a positive impact upon stockholders equity  as described in our md a 
in order to hedge against the impact of fluctuations in the value of the euro relative to the united states dollar and british pound on the conversion of such dollar and pound denominated net assets into functional currency  we enter into short term contracts to purchase euros forward  which contracts are generally one month in duration 
these short term contracts are designated as fair value hedges 
there were two foreign currency forward contracts amounting to  and  at july  which covered certain assets and liabilities of minntech s netherlands subsidiary which are denominated in united states dollars and british pounds  respectively 
such contracts expired on august  these foreign currency forward contracts are continually replaced with new one month contracts as long as we have significant net assets at our netherlands subsidiary that are denominated and ultimately settled in united states dollars or british pounds 
under our credit facilities  such contracts to purchase euros may not exceed  in an aggregate notional amount at any time 
in fiscal  such forward contracts were effective in offsetting a portion of the impact on operations of the strengthening of the euro 
the functional currency of minntech s japan subsidiary is the japanese yen 
changes in the value of the japanese yen relative to the united states dollar during fiscal  compared with  did not have a significant impact upon either our results of operations or the translation of the balance sheet  primarily due to the fact that our japanese subsidiary accounts for a relatively small portion of consolidated net sales  net income and net assets 

table of contents interest rate market risk we have a united states credit facility for which the interest rate on outstanding borrowings is variable 
substantially all of our outstanding borrowings are under libor contracts 
therefore  interest expense is affected by the general level of interest rates in the united states as well as libor interest rates 
market risk sensitive transactions we are exposed to market risks arising principally from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency 
with respect to interest rate risk  our outstanding debt is under our united states credit facilities  described elsewhere in liquidity and capital resources 
such credit facilities consist of outstanding debt with fixed repayment amounts at prevailing market rates of interest  principally under libor contracts ranging from one to twelve months 
therefore  our market risk with respect to such debt is the increase in interest expense which would result from higher interest rates associated with libor 
such outstanding debt under our united states credit facilities was  and  at july  and  respectively  and the average outstanding balance during fiscal and was approximately  and  respectively 
during fiscal and  the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt was and  respectively 
a basis point increase in average libor interest rates would have resulted in incremental interest expense of approximately  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
however  the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt at july  has decreased to due to decreases in libor rates as well as the margin applicable to our outstanding borrowings 
substantially all of our outstanding borrowings were under libor contracts at september  the majority of such contracts were twelve month libor contracts entered into prior to recent market volatility in libor rates  therefore  we are substantially protected throughout most of fiscal from any exposure associated with increasing libor rates 
in order to protect our interest rate exposure in future years  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement in july for the two year period beginning june  and ending june  initially covering  of borrowings under the term loan facility and thereafter reducing in quarterly  increments consistent with the mandatory repayment schedule of our term loan facility  which caps three month libor on this portion of outstanding borrowings at 
therefore  using the july  margin applicable to our outstanding borrowings of above libor  our interest rate on borrowings under the term loan facility would be capped at for the two year period ending june  our other long term liabilities would not be materially affected by an increase in interest rates 
we also maintained a cash balance of  at july  which is either maintained in cash or invested in low risk and low return cash equivalents such as short term guaranteed investment certificates issued by various canadian banks and united states money market funds with leading banking institutions 
an increase in interest rates would generate additional interest income for us from these low risk cash equivalents  which would partially offset the adverse impact of the additional interest expense 
with respect to foreign currency exchange rates  we are principally impacted by changes in the canadian dollar and the euro as these currencies relate to the united states dollar and changes in the british pound as this currency relates to the euro 
we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency transactions 
market risk is defined here as the potential change in fair value resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
our canadian subsidiaries and netherlands subsidiary have net assets in currencies principally united states dollars and british pounds other than their functional canadian and euro currency which must be converted into its functional currency  thereby giving rise to realized foreign exchange gains and losses 
therefore  our canadian subsidiaries and netherlands subsidiary are exposed to risk if the value of the canadian dollar or euro appreciates relative to the united states dollar and if the euro appreciates relative to the british pound 
for fiscals and  a uniform increase in the canadian dollar and euro relative to the united states dollar  and the euro relative to the british pound  would have resulted in aggregate realized losses after tax of approximately  and  respectively 
however  since our netherlands subsidiary uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge against the impact of fluctuations of the euro relative to the united states dollar and the british pound on certain united states and british denominated assets and liabilities  realized losses relating to the fluctuation of the euro would be partially offset by gains on the foreign currency forward contracts 
in addition to the above  adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact the translation of our financial statements 
for fiscals and  a uniform adverse movement in foreign currency rates would have resulted in 
table of contents realized losses after tax of approximately  and  respectively  due to the translation of the results of operations of foreign subsidiaries adverse changes would be caused by appreciation of either the canadian dollar or the euro relative to the united states dollar 
however  such a change in foreign currency rates would have resulted in an unrealized gain on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries of  and  in fiscals and  respectively 
such an unrealized gain would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in our stockholders equity 
conversely  if the canadian dollar and the euro depreciated by relative to the united states dollar  we would have recognized realized gains after tax of approximately  and  in fiscals and  respectively  and unrealized losses of  and  in fiscals and  respectively  on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
however  since we view these investments as long term  we would not expect such unrealized losses to be realized in the near term 
the aggregate adverse or favorable impact  net of tax  to our results of operations of a uniform increase in foreign currency exchange rates  as described above  due to both financial statement translation and functional currency conversion would have been  and  for fiscals and  respectively  partially offset by the affect of our foreign currency forward contracts
