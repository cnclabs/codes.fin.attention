table of contents rjr tobacco rjr tobacco primarily conducts business in the highly competitive us cigarette market  which has a few large manufacturers and many smaller participants 
the us cigarette market is a mature market in which overall consumer demand has declined since and is expected to continue to decline 
trade inventory adjustments may result in short term changes in demand for rjr tobacco s products when wholesale and retail tobacco distributors adjust the timing of their purchases of product to manage their inventory levels 
rjr tobacco believes it is not appropriate for it to speculate on other external factors that may impact the purchasing decisions of the wholesale and retail tobacco distributors 
at the beginning of  rjr tobacco refined its brand portfolio strategy and modified its then existing brand categories to growth  support and non support categories 
the growth brands consist of two premium brands  camel and kool  and a value brand  pall mall 
although all of these brands are managed for long term market share and profit growth  camel and kool will continue to receive the most significant levels of investment support 
the support brands include three premium brands  winston  salem and capri  and two value brands  doral and misty  all of which receive limited marketing support 
the remaining non support brands are managed to maximize near term profitability 
rjr tobacco expects this focused portfolio strategy will result in growth in total rjr tobacco share  as gains on growth brands more than offset declines among other brands 
competition is based primarily on brand positioning  including price  product attributes and packaging  consumer loyalty  promotions  advertising and retail presence 
cigarette brands produced by the major manufacturers generally require competitive pricing  substantial marketing support  retail programs and other incentives to maintain or improve market position or to introduce a new brand style 
most recently  competition among the major manufacturers has broadened to include a new smokeless  spitless category  known as snus 
snus is pasteurized tobacco that is currently sold in a small pouch that provides discreet and convenient tobacco consumption 
other cigarette manufacturers and smokeless tobacco manufacturers also are testing products in this new category 
rjr tobacco is expanding snus into additional markets in the first half of rjr tobacco is committed to building and maintaining a portfolio of profitable brands

in addition to building strong brand equity  rjr tobacco s marketing approach utilizes a retail pricing strategy  including discounting at retail  to defend certain brands shares of market against competitive pricing pressure 
rjr tobacco s competitive pricing methods include list price changes  discounting programs  such as retail buydowns  free product promotions and consumer coupons 
retail buydowns refer to payments made to the retailer to reduce the price that consumers pay at retail 
consumer coupons are distributed by a variety of methods  including in  or on  the cigarette pack and by direct mail 
free product promotions include offers such as buy packs  get pack free
