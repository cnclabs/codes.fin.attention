item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we are a provider of primary care physician services 
through our network of medical centers  we provide primary care medical services on an outpatient basis 
we also provide practice management services to ipas at medical offices 
all of our medical centers and ipas are located in miami dade  broward and hillsborough counties  florida 
as of june   we provided services to or for approximately  patients on a risk basis and approximately  patients on a limited or non risk basis as of june  additionally  we also provided services to over  patients as of june  on a non risk fee for service basis 
in fiscal  approximately and of our revenue was generated by providing services to medicare eligible and medicaid eligible members  respectively  under risk agreements that require us to assume responsibility to provide and pay for all of our patients medical needs in exchange for a capitated fee  typically a percentage of the premium received by an hmo from various payor sources 
effective october   we completed the acquisition of the mdhc companies 
accordingly  the revenues  expenses and results of operations of the mdhc companies have been included in our consolidated statements of income from the date of acquisition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for unaudited pro forma financial information for fiscal and presenting our operating results as though the acquisition occurred at the beginning of the respective periods 
effective march   one of the physician provider agreements with wellcare was amended from a non risk arrangement to a risk arrangement under which we receive for our services a monthly capitated fee with respect to patients assigned to us that represents a percentage of the premium that wellcare receives for those patients 
under the risk arrangement we assume full financial responsibility for the provision of all necessary medical care to our patients 
under this physician provider agreement  as of june   we provided services to approximately  medicare advantage patients enrolled in wellcare managed care plans 
effective january   we entered into the risk ipa agreement with humana under which we agreed to assume certain management responsibilities on a risk basis for humana s medicare and medicaid members assigned to certain ipas practicing in miami dade and broward counties  florida 
under the risk ipa agreement  we receive a capitation fee established as a percentage of premium that humana receives for its members who have selected the ipas as their primary care physicians and assume responsibility for the cost of all medical services provided to these members  even those we do not provide directly 
medical service revenue and medical services expenses related to the risk ipa agreement approximated million and million in fiscal  respectively  million and million in fiscal  respectively  and million and million in fiscal  respectively 
as of june   the ipas provided services to or for approximately  medicare and medicaid patients enrolled in humana managed care plans 
the risk ipa agreement replaces the humana pgp agreement that was terminated effective december  under the humana pgp agreement  we assumed certain management responsibilities on a non risk basis for humana s medicare  medicaid and commercial members assigned to selected primary care physicians in miami dade and broward counties  florida 
revenue from this contract consisted of a monthly management fee intended to cover the costs of providing these services and amounted to approximately million during fiscal in an effort to streamline and stem operating losses  we implemented a plan to dispose of our home health operations in december the home health disposition occurred in three separate transactions and was concluded in february as a result of these transactions  the home health operations are shown as discontinued operations 
medicare and medicaid considerations substantially all of our revenue is generated by providing services to medicare eligible members and medicaid eligible members 
the federal government and state governments  including florida  from time to time explore ways to reduce medical care costs through medicare and medicaid reform  specifically  and through health care reform generally 
any changes that would limit  reduce or delay receipt of medicare or medicaid funding or mandate increased benefit levels or any developments that would disqualify us from receiving medicare or medicaid funding could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  prospects  financial results  financial condition and cash flows 
due to the diverse range of medical care related proposals put forth and the uncertainty of any proposal s adoption  we cannot predict what impact any medicare reform proposal ultimately adopted may have on our business  financial position or results of operations 
on january   the medicare prescription drug plan created by the medicare modernization act became effective 
as a result  our hmo affiliates have established or expanded prescription drug benefit plans for their medicare advantage members 
under the terms of our risk arrangements  we are financially responsible for a substantial portion of the cost of the prescription drugs our patients receive  and  in exchange  our hmo affiliates have agreed to provide us with an additional per member capitated fee related to prescription drug coverage 
however  there can be no assurance that the additional fee that we receive will be sufficient to reimburse us for the additional costs that we may incur under the new medicare prescription drug plan 

table of contents in addition  the premiums our hmo affiliates receive from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for their medicare prescription drug plans is subject to periodic adjustment  positive or negative  based upon the application of risk corridors that compare their plans revenues targeted in their bids to actual prescription drug costs 
variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to the hmos or require the hmos to refund to cms a portion of the payments they received 
our contracted hmo affiliates estimate and periodically adjust premium revenues related to the risk corridor payment adjustment  and a portion of the hmo s estimated premium revenue adjustment is allocated to us 
as a result  the revenues recognized under our risk arrangements with our hmo affiliates are net of the portion of the estimated risk corridor adjustment allocated to us 
the portion of any such risk corridor adjustment that the hmos allocate to us may not directly correlate to the historical utilization patterns of our patients or the costs that we may incur in future periods 
our hmo affiliates allocated to us adjustments related to their risk corridor payments which had the effect of reducing our operating income by approximately million  million and million  respectively  during fiscal  and  respectively 
the medicare prescription drug plan has also been subject to significant public criticism and controversy  and members of congress have discussed possible changes to the program as well as ways to reduce the program s cost to the federal government 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  these developments may have on the medicare prescription drug plan or on our future financial results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements and accompanying notes requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain of the amounts recorded on our financial statements could change materially under different  yet still reasonable  estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience  knowledge of current events and expectations of future events  and we continuously evaluate and update our estimates and assumptions 
however  our estimates and assumptions may ultimately prove to be incorrect or incomplete and  as a result  our actual results may differ materially from those previously reported 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition under our risk contracts with hmos  we receive a percentage of premium or other capitated fee for each patient that chooses one of our physicians as their primary care physician 
revenue under these agreements is generally recorded in the period we assume responsibility to provide services at the rates then in effect as determined by the respective contract 
as part of the medicare advantage program  cms periodically recomputes the premiums to be paid to the hmos based on updated health status of participants and updated demographic factors 
we record any adjustments to this revenue at the time that the information necessary to make the determination of the adjustment is received from the hmo 
under our risk agreements  we assume responsibility for the cost of all medical services provided to the patient  even those we do not provide directly  in exchange for a percentage of premium or other capitated fee 
to the extent that patients require more frequent or expensive care  our revenue under a contract may be insufficient to cover the costs of care provided 
when it is probable that expected future health care costs and maintenance costs under a contract or group of existing contracts will exceed anticipated capitated revenue on those contracts  we recognize losses on our prepaid health care services with hmos 
no contracts were considered loss contracts at june  because we have the right to terminate unprofitable physicians and close unprofitable centers under our managed care contracts 
under our limited risk and non risk contracts with hmos  we receive a capitation fee or management fee based on the number of patients for which we are providing services on a monthly basis 
the capitation fee or management fee is recorded as revenue in the period in which services are provided as determined by the respective contract 
payments under both our risk contracts and our non risk contracts for both the medicare advantage program as well as medicaid are also subject to reconciliation based upon historical patient enrollment data 
we record any adjustments to this revenue at the time that the information necessary to make the determination of the adjustment is received from the hmo or the applicable governmental body 

table of contents medical claims expense recognition the cost of health care services provided or contracted for is accrued in the period in which the services are provided 
this cost includes our estimate of the related liability for medical claims incurred in the period but not yet reported  or ibnr 
ibnr represents a material portion of our medical claims liability which is presented in the balance sheet netted against amounts due from hmos 
changes in this estimate can materially affect  either favorably or unfavorably  our results from operations and overall financial position 
we develop our estimate of ibnr primarily based on historical claims incurred per member per month 
we adjust our estimate if we have unusually high or low inpatient utilization or if benefit changes provided under the hmo plans are expected to significantly increase or reduce our claims exposure 
we also adjust our estimate for differences between the estimated claims expense recorded in prior months to actual claims expense as claims are paid by the hmo and reported to us 
we use an actuarial analysis as an additional tool to further corroborate our estimate of ibnr 
based on our analysis as of june   we recorded a liability of approximately million for ibnr which was relatively unchanged from the liability of million recorded as of june  the increase in the liability for ibnr of million or to million as of june  from million as of june  was primarily due to the additional liability recorded for ibnr related to the operations of the mdhc companies 
consideration of impairment related to goodwill and other intangible assets our balance sheet includes intangible assets  including goodwill and other separately identifiable intangible assets  of approximately million  which represented approximately of our total assets at june  the most significant component of the intangible assets consists of the intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition 
the purchase price  including acquisition costs  of approximately million was allocated to the estimated fair value of acquired tangible assets of million  identifiable intangible assets of million and assumed liabilities of million  resulting in goodwill totaling million 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if certain indicators of impairment arise 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized over their respective useful lives to their estimated residual values and also reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators of impairment arise 
indicators of impairment include  among other things  a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate  the loss of a key hmo contract  an adverse action by a regulator  unanticipated competition  and the loss of key personnel or allocation of goodwill to a portion of business that is to be sold 
because we operate in a single segment of business  we have determined that we have a single reporting unit and we perform our impairment test for goodwill on an enterprise level 
in performing the impairment test  we compare the total current market value of all of our outstanding common stock  to the current carrying value of our total net assets  including goodwill and intangible assets 
depending on the market value of our common stock at the time that an impairment test is required  there is a risk that a portion of our intangible assets would be considered impaired and must be written off during that period 
we completed our annual impairment test as of may   and determined that no impairment existed 
in addition  no indicators of impairment were noted and accordingly  no impairment charges were required at june  should we later determine that an indicator of impairment exists  we would be required to perform an additional impairment test 
realization of deferred income tax assets we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas which requires that deferred income tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we estimate our income taxes based on our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred income tax assets the future tax benefits from net operating loss carryforwards 
we evaluate the realizability of these deferred income tax assets by assessing their valuation allowances and by adjusting the amount of such allowances  if necessary 
among the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our projections of future taxable income streams  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences  and the impact of tax planning strategies that could be implemented to avoid the potential loss of future tax benefits 
however  changes in tax codes  statutory tax rates or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax accruals and assets and could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
at june   we had deferred income tax liabilities in excess of deferred income tax assets of approximately million 

table of contents share based payment we use the modified prospective transition method under sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires us to recognize compensation costs in our financial statements related to our share based payment transactions with employees and directors 
sfas r requires us to calculate this cost based on the grant date fair value of the equity instrument 
consistent with our practices prior to adopting sfas r  we have elected to calculate the fair value of our employee stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
using this model we calculated the fair value for employee stock options granted during fiscal and based on the following assumptions risk free interest rate ranging from to and to  respectively  dividend yield of  weighted average volatility factor of the expected market price of our common stock of and  respectively  and weighted average expected life of the options ranging from to years depending on the vesting provisions of each option 
the fair value for employee stock options granted during fiscal was calculated based on the following assumptions risk free interest rate ranging from to  dividend yield of  volatility factor of the expected market price of the company s common stock of  and weighted average expected life of the option ranging from to years depending on the vesting provisions of each option 
the expected life of the options is based on the historical exercise behavior of our employees 
the expected volatility factor is based on the historical volatility of the market price of our common stock as adjusted for certain events that management deemed to be non recurring and non indicative of future events 
as a result of adopting sfas r  we recognized share based compensation cost of million  million and million  respectively  for fiscal  and for fiscal and  the company did not recognize any excess tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options 
for the company recognized excess tax benefits of approximately million resulting from the exercise of stock options 
as of june   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested options  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
sfas r does not require the use of any particular option valuation model 
because our stock options have characteristics significantly different from traded options and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  it is possible that existing models may not necessarily provide a reliable measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
we selected the black scholes model based on our experience with it  its wide use by issuers comparable to us  and our review of alternate option valuation models 
the effect of applying the fair value method of accounting for stock options on reported net income for any period may not be representative of the effects for future periods because our outstanding options typically vest over a period of several years and additional awards may be made in future periods 

table of contents results of operations the following tables set forth  for the periods indicated  selected operating data as a percentage of total revenue 
year ended june  revenue operating expenses medical services medical claims other direct costs total medical services administrative payroll and employee benefits general and administrative gain on extinguishment of debt total operating expenses income from operations other income expense interest income interest expense income before income tax provision income tax provision net income comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june revenue revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal due primarily to increases in our medicare revenue 
the most significant component of our revenue is the revenue we generate from medicare patients under risk arrangements which increased by million  or  during fiscal during fiscal  revenue generated by our medicare risk arrangements increased approximately on a per patient per month basis and medicare patient months increased by approximately over fiscal the increase in the per member per month medicare revenue was primarily due to a rate increase in medicare premiums and an increase in premiums resulting from the medicare risk adjustment program 
the increase in medicare patient months was primarily due to the operations associated with the mdhc companies which we acquired effective october  and which were included in our results for only part of fiscal under the medicare risk adjustment program  the health status and demographic factors of medicare advantage participants are taken into account in determining premiums paid for each participant 
cms periodically recomputes the premiums to be paid to the hmos based on the updated health status and demographic factors of the medicare advantage participants 
in addition  the premiums paid to the hmos for their medicare prescription drug plan are subject to periodic adjustment based upon cms s risk corridor adjustment methodology 
the net effect of these premium adjustments included in revenue for the three month periods ended june  and were favorable retroactive medicare adjustments of million and million  respectively  and for fiscal and were unfavorable retroactive medicare adjustments of million and million  respectively 
future medicare risk adjustments may result in reductions of revenue depending on the future health status and demographic factors of our patients as well as the application of cms s risk corridor methodology to the hmos medicare prescription drug programs 
during fiscal and  we received payments and recorded amounts due from our hmo affiliates of approximately million and million  respectively  related primarily to medicare risk adjustments and pharmacy rebates relating to the operations of the mdhc companies for periods prior to completion of the acquisition 
while these transactions ordinarily are reflected in our results of operations  since they related to periods prior to our acquisition of the mdhc companies  they were instead recorded as purchase accounting adjustments which decreased the amount of goodwill we recorded for the acquisition 
revenue generated by our managed care entities under contracts with humana accounted for approximately and of our total revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue generated by our managed care entities under contracts with vista accounted for approximately and of our total revenue for fiscal and  respectively 

table of contents operating expenses medical services expenses are comprised of medical claims expense and other direct costs related to the provision of medical services to our patients 
because our risk contracts with hmos provide that we are financially responsible for the cost of substantially all medical services provided to our patients under those contracts  our medical claims expense includes the costs of prescription drugs these patients receive as well as medical services provided to patients under our risk contracts by providers other than us 
other direct costs consist primarily of salaries  taxes and benefits of our health professionals providing primary care services including a portion of our share based compensation cost  medical malpractice insurance costs  capitation payments to our ipa physicians and fees paid to independent contractors providing medical services to our patients 
medical services expenses for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal primarily due to the medical expenses related to the operations of the mdhc companies being included in our results for the entire fiscal period 
medical claims expense  which is the largest component of medical services expense  increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal primarily due to an increase in medicare claims expense of million  or 
the increase in medicare claims expense resulted from a increase in medical claims expense on a per patient per month basis and a increase in medicare patient months 
the increase in medicare per patient per month medical claims expense is primarily attributable to enhanced benefits offered by our hmo affiliates and inflationary trends in the health care industry  partially offset by a general improvement in medical claims expense management and utilization outcomes 
the increase in medicare patient months is primarily attributable to the operations associated with the mdhc companies which we acquired effective october  and which were included in our results for only part of fiscal as a percentage of revenue  medical services expenses decreased to for fiscal as compared to for fiscal our claims loss ratio medical claims expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to an increase in revenue at a greater rate than the increase in both our medical services expenses and our medical claims expense resulting primarily from a general improvement in medical claims expense management and utilization outcomes 
hmos  however  are under continuous competitive pressure to offer enhanced  and possibly more expensive benefits to their medicare advantage members 
the premiums cms pays to hmos for medicare advantage members are generally not increased as a result of those benefit enhancements 
this could increase our claims loss ratio in future periods  which could reduce our profitability and cash flows 
other direct costs increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of revenue  other direct costs remained unchanged at for fiscal and the increase in the amount of other direct costs was primarily due to the expenses related to the operations of the mdhc companies being included in our results for the entire fiscal period 
administrative payroll and employee benefits expenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of revenue  administrative payroll and employee benefits expenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in administrative payroll and employee benefits expenses was primarily due to an increase in incentive plan accruals related to our earnings during fiscal and an increase in personnel in connection with the acquisition of the mdhc companies which were reflected in our results for the entire fiscal period 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative expenses increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to expenses related to the operations of the mdhc companies and an increase in amortization expense resulting from the intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of the mdhc companies which were reflected in our results for the entire fiscal period as well as an increase in marketing expenses 
income from operations income from operations for fiscal increased by million to million from million for fiscal taxes an income tax provision of million and million was recorded for fiscal and  respectively 
the effective income tax rates were and for fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the statutory federal income tax rate resulting from an increase in taxable income 
net income net income for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal

pursuant to the terms under our managed care agreements with certain of our hmo affiliates  we posted irrevocable standby letters of credit amounting to million to secure our payment obligations to those hmos 
we are required to maintain these letters of credit throughout the term of the managed care agreements 
in may and june  our board of directors increased our previously announced program to authorize the repurchase of an additional  and  shares of our common stock  respectively  bringing the total number of shares of common stock authorized for repurchase under the program to  shares 
any such repurchases will be made from time to time at the discretion of our management in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions and other factors 
we anticipate that any such repurchases of shares will be funded through cash from operations 
during fiscal we repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million 
we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during fiscal as of august   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million 
we believe that we will be able to fund our capital commitments and our anticipated operating cash requirements for the foreseeable future and satisfy any remaining obligations from our working capital  anticipated cash flows from operations  our credit facility  and our term loans

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at june   we held certificates of deposit and cash equivalent investments in high grade  short term securities  which are not typically subject to material market risk 
at june   we had capital lease obligations outstanding at fixed rates 
for loans with fixed interest rates  a hypothetical change in interest rates would have no material impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments and would have an immaterial impact on the fair value of these instruments 
our term loans and credit facility have variable interest rates and are interest rate sensitive  however  we had no amount outstanding under these facilities at june  we have no material risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates or commodity prices
