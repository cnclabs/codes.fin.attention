overview apollo investment was incorporated under the maryland general corporation law in february we have elected to be treated as a bdc under the act 
as such  we are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements 
for instance  we generally have to invest at least of our total assets in qualifying assets  including securities of private or thinly traded public us companies  cash equivalents  us government securities and high quality debt investments that mature in one year or less 
in addition  for federal income tax purposes we have elected to be treated as a ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
pursuant to this election and assuming we qualify as a ric  we generally do not have to pay corporate level federal income taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders 
apollo investment commenced operations on april  upon completion of its initial public offering that raised million in net proceeds selling million shares of its common stock at a price of per share 
since then  and through march   we have raised an additional billion in net proceeds from additional offerings of common stock 
investments our level of investment activity can and does vary substantially from period to period depending on many factors  including the amount of debt and equity capital available to middle market companies  the level of merger and acquisition activity for such companies  the general economic environment and the competitive environment for the types of investments we make 

table of contents as a business development company  we must not acquire any assets other than qualifying assets specified in the act unless  at the time the acquisition is made  at least of our total assets are qualifying assets with certain limited exceptions 
qualifying assets include investments in eligible portfolio companies 
pursuant to rules adopted in  the sec expanded the definition of eligible portfolio company to include certain public companies that do not have any securities listed on a national securities exchange 
the sec recently adopted an additional new rule under the act to expand the definition of eligible portfolio company to include companies whose securities are listed on a national securities exchange but whose market capitalization is less than million 
this new rule will become effective july  revenue we generate revenue primarily in the form of interest and dividend income from the debt and preferred securities we hold and capital gains  if any  on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies 
our debt investments  whether in the form of mezzanine or senior secured loans  generally have a stated term of five to ten years and bear interest at a fixed rate or a floating rate usually determined on the basis of a benchmark libor  euribor  gbp libor  or the prime rate 
while us subordinated debt and corporate notes typically accrue interest at fixed rates  some of these investments may include zero coupon  payment in kind pik and or step up bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis 
interest on debt securities is generally payable quarterly or semiannually 
in some cases  some of our investments provide for deferred interest payments or pik 
the principal amount of the debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest generally becomes due at the maturity date 
in addition  we may generate revenue in the form of dividends paid to us on common equity investments as well as revenue in the form of commitment  origination  structuring fees  fees for providing managerial assistance and  if applicable  consulting fees  etc 
expenses all investment professionals of the investment adviser and their staff  when and to the extent engaged in providing investment advisory and management services to us  and the compensation and routine overhead expenses of that personnel which is allocable to those services are provided and paid for by aim 
we bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions  including those relating to investment advisory and management fees  expenses incurred by apollo investment management payable to third parties  including agents  consultants or other advisors  in monitoring our financial and legal affairs and in monitoring our investments and performing due diligence on our prospective portfolio companies  calculation of our net asset value including the cost and expenses of any independent valuation firm  direct costs and expenses of administration  including auditor and legal costs  costs of preparing and filing reports or other documents with the sec  interest payable on debt  if any  incurred to finance our investments  offerings of our common stock and other securities  registration and listing fees  fees payable to third parties  including agents  consultants or other advisors  relating to  or associated with  evaluating and making investments  transfer agent and custodial fees  taxes  independent directors fees and expenses  marketing and distribution related expenses  
table of contents the costs of any reports  proxy statements or other notices to stockholders  including printing and postage costs  our allocable portion of the fidelity bond  directors and officers errors and omissions liability insurance  and any other insurance premiums  organization and offering  and all other expenses incurred by us or apollo administration in connection with administering our business  such as our allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement  including rent and our allocable portion of the cost of our chief financial officer and chief compliance officer and their respective staffs 
we expect our general and administrative operating expenses related to our ongoing operations to increase moderately in dollar terms  but decline slightly as a percentage of our total assets in future periods if our assets grow 
incentive fees  interest expense and costs relating to future offerings of securities  among others  would be additive 
portfolio and investment activity during our fiscal year ended march   we invested billion  across new and numerous existing portfolio companies 
this compares to investing billion in new and several existing portfolio companies for the previous fiscal year ended march  investments sold or prepaid during the fiscal year ended march  totaled million versus million for the fiscal year ended march  at march   our net portfolio consisted of portfolio companies and was invested in senior secured loans  in subordinated debt  in preferred equity and in common equity and warrants versus portfolio companies invested in senior secured loans  in subordinated debt  in preferred equity and in common equity and warrants at march  the weighted average yields on our senior secured loan portfolio  subordinated debt portfolio and total debt portfolio at our current cost basis were  and  respectively  at march  at march   the yields were   and  respectively 
since the initial public offering of apollo investment corporation in april and through march   total invested capital exceeds billion in portfolio companies 
over the same period  apollo investment has also completed transactions with different financial sponsors 
senior secured loans and european mezzanine loans typically accrue interest at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark libor  euribor  gbp libor  or the prime rate  with stated maturities at origination that typically range from to years 
while subordinated debt issued within the united states will typically accrue interest at fixed rates  some of these investments may include zero coupon  pik and or step bonds that accrue income on a constant yield to call or maturity basis 
at march   or billion of our interest bearing investment portfolio is fixed rate debt and or billion is floating rate debt 
at march   or billion of our interest bearing investment portfolio was fixed rate debt and or billion was floating rate debt 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
changes 
table of contents in the economic environment  financial markets and any other parameters used in determining such estimates could cause actual results to differ materially 
in addition to the discussion below  our critical accounting policies are further described in the notes to the financial statements 
valuation of portfolio investments as a business development company  we generally invest in illiquid or thinly traded securities including debt and equity securities of middle market companies 
under procedures established by our board of directors  we value investments  including certain subordinated debt  senior secured debt and other debt securities with maturities greater than days  for which market quotations are readily available  at such market quotations unless they are deemed not to represent fair value 
we obtain market quotations from independent pricing services or use the mean between the bid and ask prices obtained from at least two brokers or dealers if available  otherwise by a principal market maker or a primary market dealer 
from time to time  we may also utilize independent third party valuation firms to determine fair value if and when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value 
debt and equity securities that are not publicly traded or whose market prices are not readily available are valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors 
such determination of fair values may involve subjective judgments and estimates 
investments purchased within days of maturity are valued at cost plus accreted discount  or minus amortized premium  which approximates value 
with respect to unquoted securities  our board of directors  together with our independent valuation advisers value each investment considering  among other measures  discounted cash flow models  comparisons of financial ratios of peer companies that are public and other factors 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering or subsequent equity sale occurs  our board  together with our independent valuation advisers consider the pricing indicated by the external event to corroborate and or assist us in our valuation 
because we expect that there will not be a readily available market for many of the investments in our portfolio  we expect to value many of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith by or under the direction of our board of directors pursuant to a valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process utilizing the input of the investment adviser  independent valuation firms and the audit committee 
due to the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily available fair market value  the value of our investments may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a readily available market value existed for such investments  and the differences could be material 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are not deemed to represent fair value  our board of directors has approved a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the investment professionals responsible for the portfolio investment  preliminary valuation conclusions are then documented and discussed with our senior management  independent valuation firms engaged by our board of directors conduct independent appraisals and review management s preliminary valuations and their own independent assessment  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuation of our investment adviser and that of the independent valuation firms and responds and supplements the valuation recommendation of the independent valuation firm to reflect any comments  and the board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of our investment adviser  the respective independent valuation firms and the audit committee 
in september   the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  fair value measurements  which assists in clarifying the definition of fair value and requires companies to expand their disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in 
table of contents interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition 
adoption of sfas generally requires the use of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we continue to analyze the effect of adoption of this statement on our financial position  including our net asset value and results of operations  but currently believe that it will not have a significant impact on our financial position  including our net asset value and results of operations 
we will adopt this statement on a prospective basis beginning in the quarter ending june  the actual impact on our financial statements in the period of adoption and subsequent to the period of adoption cannot be determined at this time as it will be influenced by the estimates of fair value for that period and the number and amount of investments we originate  acquire or exit 
revenue recognition we record interest and dividend income on an accrual basis to the extent that we expect to collect such amounts 
for loans and securities with contractual pik interest or dividends  which represents contractual interest or dividends accrued and added to the loan balance that generally becomes due at maturity  we may not accrue pik income if the portfolio company valuation indicates that the pik income is not collectible 
we do not accrue as a receivable interest or dividends on loans and securities if we have reason to doubt our ability to collect such income 
loan origination fees  original issue discount  and market discount are capitalized and then we amortize such amounts as interest income 
upon the prepayment of a loan or security  any unamortized loan origination fees are recorded as interest income 
we record prepayment premiums on loans and securities as interest income when we receive such amounts 
net realized gains or losses and net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation we measure realized gains or losses by the difference between the net proceeds from the repayment or sale and the amortized cost basis of the investment  without regard to unrealized appreciation or depreciation previously recognized  but considering unamortized upfront fees and prepayment penalties 
net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflects the change in portfolio investment values during the reporting period  including the reversal of previously recorded unrealized appreciation or depreciation  when gains or losses are realized 
within the context of these critical accounting policies  we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported

table of contents dividends dividends paid to stockholders for the fiscal years ended march   and totaled million or per share  million or per share  and million or per share  respectively 
the following table summarizes our quarterly dividends paid to stockholders for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively declared dividends fiscal year ending march  fourth fiscal quarter third fiscal quarter second fiscal quarter first fiscal quarter fiscal year ending march  fourth fiscal quarter third fiscal quarter second fiscal quarter first fiscal quarter fiscal year ending march  fourth fiscal quarter third fiscal quarter second fiscal quarter first fiscal quarter tax characteristics of all dividends will be reported to stockholders on form after the end of the calendar year 
we intend to continue to distribute quarterly dividends to our stockholders 
our quarterly dividends  if any  will be determined by our board of directors 
we have elected to be taxed as a ric under subchapter m of the internal revenue code of to maintain our ric status  we must distribute at least of our ordinary income and realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any  out of the assets legally available for distribution 
in addition  although we currently intend to distribute realized net capital gains ie  net long term capital gains in excess of short term capital losses  if any  at least annually  out of the assets legally available for such distributions  we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment 
we maintain an opt out dividend reinvestment plan for our common stockholders 
as a result  if we declare a dividend  then stockholders cash dividends will be automatically reinvested in additional shares of our common stock  unless they specifically opt out of the dividend reinvestment plan so as to receive cash dividends 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make dividends and distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these dividends and distributions from time to time 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to make dividends and distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings when applicable to us as a business development company under the act and due to provisions in future credit facilities 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of our ric status 
we cannot assure stockholders that they will receive any dividends and distributions or dividends and distributions at a particular level 
with respect to the dividends paid to stockholders  income from origination  structuring  closing  commitment and other upfront fees associated with investments in portfolio companies is treated as taxable income and accordingly  distributed to stockholders 
for the fiscal years ended march   and upfront fees 
table of contents totaling million  million and million  respectively  are being amortized into income over the lives of their respective loans to the extent such loans remain outstanding 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
during the fiscal year ended march   many of the loans in our portfolio had floating interest rates 
these loans are usually based on a floating libo rate and typically have durations of one to six months after which they reset to current market interest rates 
as the percentage of our mezzanine and other subordinated loans increase as a percentage of our total investments  we expect that more of the loans in our portfolio will have fixed rates 
accordingly  we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options  swaps and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of lower interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
during the fiscal year ended march   we did not engage in interest rate hedging activities
