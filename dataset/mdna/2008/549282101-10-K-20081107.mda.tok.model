item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal years ended august   august   and august  included in item of this report 
overview we generated  in fiscal year  revenues primarily by providing quality food to customers at our restaurants located throughout texas and three other states 
these establishments are located in close proximity to retail centers  business developments and residential areas 
we also provide culinary contract services for organizations that offer on site food service  such as health care facilities 
since august  we have introduced our new cafeteria style prototype design in four locations 
three of these locations are new sites and one a replacement site 
our financial results during fiscal year were negatively impacted by the challenging restaurant operating environment 
over the past seven quarters  we have experienced a same store sales decline on average of  this decline follows a period of twelve consecutive quarters when we averaged an increase of per quarter 
our sales continued to be negatively impacted by softer consumer demand  which has been negatively impacted by higher gasoline prices and higher commodity costs for consumers during the year 
same store restaurant sales declined for fiscal year compared to fiscal year the negative trend in consumer spending that resulted in reduced unit traffic continued throughout fiscal year and was partially offset by higher menu prices 
fiscal year expenses were negatively impacted by higher food  labor  operating expenses and depreciation  as well as higher general and administrative expenses food costs were higher in fiscal year due to significantly higher commodity prices which were only partially offset by menu price increases labor costs were impacted by higher wage rates due to the minimum wage increase and an increase in store management at certain locations as part of our efforts to improve store level operations operating expenses were higher primarily due to increased utility rates as a result of higher costs of natural gas which impacted our gas and electricity costs 
also contributing to higher operating expenses were increased repairs and maintenance expenditures driven by existing unit remodeling efforts in fiscal year  and higher restaurant supplies expense as a result of our efforts at the store level to improve the standardization of our kitchens 
these increases were only partially offset by lower marketing and advertising costs as a result of our focus on lower cost marketing mediums during fiscal year depreciation expense increased significantly as a result of new and existing unit capital expenditures activity in fiscal year general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased staffing associated with our growth plan and higher professional expenses associated with proxy solicitation in fiscal year consistent with our business plan for fiscal year  we invested in upgrades to our existing stores  built new restaurants and grew our culinary contract services business using cash flow from operations 
expanding our brand and investing in our business continues to be our long term plan 
in light of current global economic conditions  however  we are focusing on managing capital allocations conservatively and maintaining a healthy balance sheet 
we have taken a conservative approach to our capital allocation in fiscal year for new unit development and store upgrades and now expect to significantly reduce our capital expenditures in the current fiscal year 
our current plans are to open one or two new restaurants in fiscal year we believe our operational execution has improved through the higher standards we have committed to delivering for our customers and over the long term will enhance shareholder value 

table of contents during fiscal year  we opened two additional new prototype restaurants and incorporated the new prototype features into one restaurant relocated within a retail center 
in fiscal year  we spent million on capital expenditures  which included million in restaurant upgrades such as dining room updates  restroom remodels and the addition of new furniture 
we remain committed to our operational procedures  policies and initiatives designed to strengthen and grow our business 
these programs are focused on customer service  menu innovation  food quality assurance  technological enhancements and staff training and development 
the long term consistent execution of these programs is designed to enhance overall customer satisfaction and increase profitability 
accounting periods our fiscal year ends on the last wednesday in august 
as such  each fiscal year normally consists of four week periods  or accounting periods  accounting for days in the aggregate 
each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year consists of three four week periods  while the fourth quarter normally consists of four four week periods 
fiscal years  and all contained weeks 
comparability between quarters may be affected by the varying lengths of the quarters  as well as the seasonality associated with the restaurant business 
same store sales the restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to food quality  concept  location  price  and service  all of which may have an effect on same store sales 
our same store sales calculation measures the relative performance of a certain group of restaurants 
to qualify for inclusion in this group  a store must have been in operation for consecutive accounting periods 
stores that close on a permanent basis are removed from the group in the fiscal quarter when operations cease at the restaurant  but remain in the same store group for previously reported fiscal quarters 
although management believes this approach leads to more effective year over year comparisons  neither the time frame nor the exact practice may be similar to those used by other restaurant companies 
same store sales decreased for fiscal year  decreased for fiscal year and increased for fiscal year the following table shows the same store sales change for comparative historical quarters increase decrease fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year q q q q q q q q q q q q same store sales minimum wage increase impact the second of three federal minimum wage increases took effect on july  we expect to experience a compression due to these minimum wage increases  meaning that wages earned by employees within a certain range of the new minimum wage would be adjusted over time as the new minimum wage increases are phased in through calendar year to the extent prevailing market conditions allow  we intend to adjust menu prices to maintain profit margins 
discontinued operations our business plan  as approved in fiscal year and completed in fiscal year  called for the closure of more than locations 
in accordance with the plan  the entire fiscal activity of the applicable stores closed after the inception of the plan has been classified as discontinued operations 
results related to these same locations have also been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 

table of contents recent events hurricane ike stuck southeast texas in september causing massive power outages and inflicting wide spread damage in the greater houston area 
approximately luby s locations in the houston area were closed over varying lengths of time due to the storm 
we anticipate that restaurant sales were negatively impacted by approximately days in the aggregate when some of our locations were unable to open due to storm damage or loss of power 
we estimate approximately million in lost sales from these store closures 
we also estimate storm related direct costs of million to million for damages  auxiliary power  food loss and other miscellaneous costs 
we are seeking to recover a portion of lost profits  property damages  and some expenses incurred through insurance claims

other income  net other income  net  consisted primarily of the following components net rental property income and expenses relating to property for which we are the landlord  prepaid sales tax discounts earned through our participation in state tax prepayment programs  and de recognition of gift certificate liability resulting from the expiration of state statutes of limitation on gift certificate amounts

our income tax benefit in fiscal year primarily represents the recognition of tax benefits for net operating losses not recognized in previous years due to uncertainty regarding our ability to realize them 
discontinued operations the net loss from discontinued operations decreased by approximately million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  principally due to lease settlement and asset impairment costs associated with discontinued operations in liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents and short term investments general 
our primary sources of short term and long term liquidity are cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility 
our cash requirements consist principally of capital expenditures for new store development and construction  restaurant renovations and upgrades and information technology  and working capital 
a continued decline in our cash flow from operations could require us to utilize our credit facility 
under the current terms of our revolving credit facility  capital expenditures and the amount of borrowings are limited based on our trailing cash flows  as defined in the agreement 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and our vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets 

table of contents cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to million from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
this decrease is primarily due to the change in classification of the fair value of auction rate securities from short term investments to long term investments and sales of short term investments during fiscal year see note  cash and cash equivalents  investments and trade receivables to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
we generally reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new restaurants or enhance existing restaurants 
the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities year ended august  august  august  in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
in fiscal year  operating cash flow decreased million to million compared to fiscal year  primarily due to a decline in restaurant sales and increased restaurant expenses and general and administrative expenses 
investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  primarily due to increased purchases of property and equipment  which includes new restaurant construction in progress  partially offset by decreased purchases of short term investments 
our capital expenditure program includes  among other things  investments in new locations  restaurant remodeling  and information technology enhancements 
we used million for purchases of property and equipment in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year we expect to spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures in fiscal year financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities increased million to million  compared to fiscal year  due primarily to proceeds from the exercise of stock options partially offset by the purchase of treasury stock 
status of long term investments and liquidity at august   we held million  par value million  fair value in auction rate municipal bond securities as long term investments 
these securities are long term bonds with underlying maturities in years through but have historically had short term features intended for the investor s liquidity 
prior to the collapse of the auction rate securities market in february  these bonds were purchased or sold through a dutch auction process in short term intervals of  or days  whereby the interest rate on the security is reset 
the prevailing market auction failures resulted in the long term investments classification and an other than temporary impairment loss of million 
for additional information  see note  cash and cash equivalents  investments and trade receivables to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
given our current cash position  liquid cash equivalents  expected future cash flow from operations and our available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  we believe the current and near term illiquidity of the auction rate municipal bonds will not adversely affect management s ability to achieve its operating goals 

table of contents status of trade accounts and other receivables  net we monitor our receivables aging and record provisions for uncollectability as appropriate 
credit terms of accounts receivable associated with our culinary contract service business vary from to days based on contract terms 
working capital we had a working capital deficit of million as of august   compared to a working capital deficit of million as of august   primarily due to the reclassification of our million auction rate municipal bonds from short term to long term investments 
we expect to meet our working capital requirements through cash flows from operations and availability under the revolving credit facility 
capital expenditures capital expenditures consist of purchases of real estate for future restaurant sites  new units construction  purchases of new and replacement restaurant furniture and equipment  and ongoing remodeling programs 
capital expenditures for fiscal year were approximately million  and related to maintaining our investment in existing operating units as well as constructing new units 
we expect to be able to fund all capital expenditures in fiscal year using cash flows from operations and our available credit 
we expect to spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures in fiscal year stock purchases on february   in a privately negotiated block trade  the company purchased  shares of common stock for million 
debt revolving credit facility on july   we entered into a new million unsecured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with a syndicate of two banks 
the revolving credit facility may  subject to certain terms and conditions  be increased by an additional million for a total facility size of million 
the revolving credit facility allows for up to million of the available credit to be extended in the form of letters of credit 
all amounts owed by us under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by our subsidiaries and must be repaid in full upon the maturity date on june  at any time throughout the term of the facility  we have the option to elect one of two bases of interest rates 
one interest rate option is the greater of a the federal funds effective rate plus  or b prime  plus  in either case  an applicable spread that ranges from zero to per annum 
the other interest rate option is libor london interbank offered rate plus a spread that ranges from to per annum 
the applicable spread under each option is dependent upon certain measures of our financial performance at the time of each election 
we pay a quarterly commitment fee based on the unused available balance of the revolving credit facility  which is also dependent upon our leverage ratio  ranging from to per annum 
we also pay quarterly fees with respect to any letters of credit issued and outstanding 
finally  we were obligated to pay the lenders a one time fee in connection with the closing of the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility contains customary covenants and restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities  including financial performance covenants and limitations on capital expenditures  asset sales and acquisitions and contains customary events of default 
as of august   we were in compliance with all covenants and our banks had the ability to provide any requested loans

commitments and contingencies off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
pending claims certain current and former hourly restaurant employees filed a lawsuit against us in texas federal court alleging violations of the fair labor standards act with respect to the inclusion of certain employees in a tip pool 
the lawsuit seeks penalties and attorney s fees and was conditionally certified as a collective action in october we intend to vigorously defend our position 
it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss  if any 
from time to time  we are subject to various other private lawsuits  administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
a number of these lawsuits  proceedings and claims may exist at any given time 
these matters typically involve claims from guests  employees and others related to issues common to the restaurant industry 
at this time  management believes that the ultimate resolution of pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
construction activity from time to time  we enter into non cancelable contracts for the construction of our new restaurants 
this construction activity exposes us to the risks inherent in new construction including but not limited to rising material prices  labor shortages  delays in getting required permits and inspections  adverse weather conditions  and injuries sustained by workers

critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note  nature of operations and significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements in item of part ii of this report 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies due to the significant  subjective and complex judgments and estimates used when preparing our consolidated financial statements 
management regularly reviews these assumptions and estimates with the finance and audit committee of our board of directors 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  as interpreted by fin we record the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carrybacks and carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities temporary differences and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we periodically review the recoverability of tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide valuation allowances as management deems necessary 
we make judgments regarding the interpretation of tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions as well as by the internal revenue service 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all open tax years 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
we believe that we have adequately provided for reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
there are no audits or reviews currently underway in any jurisdiction for any fiscal years 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we estimate future cash flows expected to result from the use and possible disposition of the asset and will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows is less than the carrying amounts of such assets 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
the span of time for which future cash flows are estimated is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
we consider the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset as determined by discounted cash flows or appraisals  if available 

table of contents investments we invest in two types of securities  held to maturity and available for sale 
securities held to maturity are reported at amortized cost 
avaliable for sale securities are reported at fair value 
fair value is a subjective estimate based on our judgement 
securities available for sale consist of auction rate securities 
declines in fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities are analyzed to determine if the decline is temporary or other than temporary 
temporary unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in shareholders equity 
other than temporary declines reduce earnings 
any increases in other than temporary declines in fair value will not be realized until the securities are sold 
property held for sale we also periodically review long lived assets against our plans to retain or ultimately dispose of properties 
if we decide to dispose of a property  it will be moved to property held for sale and actively marketed 
property held for sale is recorded at amounts not in excess of what management currently expects to receive upon sale  less costs of disposal 
we routinely monitor the estimated value of property held for sale and record adjustments to these values as required 
we periodically measure and analyze our estimates against third party appraisals 
insurance and claims we self insure a significant portion of risks and associated liabilities under our employee injury  workers compensation and general liability programs 
we maintain insurance coverage with third party carriers to limit our per occurrence claim exposure 
we have recorded accrued liabilities for self insurance based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates  and we review these amounts on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
the significant assumptions made by the actuary to estimate self insurance reserves  including incurred but not reported claims  are as follows historical patterns of loss development will continue in the future as they have in the past loss development method  historical trend patterns and loss cost levels will continue in the future as they have in the past bornhuetter ferguson method  and historical claim counts and exposures are used to calculate historical frequency rates and average claim costs are analyzed to get a projected severity frequency and severity method 
the results of these methods are blended by the actuary to provide the reserves estimates 
actual workers compensation and employee injury claims expense may differ from estimated loss provisions 
the ultimate level of claims under the in house safety program are not known  and declines in incidence of claims as well as claims costs experiences or reductions in reserve requirements under the program may not continue in future periods

many ingredients in the products sold in our restaurants are commodities  subject to unpredictable price fluctuations 
we attempt to minimize price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients and in some cases by passing increased commodity costs through to the customer by adjusting menu prices or menu offerings 
our ingredients are available from multiple suppliers so we are not dependant on a single vendor for our ingredients
