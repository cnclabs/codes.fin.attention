the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a provider of storage systems for organizations requiring high reliability  high performance networked storage and data management solutions in an open systems architecture 
our storage solutions products consist of integrated hardware and firmware employing a modular system that allows end users to add capacity as needed 
our products provide end users with a cost effective means of addressing increasing storage demands without sacrificing performance 
our new product family based on our r evolution architecture provides high performance and large capacities for a broad variety of environments 
our sannet products have been distinguished by certification as nebs level a telecommunications standard for equipment used in central offices and are mil std f a military standard created by the us government compliant based on their ruggedness and reliability 
our products and services are sold worldwide to end users through our channel partners  which consist primarily of oems  supplemented by sis and vars 
our oem channel partners currently include  among others  sun netapp  fujitsu siemens  hp  motorola  nec  sepaton and stratus 
we have been shipping our products to sun for resale to sun s customers since october and continue to do so  having shipped over  units to date 
over the past year we have experienced a decline in revenues from sun 
pursuant to our development and oem supply agreement with netapp  we are designing and developing general purpose disk arrays for a variety of products to be sold under private label by netapp 
we began shipping products to netapp under the agreement for general availability in the third quarter of and expect revenues from netapp to increase in pursuant to our master purchase agreement with fujitsu siemens  we are jointly developing with fujitsu siemens storage solutions utilizing key components and patented technologies from dot hill 
we began shipping products to fujitsu siemens under the agreement in july in january  we entered into an agreement with hp to provide private label  entry level raid storage arrays to hp 
we expect to begin shipping products to hp under the agreement in the second quarter of in connection with the agreement  we issued a five year warrant to hp to purchase  shares of dot hill s common stock approximately of dot hill s outstanding shares prior to the issuance of the warrant 
our agreements with our channel partners do not contain any minimum purchase commitments and may be terminated at any time upon notice from the applicable partner 
our ability to achieve a return to profitability will 
table of contents depend on the level of orders we actually receive from our channel partners  the actual amounts we spend for inventory support and incremental internal investment  our ability to reduce product cost  our product lead time and our ability to meet delivery schedules required by our channel partners 
our strategy includes outsourcing substantially all of our manufacturing to third party manufacturers in order to reduce sales cycle times and manufacturing infrastructure  enhance working capital and improve margins by taking advantage of the third party s manufacturing and procurement economies of scale 
since  we have outsourced substantially all of our manufacturing operations to solectron  which was subsequently purchased by flextronics 
in february  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with mitac  a leading provider of contract manufacturing and original design manufacturing services  and synnex  a leading global it supply chain services company 
under the terms of the agreement  mitac will supply dot hill with manufacturing  assembly and test services from its facilities in china and synnex will provide dot hill with final assembly  testing and configure to order services through its facilities in fremont  california and telford  united kingdom 
we believe that the agreement with mitac and synnex will facilitate our strategic product initiatives  help to expand our global capabilities and further reduce our manufacturing costs 
we began shipping products for general availability under the mitac and synnex agreement in all of our series and series r evolution products are now manufactured by these partners 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of our sannet ii family of products and we are in the process of transitioning sannet ii customers to our family of products 
we derive a portion of our revenue from services associated with the maintenance service we provide for our installed products 
in may  we entered into a services agreement with anacomp to provide all maintenance  warranty and non warranty services for our sannet i and certain legacy products 
we recently entered into an agreement with gavs to provide warranty and non warranty services for customers who purchase new maintenance agreements for our prior generation sannet product family as well as our new r evolution platform 
anacomp  our current service provider  will manage our sannet i support for our non warranty customers 
cost of goods sold includes costs of materials  subcontractor costs  salary and related benefits for the production and service departments  depreciation and amortization of equipment used in the production and service departments  production facility rent and allocation of overhead 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions  advertising and promotional costs and travel expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of project related expenses and salaries for employees directly engaged in research and development 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation to officers and employees performing administrative functions  expenditures for administrative facilities as well as expenditures for legal and accounting services and fluctuations in currency valuations 
other income is comprised primarily of interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
in august  we merged with artecon and we changed our name from box hill systems corp 
to dot hill systems corp 
we reincorporated in delaware in our headquarters is located in carlsbad  california  and we maintain international offices in germany  japan  the netherlands  china and the united kingdom 
on february   we completed the acquisition of chaparral  a privately held developer of specialized storage appliances as well as high performance  mid range raid controllers and data routers 
the total transaction cost of approximately million consisted of a payment of approximately million in cash  the assumption of approximately million related to obligations due certain employees covered by change in control agreements  approximately million of direct transaction costs and approximately million of accrued integration costs 
we believe the acquisition of chaparral has enabled us to increase the amount of proprietary technology within our storage systems  broaden our product line and diversify our customer base 
we introduced the during the third quarter of the is the first product developed and launched based on the technology acquired from chaparral and is also the first in a family of offerings focused on the incorporation of sas and sata drive technology in the same infrastructure with a variety of front end host interfaces 
we are now shipping the product to over a dozen customers  including fujitsu siemens  and shipped over  units in 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and use judgment that may impact the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
as a part of our on going internal processes  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory write downs  warranty cost accruals  revenue recognition  bad debt allowances  long lived assets valuation  goodwill and intangible assets valuation  income taxes  including deferred income tax asset valuation  stock based compensation  litigation and contingencies 
we base these estimates upon both historical information and other assumptions that we believe are valid and reasonable under the circumstances 
these assumptions form the basis for making judgments and determining the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize product revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii our price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue for product sales upon transfer of title to the customer 
customer purchase orders and or contracts are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and the completion of any customer acceptance requirements  when applicable  are used to verify product delivery or that services have been rendered 
we assess whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess the collectibility of our accounts receivable based primarily upon the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
revenue from product maintenance contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contract term  generally to months 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data  and other factors known at the time 
historically these amounts have not been material 
we maintain inventory  or hubbing arrangements with certain of our customers 
pursuant to these arrangements we deliver products to a customer or a designated third party warehouse based upon the customer s projected needs  but do not recognize product revenue unless and until the customer reports that it has removed our product from the warehouse to incorporate into its end products 
if a customer does not take our product under a hubbing arrangement in accordance with the schedule it originally provided to us  our future revenue stream could vary substantially from our forecasts and our results of operations could be materially affected 
in july  we received an upfront nonrefundable payment from one of our customers in the amount of million 
this amount represented a reimbursement for production test equipment and tooling that will be utilized over the term of the agreement to manufacture product for this customer 
the upfront nonrefundable payment will be deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
valuation of inventories inventories are comprised of purchased parts and assemblies  which include direct labor and overhead 
we record inventories at the lower of cost or market value  with cost generally determined on a first in  first out basis 
we establish inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves could be required 
under the hubbing arrangements that we maintain with certain customers  we own inventory that is physically located in a customer s or third party s warehouse 
as a 
table of contents result  our ability to effectively manage inventory levels may be impaired  which would cause our total inventory turns to decrease 
in that event  our expenses associated with excess and obsolete inventory could increase and our cash flow could be negatively impacted 
valuation of goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of the income approach and the market capitalization approach 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we must record an impairment charge equal to the difference 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future discounted cash flows 
under the market capitalization approach  valuation multiples are calculated based on operating data from publicly traded companies within our industry 
multiples derived from companies within our industry provide an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for a company 
these multiples are applied to the operating data for the reporting unit to arrive at an indicated fair value 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the estimated future discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
we base our fair value estimates on forecasted revenue and operating costs along with the business plan for fiscal through fiscal our forecasts consider the effect of a number of factors including  but not limited to  the effect of the roll out of new products  securing new customers  the effect of the transition to a new contract manufacturer  the ability to reduce product costs and the impact of continued cost savings measures within operating expenses 
it is possible  however  that the plans may change that actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
on a quarterly basis throughout we performed a step one impairment test of the goodwill related to our sannet reporting unit through september  based upon the results of our impairment tests  management concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value  and therefore the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required for any quarters through september  for example  for the quarter ended september   our valuation indicated a fair value of million compared to our book value of million 
our step one estimate of fair value using a blend of both the income approach and the market capitalization approach indicated a fair value of million compared to our book value of million as of our measurement date of november  the market value of our common stock declined each quarter during the current year  from a closing stock price of per share at december  to a closing stock price of per share at september  the primary reason for the decline in our valuation from september  to november  was due to the continued decline in the closing stock price of our stock to per share at november   representing a decline 
as a result of these declines  management determined that the goodwill related to its sannet reporting unit was impaired and the second step of the goodwill impairment test was performed to measure the amount of the impairment  resulting in the recognition of an impairment to goodwill of million 
deferred taxes we utilize the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial performance 
as a result of our cumulative losses in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions  we have concluded that a full valuation allowance 
table of contents against our net deferred tax assets is appropriate in such jurisdictions 
in certain other foreign jurisdictions where we do not have cumulative losses  we record valuation allowances to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in the future  if we realize a deferred tax asset that currently carries a valuation allowance  we may record a reduction to income tax expense in the period of such realization 
in july the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which requires income tax positions to meet a more likely than not recognition threshold to be recognized in the financial statements 
under fin  tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not threshold should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
prior to we recorded estimated income tax liabilities to the extent they were probable and could be reasonably estimated 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions  and the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions 
if we ultimately determine that the payment of these liabilities will be unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine the liability no longer applies 
conversely  we record additional tax charges in a period in which we determine that a recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities or deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
stock based compensation through december   we accounted for stock based compensation under the intrinsic method in accordance with accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the intrinsic method  we did not record any expenses as the exercise price of stock options granted equaled the fair market value of our stock at the date of grant 
on december   we accelerated vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share that were previously awarded under our equity compensation plans to our employees 
these options were accelerated to avoid recording future compensation expense with respect to such options following adoption of sfas no 
r as discussed below 
our management believes that because such options had exercise prices in excess of the current market value of our stock  the options were not achieving their original objective 
the acceleration of vesting was effective for stock options outstanding as of december  options to purchase million shares of common stock were subject to the acceleration and the weighted average exercise price of the options subject to the acceleration was 
due to this acceleration  an additional million is included in the pro forma stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees  directors and consultants  including stock option grants and purchases of stock made pursuant to our amended and restated equity incentive plan  or the eip  our amended and restated non employee directors stock option plan  or the nedsop  and our amended and restated employee stock purchase plan  or the espp  based on estimated fair values 
sfas no 
r supercedes our previous accounting under apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in march  the sec issued sab no 
 share based payment  and we have applied sab no 
s provisions in our adoption of sfas no 
r 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january  as further described below 
in accordance with the modified 
table of contents prospective transition method  our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires us to record stock compensation expense for equity based awards granted  including stock options  for which expense will be recognized over the service period of the equity based award based on the fair value of the award  at the date of grant 
the estimation of stock option fair value requires management to make complex estimates and judgments about  among other things  employee exercise behavior  forfeiture rates  and the volatility of our common stock 
these judgments directly affect the amount of compensation expense that will ultimately be recognized 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our stock options 
the black scholes model meets the requirements of sfas r but the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our stock options as it does not consider certain factors important to those awards to employees  such as continued employment and periodic vesting requirements as well as limited transferability 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we use the implied volatility for traded options on our stock as the expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model 
our selection of the implied volatility approach is based on the availability of data regarding actively traded options on our stock as well as we believe that implied volatility is more representative than historical volatility 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
we will evaluate the assumptions used to value stock options on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
to the extent that we grant additional stock options to employees our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
as of december   total unrecognized share based compensation cost related to unvested stock options was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
contingencies from time to time we are involved in disputes  litigation and other legal proceedings 
we prosecute and defend these matters aggressively 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
in addition  the resolution of intellectual property litigation may require us to pay damages for past infringement or to obtain a license under the other party s intellectual property rights that could require one time license fees or running royalties  which could adversely impact gross profit and gross margins in future periods  or could prevent us from manufacturing or selling some of our products 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for a loss contingency when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  the actual liability in any such disputes or litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional costs 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain items from our statements of operations as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated in thousands year ended december  net revenue cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative legal settlement goodwill impairment charges operating loss other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss percentages may not add due to rounding year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net revenue from our sannet ii products declined from million for the year ended december  to million for year ended december  the decrease in net revenue for both sannet ii and overall revenue was primarily attributable to decreased orders for our products from our largest oem customer  sun  who sells our products under the st brand product line 
for the year ended december   net revenue from sun accounted for of our net revenue or million  as compared to or million of our net revenue for the year ended december  the primary driver for the decline in sun net revenue is due to the products nearing the end of their lifecycle and no follow on products for the st line have been developed to date 
in terms of sannet ii unit sales  fibre channel units shipped were  for the year ended december  compared to  units for the year ended december  scsi units shipped were  for the year ended december  compared to  units for the year ended december  blade units shipped were  for the year ended december  compared to  units for the year ended december  sata units shipped were for the year ended december  compared to  units for the year ended december  the decrease in net revenue from sun was partially offset by increased net revenue from our series products  a new family of products introduced during the third quarter of  and net revenue to another large oem customer  netapp 
net revenue for our series products increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  we shipped  units of our series products for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in units and net revenue from our series products was driven primarily by new design wins during and representing the first full year of product shipments 
net revenue from netapp for the year ended december  was million  or of net revenue  up from million  or of net revenue  during the year ended december  the rapid growth in 
table of contents netapp net revenue was driven by netapp s product launch during the third quarter of the net revenue during the year ended december  was from pre production units purchased by netapp for testing and evaluation 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  cost of goods sold increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in the dollar amount of cost of goods sold was primarily attributable to a decrease in net revenue 
the increase in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a change in the product sales mix 
net revenue on our highest margin product sales to sun and other sannet ii customers declined as a percentage of total net revenue 
sun net revenue declined from of net revenue for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this was replaced by lower margin net revenue sales of our series products and sales to netapp 
net revenue from our series products and netapp represented of net revenue for the year ended december  versus for the year ended december  margins on our series products for the year ended december  were lower than the corporate average due to two factors 
first  we were in the process of transitioning the manufacturing of our series products from flextronics to mitac and synnex in order to take advantage of lower manufacturing costs 
this transition was completed during the fourth quarter of we also experienced higher inventory reserves  scrap and warranty expenses related to the series products 
second  our historical experience indicates that gross margins on new products sold to new customers start out low initially and increase over the first several quarters as a result of maturing manufacturing processes  component cost reductions and value engineering the products to reduce costs 
thereafter the margin improvements are generally more modest 
during we experienced improved margins on the series products throughout the year 
the margins on our business with netapp were also below corporate averages for two primary reasons 
first  the products we sell to netapp do not include higher margin value added features such as raid controllers 
second  similar to the series products  we are very early in the lifecycle of these products as they were launched during the third quarter of and our historical experience indicates that gross margins on new products start out low initially and increase over the first several quarters as a result of maturing manufacturing processes  component cost reductions and value engineering the products to reduce costs 
gross profit gross profit decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  gross profit decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in the dollar amount of gross profit as percentage of net revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a reduction in overall net revenue and a change in the product sales mix which lowered the overall gross profit as a percentage of net revenue 
the reduction in gross profit percentage was primarily driven by a change in product sales mix 
net revenue on our highest margin product sales to sun declined as a percentage of total net revenue from of net revenue for the year ended december  to of net revenue for the year ended december  this was replaced by lower margin net revenue from our series products and netapp 
net revenues from our series products and netapp represented of net revenue for the year ended december  versus of net revenue for the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses were relatively flat at million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  sales and marketing expenses increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended 
table of contents december  the decrease in the dollar amount of sales and marketing expenses was primarily attributable to a decrease in advertising  intangible amortization and payroll related expenses offset by increases in professional fees and stock based compensation expense 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to a decrease in net revenue for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  research and development expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in research and development expenses both in dollar amounts and as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to a reduction of million in investment in prototypes and project materials 
in we had increased levels of prototype and project materials expenses as we prepared netapp products and our series products for volume production 
in addition the decrease was due to a reduction of million in test related expenses  million in third party professional and consulting fees and a reduction of million for travel related expenses 
we expect research and development expenses for the year ending december  will increase from spending levels incurred during due to the investment in prototype expenses and engineering staff associated with the requirements of our amended agreement with hp 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of net revenue  general and administrative expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in both dollar amounts and as a percentage of net revenue was primarily attributable to a million decrease in legal expense  a million reduction in stock based compensation expense  a million reduction in recruiting  third party consulting and professional fees  a million gain due to currency revaluation of intercompany transactions and a million reduction in payroll related expenses  offset by a million increase in accounting tax related expenses 
legal settlement expense on june   we entered into a settlement and license agreement with crossroads that settles crossroads lawsuit against us and licenses to us the family of patents from which it stemmed 
we concurrently entered into an agreement between dot hill systems and infortrend re settlement of crossroads lawsuit with infortrend 
in accordance with the crossroads and infortrend agreements  on july   we paid million to crossroads for alleged past damages and crossroads agreed to dismiss all patent claims against us 
as part of the agreement between dot hill and infortrend  infortrend paid crossroads million on behalf of dot hill on july  million was paid by dot hill for taiwan taxes and is included in income tax expense on our statement of operations 
please refer to note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment charge for the year ended december   we performed an impairment test of the goodwill related to our sannet reporting unit for each quarter through september  based upon the results of our impairment tests  management concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value  and therefore the second step of the goodwill impairment test was not required for any quarters through september  during the fourth quarter of the market value of our common stock substantially declined 
as a result of this decline we determined that the goodwill related to our sannet reporting unit was impaired and the second step of the goodwill impairment test was performed to measure the amount of the impairment resulting in the recognition of an impairment to goodwill of million 

table of contents other income other income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income of million due to a million reduction in our cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by a increase in other income expense  net of million 
income taxes we recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  compared to income tax expense of million for the year ended december  our effective income tax rate of for the year ended december  differs from the us federal statutory rate due to our us and foreign deferred tax asset valuation allowance position  foreign taxes and state taxes 
for the year ended december   we recorded a tax expense of million 
the expense was comprised principally of a million discrete income tax expense associated with the establishment of full valuation allowances for united states deferred tax assets 
our effective income tax rate of for the year ended december  differs from the us federal statutory rate due to the discrete tax expense associated with the establishment of valuation allowances related to united states deferred tax assets  our valuation allowance against operations taxed in foreign jurisdictions  foreign taxes and state taxes 
at december   based on the weight of available evidence  including cumulative losses in recent years and expectations of future taxable income  we determined that it was not more likely than not that our united states deferred tax assets would be realized and have a million valuation allowance associated with our united states deferred tax assets 
as of december   the company has federal and state net operating losses of approximately million and million  which begin to expire in the tax years ending and  respectively 
in addition  the company has federal tax credit carryforwards of million  of which approximately million can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income  and the remaining million will begin to expire in the tax year ending the company also has state tax credit carryforwards of million  of which million can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income  and the remaining million will begin to expire in the tax year ending as a result of our equity transactions  an ownership change  within the meaning of irc section  occurred on september  as a result  annual use of our federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards is limited to i the aggregate fair market value of dot hill immediately before the ownership change multiplied by ii the long term tax exempt rate within the meaning of section f of the irc in effect at that time 
the annual limitation is cumulative and  therefore  if not fully utilized in a year  can be utilized in future years in addition to the section limitation for those years 
as a result of our acquisition of chaparral  a second ownership change  within the meaning of irc section  occurred on february  as a result  annual use of chaparral s federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards may be limited 
the annual limitation is cumulative and  therefore  if not fully utilized in a year  can be utilized in future years in addition to the section limitation for those years 
we have not provided for any residual us income taxes on the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested 
such residual us income taxes  if any  would be insignificant

other income other income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in interest income of million due to higher interest rates  partially offset by a decrease in other income expense  net of million 
income taxes we recognized an income tax expense of million for the year ended december  the expense was comprised of a million discrete tax expense associated with the establishment of full valuation allowances for united states deferred tax assets 
our effective income tax rate of for the year ended december  differs from the united states federal statutory rate due to this million discrete tax expense associated with the establishment of valuation allowances related to united states deferred tax assets  our valuation allowance against operations taxed in foreign jurisdictions  foreign taxes and state taxes 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets  and adjust the carrying amount of the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent the future realization of the deferred tax assets is judged to be more likely than not 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income or loss  the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  and other relevant factors 
as of december   we had previously reversed a valuation allowance on our united states deferred tax assets totaling million 
based on the nature of the underlying deferred tax assets  the reversal of the valuation allowance resulted in an increase to additional paid in capital of million  a reduction of goodwill in the amount of million  and a net income tax benefit of million 
this reversal was the result of our recent sustained history of operating profitability as of december  and the determination by management at that time that the future realization of the net deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
consistent with the december  analysis  at september  we weighted the cumulative earnings evidence and forecasted future earnings evidence as the most significant factors in its analysis of the recoverability of its united states deferred tax assets in due to changes in  we determined that there was an overall 
table of contents greater proportional weight of negative evidence rather than positive evidence 
based on the expected cumulative three year united states pre tax loss as of december  and the anticipated losses in  we concluded that we did not have objective  verifiable evidence of sufficient future taxable income to recover our united states deferred tax assets 
as a result  we determined that as of september  it was not more likely than not that our united states deferred tax assets would be realized and re established a million valuation allowance associated with our united states deferred tax assets 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating losses of approximately million and million  which begin to expire in the tax years ending and  respectively 
in addition  we had federal tax credit carryforwards of million  of which approximately million could be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income  and the remaining million will begin to expire in the tax year ending we also have state tax credit carryforwards of million  of which million can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future taxable income  and the remaining million will begin to expire in the tax year ending we exercise significant judgment relating to the projection of future taxable income to determine the recoverability of any tax assets recorded on the balance sheet 
as a result of our equity transactions  an ownership change  within the meaning of irc section  occurred on september  as a result  annual use of our federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards is limited to i the aggregate fair market value of dot hill immediately before the ownership change multiplied by ii the long term tax exempt rate within the meaning of section f of the irc in effect at that time 
the annual limitation is cumulative and  therefore  if not fully utilized in a year  can be utilized in future years in addition to the section limitation for those years 
as a result of our acquisition of chaparral  a second ownership change  within the meaning of irc section  occurred on february  as a result  annual use of chaparral s federal net operating loss and credit carry forwards may be limited 
the annual limitation is cumulative and  therefore  if not fully utilized in a year  can be utilized in future years in addition to the section limitation for those years 
we have not provided for any residual united states income taxes on the earnings from our foreign subsidiaries because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested 
such residual united states income taxes  if any  would be insignificant 
liquidity and capital resources the two primary drivers affecting liquidity and cash are working capital requirements and net profits or losses 
historically  the payment terms we have had to offer its customer s have been relatively similar to the terms received from creditors and suppliers 
we typically bill customers on an open account basis subject to our standard net thirty day payment terms 
if in the longer term  our revenue increases  it is likely that our accounts receivable balance will also increase 
our accounts receivable could further increase if customers delay their payments or if we grant extended payment terms to customers 
furthermore  we have had to maintain only a small amount of inventory  as our customer s for the most part took delivery of products directly from our contract manufacturer s facility 
in however  we started to hub inventory for some of our larger customer s and consequently the growth in inventory has started to become a use of cash 
in the future  our inventory levels will continue to be determined based upon the level of purchase orders we receive  our ability  and the ability of our customers  specifically netapp  hp and fujitsu siemens  to manage inventory under hubbing arrangements  as well as competitive situations in the marketplace 
such considerations are balanced against the risk of obsolescence or potentially excess inventory levels 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of working capital 
cash equivalents include highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less and consist principally of money market funds and commercial paper 
for the year ended december   cash used in operating activities was million compared to cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  the net cash used in operating activities in was attributable to the net loss of million consisting of cash and non cash activities 
the operating activities that affected cash consisted primarily of lower revenues and gross profit 
the non cash operating 
table of contents activities included in the net loss that did not affect cash consisted of the following  goodwill impairment charge of million  depreciation and amortization of million  share based compensation expense of million  and loss on disposition of property and equipment of million 
cash flow from operations reflects the positive impact of million related to an overall decrease in accounts receivable due to lower revenues in as compared to and the timing of payments from our customers  a million decrease in prepaid and other assets due to a reduction of million in prepaid purchase price variance and a million reduction in prepaid insurance  offset by an increase in prepaid interest of million and various software maintenance contracts of million  a million increase in deferred revenues primarily due to a customer deposit 
additionally  other liabilities increased million primarily due to an increase in deferred rent related to our new longmont  co facility of million  a million increase due to a customer deposit offset by a decrease of million in deferred rent for our carlsbad  ca facility and a million decrease in our fin liability 
cash provided from operations was negatively impacted by a million reduction in accounts payable due to the timing of payments to our vendors as well as lower sales volume  and a million increase in inventory primarily due to the creation of hub inventory locations for certain of our customers 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million of cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  cash used for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to cash paid for leasehold improvements at our longmont  co facility of million and equipment and tooling purchases of million 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  the cash provided by financing activities is attributable to the proceeds received from the exercises of stock options under our equity incentive plans and warrants of million  and the proceeds received from the sale of common stock to employees under our employee stock purchase plan of million 
we presently expect cash  cash equivalents and cash generated from operations to be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months and for operating periods in excess of months 
in addition  this will enable us to pursue acquisitions or capital improvements 
the actual amount and timing of working capital and capital expenditures that we may incur in future periods may vary significantly and will depend upon numerous factors  including the amount and timing of the receipt of net revenue from continued operations  our ability to manage our relationships with third party manufacturers  the status of our relationships with key customers  partners and suppliers  the timing and extent of the introduction of new products and services and growth in personnel and operations 
on april   we entered into a lease contract with circle capital longmont llc  under which we lease approximately  square feet of office and laboratory space located at south sunset in longmont  colorado 
we use this office and laboratory space as our new research and development facility 
the lease contract provides for a term of months  commencing in august and ending december our operating lease commitments will increase by million per year for each of the years ended december  through the lease for our previous research and development faculty located in longmont  colorado expired in accordance with the lease terms on july  effective july   we amended our credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association  or wells fargo  which allows us to borrow up to million under a revolving line of credit that expires july  amounts loaned under the credit agreement bear interest at our option at a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the prime rate in effect from time to time  or at a fixed rate per annum determined by wells fargo to be above libor in effect on the first day of the applicable fixed rate term 
in connection with the credit agreement  to the extent we have outstanding borrowings  we have granted wells fargo a security interest in our investment management account maintained with wells capital management incorporated 
as of december  and december   there were no balances outstanding under this line of credit 
the credit agreement limits any new borrowings  loans  or advances outside of the credit agreement to an amount less than million and annual capital expenditures to an amount less than million

payments due and contractual obligations total thereafter operating lease obligations settlement payments for purposes of the table above  the operating lease obligations exclude common area maintenance  real estate taxes and insurance expenses 
settlement payments represent payments to be made in connection with a certain vendor settlement agreement whereby we are obligated to purchase  units of power supplies

we maintain indemnification agreements with certain of our oem customers related to intellectual property and product liability 
in addition to the amounts shown in the table above  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been recorded as liabilities in accordance with fin  and we are uncertain as to if or when such amounts may be settled 
at december   we did not have any relationship with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance variable interest  or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we did not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and credit risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio 
our primary investment strategy is to preserve the principal amounts invested  maximize investment yields subject to other investment objectives and maintain liquidity to meet projected cash requirements 
accordingly  we invest in instruments such as money market funds  certificates of deposit  united states government agencies bonds  notes  bills and municipal bonds that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
our investment policy also limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer and type of instrument 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and we do not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes

foreign currency exchange rate risk a portion of our international business is presently conducted in currencies other than the united states dollar 
our international businesses operate primarily in  euros  british pounds and japanese yen 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from normal business operations are credited to or charged against earnings in the period incurred 
as a result  fluctuations in the value of the currencies in which we conduct our business relative to the united states dollar will cause currency transaction gains and losses  which we have experienced in the past and continue to experience 
due to the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates  among other factors  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon future operating results 
there can be no assurances that we will not experience currency losses in the future 
we have not previously undertaken hedging transactions to cover currency exposure and we currently do not intend to engage in hedging activities in the near future 

table of contents we regularly pursue new customers in various locations where new opportunities for storage networks are planned 
as a result  a significant portion of our revenues are derived from north american customers  with our north american customers accounting for approximately of our net sales during fiscal  of our fiscal net sales and of our fiscal net sales 
the locations of our international customers include europe and asia  where there has been historical volatility in several of the regions currencies 
changes in the value of the us dollar versus the local currency in which our products are sold exposes us to foreign currency risk since the weakening of an international customer s local currency and banking market may negatively impact such customer s ability to meet their payment obligations to us 
in addition  certain of our international customers require that we transact business with them in their own local currency  regardless of the location of our operations  which also exposes us to foreign currency risk 
as we sell products or services in foreign currencies  we are regularly required to convert the payments received into us dollars or utilize such foreign currencies as payments for expenses of our business  which gives rise to foreign exchange gains and losses 
given the uncertainty as to when and what specific foreign currencies we may be required or decide to accept as payment from our international customers  we cannot predict the ultimate impact that such a decision would have on our business  gross margins and results of operations 
while we monitor our foreign currency exposures  we do not currently maintain an active foreign currency hedging program
