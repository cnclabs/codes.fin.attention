overview business we are a global leader in the design  manufacture and service of technology based solutions for the upstream energy industry 
we seek to change the way people drill wells by delivering safer and more efficient solutions that add real value by reducing the costs of drilling for and producing oil and gas 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we organize our activities into three business segments  top drive  casing services and research and engineering  and our financial and operating data are presented consistent with that structure 
the top drive business comprises top drive sales  top drive rentals and after market sales and service 
the casing services business includes casing drilling and our proprietary and conventional tubular services 
the research and engineering r e segment is comprised of our research and development activities related to our proprietary technologies in casing services and top drive model development 
for a detailed description of these business segments  see part i  item business above 
revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase is primarily due to increased activities in the top drive segment  particularly top drive sales and after market sales and support due to the substantial increase in the top drive unit sales and increased activity in the casing services segment particularly  our proprietary casing services activities 
included in casing drilling revenues for is million from contract casing drilling activities which were discontinued in operating income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in  a decrease of million 
this decrease is primarily attributable to decreased operating income in casing services  increased costs in our research and engineering segment and increased selling  general and administrative expenses which were partially offset by increased operating income from top drives 
results for each business segment are discussed in further detail below 
net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to million in  or per diluted share  an increase of million 
other than the changes in operating income discussed above  in we benefited from a million benefit related to return to accrual adjustments as a result of filing our canadian  us and other foreign tax returns and the reversal of million in accrued interest and penalties related to the favorable resolution of a mexico tax claim  partially offset by a million foreign exchange loss related to the us dollar receivables held by our canadian operations and the weakening of the us dollar during the period  a million charge related to a reduction in deferred tax assets attributable to reduced statutory tax rates for canadian federal taxes and a million loss related to the expiration of the turnkey e p warrants 
additionally  our net income included an accrual of million related to a withholding taxes and penalties related to payments over the period from to in a foreign jurisdiction  an interest expense accrual of million in arising out of a claim for foreign withholding tax on payments made over the period from to and a million charge related to a reduction in deferred tax assets attributable to reduced statutory tax rates for both canadian federal and provincial alberta taxes 
business environment strong oil and gas drilling activity in continued to provide significant opportunities for us to expand our customer base 
one of the key indicators of our business is the number of active drilling rigs 
the average annual number of active drilling rigs excluding rigs drilling in russia or onshore china for which reliable estimates are not available is as follows years ended december  united states canada latin america including mexico europe  africa and middle east asia pacific worldwide average source baker hughes rig count 
table of contents 
index to financial statements during  north america average rig activity was flat even though canada experienced a decline in rig activity 
however the international markets continued to expand 
as a result  we continued our emphasis of increasing revenues and operating income outside of north america to create a more balanced portfolio between the north american and the international markets 
our financial performance  as measured in revenues and operating income for both business segments  in north america and throughout the rest of the world  reflects this change in focus that has been made over the last few years 
for example  our revenues outside of north america consisting of canada and the us increased to million compared to  and our revenues increased to million as compared to according to world oil  drilling activity for the last three years and forecast for is for the years ended december  forecast wells drilled us canada latin america europe  n 
africa  middle east far east worldwide forecast released by world oil on january  we believe that the anticipated continuing strength in drilling activity and  in particular  well complexity provides significant opportunities for us 
we are committed to expanding our role as a leading service provider to the drilling industry 
all of our services and products are delivered through geographic business units to provide customers with a single point of contact for all of our products and services 
we continue to see strong demand for all our products 
in north america rig activity is at a twenty year high and the demand for top drives  both sales and rentals  remain strong 
demand for our proprietary tubular services also remains strong due primarily to our technology differentiation 
while our conventional tubular services business in the us remains steady  competition for services and personnel have impacted our ability to increase prices to cover rising costs 
even though the overall north american market remained strong throughout  we have seen a weakening in the gulf of mexico and canadian markets 
the weakness in the gulf of mexico markets has negatively impacted our business  but in the canadian markets  our casing services segment has grown despite the general industry slowdown 
on the casing drilling front  our current activity has recently increased 
internationally  demand for all our services is strong 
the increased rig count throughout coupled with the increased complexity of wells drilled indicates a strong market for all our products and services 
outlook during  we delivered new top drive units to customers  compared to new units delivered to customers in we ended with a backlog of top drive units compared to a backlog of units at december  our backlog since mid has declined as a consequence of significantly increasing our manufacturing capacity to to top drives per month  to meet both our customer and internal demand and our sales efforts not increasing at the same rate as our manufacturing capacity 
we believe that for our top drive business  a backlog of two quarters of production is reasonable and allows us to effectively manage our supply chain and workforce  yet be responsive to our client base 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we continue to see increasing demand for rental top drives internationally 
therefore  we plan to increase our fleet size to approximately units and to continue to evaluate the allocation of our fleet throughout the world 
additionally  subject to market conditions  we intend to revitalize our top drive rental fleet by selling certain used units and replacing them with newer models 
we will manage our fleet revitalization program such that disruptions to our rental operations are minimized 
based on current market activity  we believe that new unit sales will be similar to we continue to focus on lowering our manufacturing costs through better international sourcing and to find ways to minimize the impact of the fluctuations in the value of the us dollar on our sales margins 
for our top drive after market sales and services business  we expect a continuing increase as our third party installed base continues to expand around the globe 
our increased manufacturing capacity since mid has increased the number of top drive units sold to customers and has increased our installed base throughout the world  providing expansion opportunities for our after market sales and service business 
also  over the last three years  our average revenue per top drive unit sale has increased due to a shift in market demand to larger  more complex units 
these factors have driven our increase in inventory levels 
we believe that our top drive business needs to maintain manufacturing inventory of two quarters of production to limit our exposure in the event that the sales market softens and allows us to effectively manage our supply chain and workforce 
in addition  we must maintain additional inventory of long lead time items and semi finished goods to support our after market business and for our manufacturing operations 
during the installation of a new inventory planning and purchasing system at our manufacturing plant in  we experienced implementation problems with our purchasing process that caused inventory to increase significantly above desired levels at december  we believe that during  our inventory levels will return to desired levels 
we continue to move our casing services business forward with new customers in both tubular services and casing drilling 
on the tubular services front  we expect our cds proprietary casing running business and mclrs activities to increase in compared to and our conventional activity to remain at a level consistent with we continue to address the high cost structure of our north american tubular services business by optimizing personnel and assets in operating areas that provide the highest returns 
additionally  we continue to expand our tubular services activities in selected international locations 
however  as we experienced in  our tubular services margins are impacted by competition for the retention and recruitment of experienced personnel cost pressures and in our ability to increase prices to offset cost inflation 
with respect to our casing drilling business  we are continuing our investment and believe that its performance should improve in compared to during  we incurred a substantial expense to build our resource base to grow casing drilling at a faster rate 
we believe that these investments will yield growth in our casing drilling revenues in

revenues revenue for the year ended december  increased million compared to  primarily driven by a million increase in top drive sales  a million increase in top drive after market support and a million increase in top drive rental operations 
revenues from top drive sales increased million  or  to million as compared to  primarily the result of the sale of units in compared to units during during  we sold top drive units  of which were new units and were used units 
during  we sold top drive units  of which were new units and eight were used units 
the selling price per unit varies significantly depending on the model  whether the unit was previously operated in our rental fleet and whether a power unit was included in the sale 
when top drive units in our rental fleet are sold  the sales proceeds are included in revenues and the net book value of the equipment sold is included in cost of sales and services 
revenues related to the sale of used units sold in and were million and million  respectively 
in addition to selling top drive units  we provide after market sales and service to support our installed base 
revenues from top drive after market support increased million  or  to million as compared to  primarily due to the increase in our third party installed base and our efforts to expand this service 

table of contents 
index to financial statements revenues from top drive rental activities increased million  or  to million as compared to  primarily due to higher average rental rates offset by a decrease in the number of operating days 
the decrease in rental days was due to the increased number of used units sold in and  for units that were replaced  the time lag between when the used units were removed from operations to be prepared for sale and when the new units are mobilized for operations 
the number of top drive operating days and average daily operating rates for and and the number of rental units in our fleet at year end and were years ended december  number of operating days average daily operating rates number of units in rental fleet  end of year we define an operating day as a day that a unit in our rental fleet is under contract and operating 
we do not include stand by days in our definition of an operating day 
a stand by day is a day in which we are paid an amount  which may be less than the full contract rate  to have a top drive rental unit available to a customer but that unit is not operating 
in  stand by revenues from rental operations decreased million to million due to demand for our top drive rental units 
operating income top drive operating income for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to this increase was primarily driven by the increase in the number of top drive units sold in compared to units in compared to units in  higher sales margins on our used top drive sales and the reversal of million in warranty reserves  partially offset by increased manufacturing costs of our top drives and lower margins in our rental business due to costs related to reallocating our fleet from north american markets to international markets  start up costs related to new contracts in certain international markets  particularly mexico  and increased maintenance  refurbishment and recertification costs due to the high utilization of our rental fleet 
our increased manufacturing costs were primarily driven by the weakening of the us dollar  as a majority of our manufacturing costs are incurred in canadian dollars  and increased costs associated with the disruption of installing a new planning system in our manufacturing plant earlier in the year and the introduction of the two new x series top drives into production 
the reversal of certain of our warranty reserve in relates to reserves originally provided in related to load path parts of certain equipment sold to customers and used in our rental fleet and in to correct technical problems with our emi top drives as substantially all of our warranty work was completed at december  for further description of the reversal of certain warranty reserves  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii
