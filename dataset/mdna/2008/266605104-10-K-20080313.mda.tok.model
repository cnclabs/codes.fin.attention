overview we are an emerging specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the development of pharmaceutical systems based on proprietary drug delivery technology platforms 
we are developing and commercializing pharmaceutical systems that will deliver the right drug to the right place in the right amount at the right time to treat chronic or episodic diseases and conditions 
by integrating chemistry and engineering advancements  we seek to achieve what drugs or devices alone cannot 
our pharmaceutical systems enable optimized therapy for a given disease or patient population by controlling the rate and duration of drug administration and providing sustained drug delivery 
in addition to developing our own proprietary products  we enter into strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical companies to develop and commercialize proprietary and enhanced pharmaceutical products based on our technologies 
we have five disclosed on going product candidates in development of which four are in collaboration with third party pharmaceutical companies 
the following are our publicly announced product candidates in development posidur our post operative pain relief depot  posidur  is a sustained release injectable using our saber delivery system to deliver bupivacaine  an off patent anesthetic agent 
saber is a patented controlled drug delivery technology that can be formulated for systemic or local administration of drugs via the parenteral ie  injectable route 
posidur is designed to be administered to a surgical site at the time of surgery for post operative pain relief and is intended to provide local analgesia for up to days  which we believe coincides with the time period of the greatest need for post surgical pain control in most patients 
in november  we entered into a collaboration agreement with nycomed danmark  aps 
under the terms of the agreement  we licensed to nycomed the exclusive commercialization rights to posidur for the european union eu and select other countries 
nycomed paid us an upfront license fee of million in and an million milestone payment in triggered by achievement of a clinical development milestone  with future potential additional milestone payments of up to million upon achievement of note posidur  saber  transdur  oradur  eladur  durin  chronogesic  microdur  alzet and lactel are trademarks of durect corporation 
other trademarks referred to belong to their respective owners 

table of contents defined development  regulatory and sales milestones 
we jointly direct and equally fund with nycomed a development program for posidur intended to secure regulatory approval in both the us and the us in addition  we will manufacture and supply the product to nycomed for commercial sale in the territory licensed to nycomed 
nycomed will pay us blended royalties on sales in the defined territory of depending on annual sales  as well as a manufacturing markup 
we retain full commercial rights to posidur in the us  canada  asia and certain other countries 
in  we successfully completed a patient phase iib clinical trial of posidur for treatment of post operative pain in patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair 
in the phase iib trial  posidur at a dose of ml demonstrated statistically significant reductions in pain and in total consumption of supplemental opioid analgesic medications versus placebo 
these successful results triggered an million milestone payment by nycomed to us under our agreement with nycomed 
we have held an end of phase ii meeting with the fda and are in dialogue with the fda regarding our anticipated posidur phase iii program 
remoxy and other oradur based opioid products licensed to pain therapeutics in december  we entered into an agreement with pain therapeutics  amended in december  under which we granted pain therapeutics the exclusive  worldwide right to develop and commercialize selected long acting oral opioid products using our oradur technology incorporating four specified opioid drugs 
the first product being developed under the collaboration is remoxy  a novel long acting oral formulation of the opioid oxycodone targeted to decrease the potential for oxycodone abuse 
remoxy is intended for patients with chronic pain 
in december  pain therapeutics and king pharmaceuticals announced that the pivotal phase iii trial for remoxy successfully met its primary endpoint p that was prospectively defined by the us food and drug administration s fda during the special protocol assessment process 
in addition  the study achieved statistically significant results in secondary endpoints such as quality of analgesia p and global assessment p 
pain therapeutics has stated that they expect to file the nda for remoxy in the second quarter of during and  we also worked with king and pain therapeutics on the development of a second oradur abuse resistant opioid product 
in august  king and pain therapeutics announced the initiation of a phase i clinical trial for this oradur based opioid drug candidate  and that the ind application for this drug candidate had been accepted by the fda 
in november  pain therapeutics announced positive results from that phase i clinical trial 
transdur sufentanil our transdermal sufentanil patch transdur sufentanil uses our proprietary transdur delivery system to deliver sufentanil  an opioid medication 
transdur sufentanil is designed to provide extended chronic pain relief for up to seven days  as compared to the three days of relief provided with currently available opiate patches 
we anticipate that the small size of our sufentanil patch potentially as small as th the size of currently marketed transdermal fentanyl patches for a therapeutically equivalent dose may offer improved convenience and compliance for patients 
in  we successfully completed a phase ii clinical trial of transdur sufentanil in chronic pain 
in march  we entered into an agreement with endo pharmaceuticals endo granting endo exclusive rights to develop  market and commercialize transdur sufentanil in the us and canada 
endo has entered into an agreement with a contract manufacturer  m company m  related to manufacturing process development and scale up for transdur sufentanil 
endo commenced its phase ii program designed to evaluate the conversion of chronic pain patients treated with oral opioid products to transdur sufentanil in the second quarter of 
table of contents eladur our transdermal bupivacaine patch eladur uses our proprietary transdur transdermal technology and is intended to provide continuous delivery of bupivacaine for up to three days from a single application  as compared to a wearing time limited to hours with currently available lidocaine patches 
in  we successfully completed a patient phase iia clinical trial for eladur 
in this study of patients suffering from post herpetic neuralgia  eladur showed improved pain control versus placebo during the day continuous treatment period 
in addition  eladur appeared well tolerated overall  and patients treated with eladur and placebo exhibited similar safety profiles 
we are currently conducting manufacturing scale up and processing studies to secure additional phase ii and phase iii supplies  and are developing our clinical and regulatory strategy 
other programs memryte in july  we entered into a development and commercialization agreement with voyager under which we granted voyager the exclusive  worldwide rights to develop and commercialize a product  memryte  using the durin implant system to deliver the peptide leuprolide acetate to treat alzheimer s disease based on voyager s patented method of treatment 
effective january  we amended our agreement with voyager 
under the amendment  among other changes to the agreement  the royalty rate that we will receive on net sales of memryte  if commercialized  was doubled to of net sales after the amendment  and in addition  we will receive of any upfront  milestone and other fees received by voyager in the event that the product is sublicensed to a third party 
in return  we paid voyager million in cash and forgave approximately  which was owed to us for previously provided services 
in october  voyager initiated a phase iii clinical trial for memryte  but the phase iii trial was truncated by voyager in order to get an early look at potential efficacy 
in the second quarter of  voyager informed its shareholders that it has observed positive outcome trends among women  but no positive effect among men in voyager s truncated phase iii clinical trial for memryte 
based on these results  voyager has stated that it intends to focus its efforts on developing memryte for the treatment of alzheimer s disease in women and on seeking a potential collaborative partner for the program 
there can be no assurance that voyager or any other party will continue development of memryte 
chronogesic sufentanil pain therapy system the chronogesic sufentanil pain therapy system is an osmotic implant that is intended to continuously deliver sufentanil for an extended duration 
chronogesic is intended to treat chronic pain  and is based on the duros system  a miniature osmotic pump capable of continuously delivering drugs for up to a year in duration 
we have granted to endo exclusive commercialization rights for chronogesic in the us and canada 
in  we completed a pilot phase iii clinical trial for chronogesic 
clinical trials have been suspended pending system redesign which is on going 
our agreement with endo can be terminated by endo in the event that i we have not delivered to endo on or before march  a written notice that a human pharmacokinetic trial had been completed with chronogesic  together with a full study report of the results of the trial or ii endo  determines  in its sole discretion  to terminate the agreement during the sixty day period after our delivery of our notice  provided  that  in each case endo delivers to us its written notice of termination prior to april  we will not complete the requisite pharmacokinetic trial by march   which will give endo the right to terminate this agreement 
biologics programs the proteins and genes identified by the biotechnology industry are large  complex  intricate molecules  and many are unsuitable as drugs 
if these molecules are given orally  they are often digested before they can have an 
table of contents effect  if given by injection  they may be destroyed by the body s natural processes before they can reach their intended sites of action 
the body s natural elimination processes require frequent  high dose injections that may result in unwanted side effects 
as a result  the development of biotechnology molecules for the treatment of human diseases has been limited  and advanced drug delivery systems such as we possess are required to realize the full potential of many of these protein and peptide drugs 
we have active programs underway to apply our drug delivery systems to various biotechnology drugs and drug candidates  and have entered into a number of feasibility studies with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to test their products in our systems 
research programs in other therapeutic categories we have underway a number of research programs covering medical diseases and conditions other than pain 
such programs include various diseases and disorders of the central nervous system cns  including schizophrenia and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
another area of focus includes cardiovascular disease  including congestive heart failure 
in conducting our research programs and determining which particular efforts to prioritize for formal development  we employ a rigorous opportunity assessment process that takes into account the unmet medical need  commercial opportunity  technical feasibility  clinical viability  intellectual property considerations  and the development path including costs to achieve various critical milestones 
collaborative research and development revenues collaborative research and development revenues consist of three broad categories a the amortization of upfront license payments on a straight line basis over the period of our continuing involvement with the third party  b the reimbursement of qualified research expenses by third parties  and c milestone payments in connection with our collaborative agreements 
during the last two years  we generated substantially all collaborative research and development revenues from three collaborative agreements related to transdur sufentanil  remoxy and other specified oradur based oral opioids  and posidur 
due to the signing of the nycomed agreement related to posidur in november  a small amount of collaborative research and development revenue was recognized in from the amortization of the upfront payment of million received from nycomed 
in a full year of amortization was recognized 
however  in contrast to our other collaborations  due to the terms and nature of this collaboration  we will not recognize revenue from the reimbursement of qualified research expenses by nycomed 
rather  we will record research and development expense equal to our net share of the joint research and development expenses undertaken under the product development plan 
product revenues we currently generate product revenue from the sale of two product lines alzet osmotic pumps for animal research use  and lactel biodegradable polymers which are used by our customers as raw materials in their pharmaceutical and medical products 
because we consider our core business to be developing and commercializing pharmaceutical systems  we do not intend to significantly increase our investments in or efforts to sell or market any of our existing product lines 
however  we expect that we will continue to make efforts to increase our revenue related to collaborative research and development by entering into additional research and development agreements with third party partners to develop product candidates based on our drug delivery technologies 
since our inception in  we have had a history of operating losses 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million and our net losses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these losses have resulted primarily from costs incurred to research and develop our product candidates and to a lesser extent  from selling  general and administrative costs associated with our operations and product sales 
we expect our research and development 
table of contents expenses to increase in the near future as we expect to continue to expand our nonclinical studies  clinical trials and other research and development activities as well as to incur additional stock based compensation cost related to research and development personnel under sfas r 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in the near future due to expected increases in employee related costs to support our business activities and in stock based compensation cost related to selling  general and administrative personnel under sfas r 
we also expect to incur non cash expenses relating to amortization of intangible assets 
we do not anticipate revenues from our pharmaceutical systems  should they be approved  for at least the next twelve months 
therefore  we expect to incur continuing losses and negative cash flow from operations for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition  the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  accrued liabilities  contract research liabilities and stock based compensation 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of products is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the product is shipped and title transfers to customers  provided no continuing obligation exists  the price is fixed or determinable and the collectibility of the amounts owed is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products and license and collaboration agreements pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
multiple element agreements entered into are evaluated under the provision of eitf we evaluate whether there is stand alone value for the delivered elements and objective and reliable evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to each element in multiple element agreements 
when the delivered element does not have stand alone value or there is insufficient evidence of fair value for the undelivered element s  we recognize the consideration for the combined unit of accounting in the same manner as the revenue is recognized for the final deliverable  which is generally ratably over the longest period of involvement 
upfront payments received upon execution of collaborative agreements are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as collaborative research and development revenue based on a straight line basis over the period of our continuing involvement with the third party collaborator pursuant to the applicable agreement 
such period generally represents the research and development period set forth in the work plan defined in the respective agreements between us and our third party collaborators 
research and development revenue related to services performed under the collaborative arrangements with our corporate collaborators is recognized as the related research and development services are performed and the collectibility of the amounts owed is reasonably assured 
these research payments received under each respective agreement are not refundable and are generally based on reimbursement of qualified expenses  as defined in the agreements 
research and development expenses under the collaborative research and development agreements generally approximate or exceed the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
deferred revenue may result when we do not expend the required level of effort during a specific period in comparison to funds received under the respective agreement 
of note  in regard to our collaboration with nycomed  in contrast to our other collaborations  because we and nycomed jointly control and fund the development of posidur  we will not recognize revenue from the reimbursement of qualified research expenses from nycomed but instead those reimbursements receivable from nycomed will be recorded as a reduction in research and development expense 

table of contents milestone payments under collaborative arrangements are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the at risk milestone events  which represent the culmination of the earnings process related to that milestone 
milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research and development efforts or by events external to us  such as regulatory approval to market a product or the achievement of specified sales levels by a third party collaborator 
as such  the milestones are substantially at risk at the inception of the collaboration agreement  and the amounts of the payments assigned thereto are commensurate with the milestone achieved 
in addition  upon the achievement of a milestone event  we have no future performance obligations related to that milestone payment 
research and development expenses research and development expenses are primarily comprised of salaries and benefits associated with research and development personnel  overhead and facility costs  preclinical and non clinical development costs  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs  contract services  and other outside costs 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development costs paid to third parties under sponsored research agreements are recognized as expense as the related services are performed  generally ratably over the period of service 
in addition  reimbursements by nycomed for research and development expenses incurred by the company are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses 
research and development expenses incurred by nycomed and reimbursable by the company are recorded as an addition to the company s research and development expenses 
intangible assets and goodwill we record intangible assets when we acquire other companies 
the cost of an acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  including intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain intangible assets such as completed or core technologies are amortized over time  while acquired in process research and development is recorded as a one time charge on the acquisition date 
acquired in process research and development represents the value of research projects in process at the time of acquisition which have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use 
the determination of the amount of acquired in process research and development involves several estimates and judgments  including the percentage of completion of the in process technology and assumptions about future cash flows to be derived from the technology and discount rates 
different assumptions employed in determining the value of in process research and development could result in a greater or lesser amount being recorded 
goodwill is not amortized to expense but rather periodically assessed for impairment 
the allocation of the cost of an acquisition to intangible assets and goodwill therefore has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires the extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
we are also required to estimate the useful lives of those intangible assets subject to amortization  which determines the amount of amortization that will be recorded in a given future period and how quickly the total balance will be amortized 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our intangible assets 
a reduction in our estimate of remaining useful lives  if any  could result in increased amortization expense in future periods 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 

table of contents when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
the amount of any impairment charge is significantly impacted by and highly dependent upon assumptions as to future cash flows and the appropriate discount rate 
management believes that the discount rate used in this analysis is reasonable in light of currently available information 
the use of different assumptions or discount rates could result in a materially different impairment charge 
we perform a review for impairment of goodwill at least annually in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
no impairment of goodwill has been recorded through december  however  there can be no assurance that at the time other periodic reviews are completed  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
accrued liabilities and contract research liabilities we incur significant costs associated with third party consultants and organizations for pre clinical studies  clinical trials  contract manufacturing  validation  testing  and other research and development related services 
we are required to estimate periodically the cost of services rendered but unbilled based on management s estimates of project status 
if these good faith estimates are inaccurate  actual expenses incurred could materially differ from our estimates 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes a compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model 
as allowed by staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment  we have opted to use the simplified method for estimating our expected term equal to the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term of our stock options 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock  consistent with sfas r and sab we base the risk free rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
sfas r requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for options granted before january   we amortize the fair value on an accelerated basis 
for options granted on or after january   we amortize the fair value on a straight line basis 
all options are amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes option valuation model in the future  which could materially affect our net income or loss and net income or loss per share 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
under fin a company would recognize the benefit from a 
table of contents tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
fin clarifies how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized  provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits 
fin also addresses when a company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and penalties may be classified within the income statement and presented in the balance sheet 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and has been adopted by us effective january  pursuant to fin  the cumulative effects  if any  of applying fin would be recorded as an adjustment to accumulated deficit as of the beginning of the period of adoption 
we adopted fin effective january  as described in note the adoption of fin did not have any impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurement sfas requires prospective application for fiscal year ending december  in february  fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb no 
sfas 
the statement permits entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected would be reported in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements in order to facilitate comparisons between entities choosing different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas does not affect existing accounting requirements for certain assets and liabilities to be carried at fair value 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and is required to be adopted by us for the fiscal year ending december  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas no

it also provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
it is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and will be applied prospectively 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas r will have a material impact on our financial statements 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
net revenues were million in compared to million in the increase in total revenues in is primarily attributable to milestone revenue of million recognized from our nycomed collaboration related to posidur as well as increased collaborative research and development revenue from endo  from feasibility agreements with third parties and from the amortization of the nycomed upfront fee  partially offset by decreased collaborative research and development revenue from pain therapeutics and voyager 
collaborative research and development and other revenue we recognize revenues from collaborative research and development activities and service contracts

table of contents milestone payments associated with the license agreements 
the increase in collaborative research and development revenue in was primarily attributable to higher revenue recognized from amortization of the upfront fee received from nycomed and million of milestone payment in connection with our agreement for posidur  and higher collaborative research and development revenue recognized in connection with increased development activities associated with transdur sufentanil collaboration with endo and feasibility agreements  partially offset by decreased development activities for remoxy and other opioids collaboration with pain therapeutics and memryte collaboration with voyager  compared with we ceased to recognize collaborative research and development revenue related to memryte from august because the collectibility of the amounts owed was not reasonably assured 
we received a million upfront fee in connection with the license agreement signed with endo in march relating to transdur sufentanil 
the million upfront fee is recognized as collaborative research and development revenue ratably over the term of our continuing involvement with endo with respect to transdur sufentanil 
we recognized million in both and from amortization of the upfront fee 
the term of the continuing involvement has been estimated based on the product development plan pursuant to the agreement 
we also received a million upfront fee in connection with the development and license agreement with nycomed in november relating to posidur 
the million upfront fee is recognized as collaborative research and development revenue ratably over the term of our continuing involvement with nycomed with respect to posidur 
the amount recognized in as collaborative research and development revenue from the amortization of the upfront fee was million compared to  in the term of the continuing involvement has been estimated based on the product development plan pursuant to the agreement 
we expect our collaborative research and development revenue to fluctuate in future periods pending our efforts to enter into potential new collaborations and our existing third party collaborators commitment to and progress in the research and development programs 
the collaborative research and development and other revenues associated with our major collaborators are as follows in thousands year ended december  collaborator nycomed pain therapeutics  inc endo pharmaceuticals  inc voyager pharmaceutical corporation others total collaborative research and development and other revenue amounts related to amortization of upfront fees were million in and  in  respectively 
research and development expenses incurred by us in conjunction with the nycomed collaboration and reimbursable by nycomed are recorded as a reduction to total research and development expense 
the figure also includes million of milestone revenue recognized in connection with the nycomed agreement 
amounts related to amortization of upfront fees were million for and we amortize upfront fees on a straight line basis over the period in which we have continuing involvement with the third party collaborator pursuant to the applicable agreement 
such period generally represents the research and development period set forth in the work plan under each collaboration agreement between us and our third party collaborator 

table of contents milestone payments under collaborative arrangements are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone events  which represent the culmination of the earnings process related to that milestone

as such  the milestones are substantially at risk at the inception of the collaboration agreement  and the amounts of the payments assigned thereto are commensurate with the milestone achieved 
in addition  upon the achievement of a milestone event  we have no future performance obligations related to that milestone payment 
we recorded million of milestone revenue from our nycomed collaboration due to the achievement of a clinical development milestone for posidur in and  of milestone revenue from our collaboration with another third party collaborator in product revenue a portion of our revenues is derived from our product sales  which include our alzet mini pump product line  and to a lesser extent our lactel biodegradable polymer products 
net product revenues were million in compared with million in the increase was primarily due to higher lactel polymer sales in compared with alzet mini pump product sales remained comparable in both years

we cannot reasonably estimate the timing and costs of our research and development programs due to the risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical systems as outlined in the risk factors section of this report 
the duration of development of our research and development programs may span as many as ten years or more  and estimation of completion dates or costs to complete would be highly speculative and subjective due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products  including significant and changing government regulation  the uncertainties of future preclinical and clinical study results  the uncertainties with our collaborators commitment to and progress in the programs and the uncertainties associated with process development and manufacturing as well as sales and marketing 
in addition  with respect to our development programs subject to third party collaborations  the timing and expenditures to complete the programs are subject to the control of our collaborators 
therefore  we cannot reasonably estimate the timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the research and development programs

in the fourth quarter of  goodwill was evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas based on our evaluation  no indicators of impairment were noted 
should goodwill become impaired in the future  we would be required to record an impairment charge to write the goodwill down to its estimated fair value 
in december  we acquired from a third party a portfolio of worldwide patents relating to drug delivery technologies 
we paid  to this third party upon execution of the agreement 
we recorded  as intangible assets on our balance sheet as of december  and will amortize these patents over a useful life of years 
the net amount of other intangible assets at december  was  which will be amortized as follows  in each of the years ending december  and   for the year ending december   and  in each of the years ending december    and we periodically evaluate acquired intangible assets for impairment or obsolescence 
should the intangible assets become impaired or obsolete  we will write them down to their estimated fair value 
other income expense 
interest and other income was million in compared with million in the decrease in interest income was primarily the result of lower average cash and investment balances in compared with  partially offset by higher yields on our investments in interest expense was million in compared with million in the decrease in interest expense in was primarily due to lower remaining balances on our convertible notes in compared with due to the conversion of million in aggregate principal amount of convertible notes in debt conversion expense was  in compared with million in the debt conversion expense in was recorded in connection with the conversion of million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes into million shares of our common stock in the debt conversion expense in was recorded in connection with the conversion of million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes into million shares of our common stock in income taxes 
income tax provision was in both and as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  which expire in the years through and federal research and development tax credits of approximately million  which expire at various dates beginning in through  if not utilized 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purpose of approximately million  which expire in 
table of contents the years through and state research and development tax credits of approximately million  which do not expire 
utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to federal and state ownership change limitations 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
as of december  and  we had net deferred tax assets of million and million 
deferred tax assets reflect the net tax effects of net operating loss and credit carryforwards and the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon future earnings  if any  the timing and amount of which are uncertain 
accordingly  the net deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
because realization of such tax benefits is uncertain  we provided a valuation allowance as of december  and december  utilization of the nol and r d credits carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future provided by sections and of the internal revenue code of  as well as similar state and foreign provisions 
these ownership changes may limit the amount of nol and r d credits carryforwards that can be utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax  respectively 
in general  an ownership change  as defined by section  results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain shareholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than percentage points over a three year period 
since our formation  we have raised capital through the issuance of capital stock on several occasions which  combined with the purchasing shareholders subsequent disposition of those shares  may have resulted in a change of control  as defined by section  or could result in a change of control in the future upon subsequent disposition 
in addition  we issued million of convertible notes in and subsequently converted approximately million of these notes as of december  into our common stock in  and these transactions may also have resulted in a change of control or could result in a change of control in the future upon conversion of the notes to shares and subsequent disposition of the shares 
we have not currently completed a study to assess whether a change in control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of control since its formation due to the significant complexity and cost associated with such a study and that there could be additional changes in the future 
if we have experienced a change of control at any time since its formation  utilization of its nol or r d credits carryforwards would be subject to an annual limitation under sections and which is determined by first multiplying the value of our stock at the time of the ownership change by the applicable long term tax exempt rate  and then could be subject to additional adjustments  as required 
any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the nol or r d credits carryforwards before utilization 
further  until a study is completed and any limitation known  no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position under fin interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense

in november  we closed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share and received net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and related expenses 
in june and july  we completed a private placement of an aggregate of million in convertible subordinated notes 
the notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum and are due on june  the notes are convertible at the option of the note holders into our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes  or per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears in june and december 
we received net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting fees of million and related expenses of  the convertible subordinated notes are unsecured obligations of ours and are subordinate to any secured debt we currently have or any future senior debt we may have 
from the third quarter of through october  we exchanged an aggregate of approximately million in principal amount of our convertible subordinated notes in individually negotiated transactions with note holders  pursuant to which we issued approximately million shares of our common stock  and made cash payments in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
we may enter into similar transactions from time to time with holders of our convertible notes if we are able to do so on acceptable terms and depending on capital market conditions 
as of december   the remaining principal balance of our convertible subordinated notes was million  which is due on june  in conjunction with the acquisition of sbs in april  we assumed the sbs bonds with remaining principal payments of million as of april   and an interest rate of increasing each year up to at maturity on november  as part of the acquisition agreement  we were required to guarantee and collateralize these bonds with a letter of credit of approximately million that we secured with investments deposited with a financial institution in july interest payments are due semi annually and principal payments are due annually

we also anticipate incurring capital expenditures of approximately million over the next months to purchase research and development and manufacturing equipment 
the amount and timing of these capital expenditures will depend  among other things  on the success of clinical trials for our product candidates and our collaborative research and development activities 

table of contents we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our planned operations  existing debt and contractual commitments  and planned capital expenditures through at least the next months 
we may consume available resources more rapidly than currently anticipated  resulting in the need for additional funding 
additionally  we do not expect to generate revenues from our pharmaceutical systems currently under development for at least the next twelve months  if at all 
depending on the extent to which our convertible notes convert to common stock before they become due and payable in june and whether we enter into additional collaborative agreements in the near term  we may be required to raise additional capital through a variety of sources  including the public equity markets  private equity financings  collaborative arrangements  and or public or private debt 
there can be no assurance that our convertible notes will convert to common stock  we will enter into additional collaborative agreements in the near term or additional capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly reduce or refocus our operations or to obtain funds through arrangements that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our products  technologies or potential markets  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 
we have not utilized off balance sheet arrangements to fund our operations or otherwise manage our financial position 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible given these two constraints 
we satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
fixed rate securities and borrowings may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall and floating rate borrowings may lead to additional interest expense if interest rates increase 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
since our convertible notes bear interest at a fixed rate of per annum  the fair value of our convertible notes will fluctuate due to changes in interest rates and the price of our common stock 
our primary investment objective is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our portfolio includes money markets funds  commercial paper  medium term notes  corporate notes  government securities and corporate bonds 
the diversity of our portfolio helps us to achieve our investment objectives 
as of december   approximately of our investment portfolio is composed of investments with original maturities of one year or less and approximately of our investment portfolio matures less than days from the date of purchase
