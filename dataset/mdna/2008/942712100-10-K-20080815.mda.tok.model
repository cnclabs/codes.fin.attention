executive overview watson wyatt is a global consulting firm focusing on providing human capital and financial consulting services 
we provide services in five principal practice areas benefits  technology and administration solutions  human capital consulting  investment consulting and insurance and financial services  operating from countries throughout north america  europe  asia pacific  latin america  africa and the middle east 

table of contents in the short term  our revenues are driven by many factors including the general state of the global economy and the resulting level of discretionary spending by our clients  the ability of our consultants to attract new clients or cross sell to existing clients  and the impact of new regulations in the legal and accounting fields that most recently increased demand for our executive compensation and benefits practices 
in the long term  we expect that the company s financial results will depend in large part upon how well we succeed in deepening our existing client relationships through thought leadership and focus on cross practice solutions  actively pursuing new clients in our target markets  cross selling and strategic acquisitions 
we believe that the highly fragmented industry in which we operate represents tremendous growth opportunities for us  because we offer a unique business combination of benefits and human capital consulting as well as strategic technology solutions 
we design  develop and implement human resource strategies and programs through the following closely interrelated practice areas benefits group the benefits group  accounting for percent of our total fiscal year revenues  is the foundation of our business 
retirement  the core of our benefits group business  is less impacted by discretionary spending reductions than our other segments  mainly due to the recurring nature of client relationships 
our corporate client retention rate within our target market has remained very high 
revenue for our retirement practice is seasonal  with the second and third quarters of each fiscal year being the busier periods 
major revenue growth drivers in this practice include changes in regulations  particularly those affecting pension plans in the uk  leverage from other practices  increased global demand and increased market share 
technology and administration solutions group our technology and administration solutions group  accounting for percent of our total fiscal year revenues  provides information technology services to our customers 
human capital group our human capital group  accounting for percent of our total fiscal year revenues  generally encompasses short term projects

table of contents financial statement overview watson wyatt s fiscal year ends june the company has acquired many entities over the past three fiscal years including  wwllp  wwn and heissmann 
the wwllp business combination was completed july  and as a result  our financial statements reflect the consolidation of the european operations through watson wyatt limited beginning august  prior to july   or for one month of the first quarter of fiscal year  the company recorded its share of the results of wwllp and wwhe using the equity method of accounting 
this income is reflected in the income from affiliates line on our income statement 
our share of the results of our affiliated captive insurance company  professional consultants insurance company  inc pcic  continues to be recorded using the equity method of accounting  and is also reflected in the income from affiliates line 
wwn and heissmann were purchased on february  and july   respectively 
our financial statements reflect the consolidation of these two entities effective february  and july   respectively 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from fees for consulting services  which generally are billed based on time and materials or on a fixed fee basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis with revenue generally recognized as services are performed 
for fiscal years   and  no single client accounted for more than percent of our consolidated revenue for any of the most recent three fiscal years 
for the fiscal years ended june    and  the company s top six markets based on percentage of consolidated revenue were as follows fiscal year geographic region united states united kingdom germany canada netherlands greater china germany includes the revenue from heissmann which was acquired by the company in fiscal year in delivering consulting services  our principal direct expenses relate to compensation of personnel 
salaries and employee benefits are comprised of wages paid to associates  related taxes  benefit expenses such as pension  medical and insurance costs  and fiscal year end incentive bonuses 
professional and subcontracted services represent fees paid to external service providers for employment  marketing and other services  including reserves for professional liability claims 
for the last three fiscal years  approximately to percent of these professional and subcontracted services were directly incurred on behalf of our clients and were reimbursed by them  with such reimbursements being included in revenue 
occupancy  communications and other expenses represent expenses for rent  utilities  supplies and telephone to operate office locations as well as non client reimbursed travel by associates  publications and professional development 
this line item also includes miscellaneous expenses  including gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 

table of contents general and administrative expenses include the operational costs  professional fees and insurance premiums associated with corporate management  general counsel  marketing  human resources  finance  research and technology support 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the areas that we believe are critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients  discretionary compensation  income taxes  pension assumptions  incurred but not reported claims  and goodwill and intangible assets 
the critical accounting policies discussed below involves making difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate or assumption and different estimates that we could have used or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur may have a material impact on our financial statements and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue includes fees primarily generated from consulting services provided 
we recognize revenue from these consulting engagements when hours are worked  either on a time and materials basis or on a fixed fee basis  depending on the terms and conditions defined at the inception of an engagement with a client 
the terms of our contracts with clients are fixed and determinable and may change based upon agreement by both parties 
individual consultants billing rates are principally based on a multiple of salary and compensation costs 
revenue for fixed fee arrangements  which span multiple months  is based upon the percentage of completion method 
the company typically has three types of fixed fee arrangements annual recurring projects  projects of a short duration  and non recurring system projects 
annual recurring projects and the projects of short duration are typically straightforward and highly predictable in nature 
as a result  the project manager and financial staff are able to identify  as the project status is reviewed and bills are prepared monthly  the occasions when cost overruns could lead to the recording of a loss accrual 
our system projects are typically found in our technology and administration solutions group 
they tend to be more complex projects that are longer in duration and subject to more changes in scope as the project progresses than projects undertaken in other segments 
we evaluate at least quarterly  and more often as needed  project managers estimates to complete to assure that the projects current status is accounted for properly 
our technology and administration solutions group contracts generally provide that if the client terminates a contract  the company is entitled to payment for services performed through termination 

table of contents revenue recognition for fixed fee engagements is affected by a number of factors that change the estimated amount of work required to complete the project such as changes in scope  the staffing on the engagement and or the level of client participation 
the periodic engagement evaluations require us to make judgments and estimates regarding the overall profitability and stage of project completion that  in turn  affect how we recognize revenue 
the company recognizes a loss on an engagement when estimated revenue to be received for that engagement is less than the total estimated direct and indirect costs associated with the engagement 
losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
the company has experienced certain costs in excess of estimates from time to time 
management believes that it is rare  however  for these excess costs to result in overall project losses 
the company has developed various software programs and technologies that we provide to clients in connection with consulting services 
in most instances  such software is hosted and maintained by the company and ownership of the technology and rights to the related code remain with the company 
software developed to be utilized in providing services to a client  but for which the client does not have the contractual right to take possession  is capitalized in accordance with the aicpa s statement of position accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
revenue associated with the related contract  together with amortization of the related capitalized software  is recognized over the service period 
as a result we do not recognize revenue during the implementation phase of an engagement 
revenue recognized in excess of billings is recorded as unbilled accounts receivable 
cash collections and invoices generated in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met 
client reimbursable expenses  including those relating to travel  other out of pocket expenses and any third party costs  are included in revenue  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses are included in professional and subcontracted services as a cost of revenue 
valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from our clients failure to pay for our services after the services have been rendered  including allowances when customer disputes may exist 
the related provision is generally recorded as a reduction to revenue 
our allowance policy is based on the aging of our billed and unbilled client receivables and has been developed based on our write off history 
facts and circumstances such as the average length of time the receivables are past due  general market conditions  current economic trends and our clients ability to pay may cause fluctuations in our valuation of billed and unbilled receivables 
discretionary compensation the company s compensation program includes a discretionary annual bonus that is determined by management and paid once per fiscal year in the form of cash and or deferred stock units after the company s annual operating results are finalized 
an estimated annual bonus amount is initially developed at the beginning of each fiscal year in conjunction with our budgeting process 
quarterly  estimated annual operating performance is reviewed by the company and the discretionary annual bonus amount is then adjusted  if necessary  by management to reflect changes in the forecast of pre bonus profitability for the year 
in those quarters where the estimated annual bonus level changes  the remaining estimated annual bonus is accrued over the remaining quarters as a constant percentage of estimated future net income 
annual bonus levels may vary from current expectations as a result of changes in the company s forecast of net income and competitive employment market conditions 

table of contents income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which prescribes the use of the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax asset or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a given deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in accordance with sfas no 
 income tax expense includes i deferred tax expense  which generally represents the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability balance during the year plus any change in valuation allowances and ii current tax expense  which represents the amount of tax currently payable to or receivable from a taxing authority plus amounts accrued for expected tax contingencies including both tax and interest 
reserves for income tax related uncertainties are based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
these reserves are established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of tax audits 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 
accruals for tax contingencies are provided for in accordance with the requirements of fin pension assumptions we sponsor both qualified and non qualified  non contributory defined benefit pension plans in north america and the uk that cover approximately of our liability 
under our plans in north america  benefits are based on the number of years of service and the associate s compensation during the five highest paid consecutive years of service 
beginning january  we have made changes to our plan in the uk related to years of service used in calculating benefits for associates 
benefits earned prior to january are based on the number of years of service and the associate s compensation during the three years before leaving the plan and benefits earned after january are based on the number of years of service and the associate s average compensation during the associate s term of service since that date 
the non qualified plan  included only in north america  provides for pension benefits that would be covered under the qualified plan but are limited by the internal revenue code 
the non qualified plan has no assets and therefore is an unfunded arrangement 
the benefit liability is reflected on the balance sheet 
the measurement date for each of the plans is june determination of our obligations and annual expense under the plans is based on a number of assumptions that  given the longevity of the plans  are long term in focus 
a change in one or a combination of these assumptions could have a material impact on our pension benefit obligation and related expense 
for this reason  management employs a long term view so that assumptions do not change frequently in response to short term volatility in the economy 
any difference between actual and assumed results is amortized into our pension expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees 
we consider several factors prior to the start of each fiscal year when determining the appropriate annual assumptions  including economic forecasts  relevant benchmarks  historical trends  portfolio composition and peer comparisons 

table of contents north america the following assumptions were used at the end of the past three fiscal years in the valuation of our north american plans year ended june discount rate expected long term rate of return on assets rate of increase in compensation levels the percent discount rate assumption used at the end of fiscal year represents a basis point increase from the percent discount rate used at the end of fiscal year and fiscal year the company s discount rate assumptions were determined by matching future pension benefit payments with expected future us aa corporate bond yields for the same periods 
the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption remained at percent per annum  unchanged from fiscal years and selection of the return assumption at percent per annum was supported by an analysis performed by the company of the weighted average yield expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments 
the investment makeup is heavily weighted towards equities 
the actual return on assets for fiscal year was a loss of percent  compared to a return of percent for fiscal year the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the us pension plans change in assumption effect on fy pre tax pension expense basis point decrease in discount rate million basis point increase in discount rate million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million basis point increase in expected return on assets million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
it should be noted that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
the company s us other postretirement employee benefits plan is relatively insensitive to discount rate changes due to the plan provisions that have been established to control costs and as such no sensitivity results are shown in the table above 
united kingdom the following assumptions were used at the end of the past three fiscal years in the valuation of our uk plan year ended june discount rate expected long term rate of return on assets rate of increase in compensation levels 
table of contents the percent discount rate assumption used at the end of fiscal year represents a basis point increase over the rate used at june  and a basis point increase over the discount rate at june  the discount rate is set having regard to yields on european aa corporate bonds at the measurement date and this increase reflects the change in yields between these dates 
the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption increased to percent per annum for fiscal year from percent per annum for fiscal year the rate of return was supported by an analysis performed by the company of the weighted average return expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments which is heavily weighted towards bonds 
the actual return on assets through fiscal year was a loss of percent compared to a gain of percent for fiscal year the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the uk pension plans change in assumption effect on fy pre tax pension expense basis point decrease in discount rate million basis point increase in discount rate million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million basis point increase in expected return on assets million the differences in the discount rate and compensation level assumption used for the north american and uk plans above can be attributed to the differing interest rate environments associated with the currencies and economies to which the plans are subject 
the differences in the expected return on assets are primarily driven by the respective asset allocation in each plan  coupled with the return expectations for assets in the respective currencies 
the north american plans are approximately percent invested in equities  which on average provide a higher return than bonds  which is the predominant investment for the uk plans 
incurred but not reported claims the company uses actuarial assumptions to estimate and record a liability for incurred but not reported ibnr professional liability claims 
our estimated ibnr liability is based on long term trends and averages  and reflects consideration of a number of factors  including changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  and legislation and economic decisions  but excludes the effect of claims data for large cases due to the insufficiency of actual experience with such cases 
management does not currently expect significant fluctuations in the ibnr liability  based on the company s historical claims experience 
however  our estimated ibnr liability will fluctuate if claims experience changes over time 
goodwill and intangible assets in applying the purchase method of accounting for our business combinations  amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired have been based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisitions  with the remainder recorded as goodwill 
intangible assets are initially valued at fair market value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the net assets for that reporting unit 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon a multiple of revenue for the reporting unit 
this revenue multiple is based on our experience and knowledge of our own and other transactions in the marketplace 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise 

table of contents the evaluation of impairment would be based upon a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset would be considered impaired 
the impairment expense would be determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value  with any shortfall from fair value recognized as an expense in the current period

credit agreement the company has a credit facility provided by a syndicate of banks in an aggregate principal amount of million 
interest rates associated with this facility vary with libor and or the prime rate and are based on our leverage ratio  as defined by the credit agreement

the company had no borrowings under the credit facility as of june  compared to million of borrowings outstanding under the facility at june  credit under the facility is available upon demand  although the credit facility requires us to observe certain covenants including a cash flow leverage ratio and a fixed coverage charge ratio and is collateralized with a pledge of stock of material subsidiaries 
we were in compliance with both covenants under the credit facility as of june  this facility is scheduled to mature on june  
table of contents a portion of the revolving facility is used to support required letters of credit issued under the credit line 
as a result  million of the facility was unavailable for operating needs as of june  we are charged a fee for outstanding letters of credit that also fluctuates based on our leverage ratio 
the company has also provided a million australian dollar denominated letter of credit us million to an australian governmental agency as required by the local regulations 
the estimated fair market value of these letters of credit is immaterial because they have never been used  and the company believes that future usage is remote 
risk management as a part of our overall risk management program  we carry customary commercial insurance policies  including commercial general liability and claims made professional liability insurance with a self insured retention of million per claim  which provides coverage for professional liability claims of the company and its subsidiaries  including the cost of defending such claims 
our professional liability insurance coverage beyond our self insured retention amount is written by an affiliated captive insurance company pcic owned by us and two other professional services firms  and by various commercial insurance carriers 
in formulating its premium structure  pcic estimates the amount it expects to pay for losses and loss expenses for all the members as a whole and then allocates that amount to the member firms based on the individual member s expected losses 
pcic bases premium calculations  which are determined annually based on experience through march of each year  on relative risk of the various lines of business performed by each of the owner companies  past claim experience of each owner company  growth of each of those companies  industry risk profiles in general and the overall insurance markets 
as of july   the captive insurance company carries reinsurance for losses it insures above million 
since losses incurred by pcic below this level are not covered by reinsurance  but are direct expenses of pcic  reserve adjustments and actual outcomes of specific claims of any pcic member firm carry through into watson wyatt s financial results as income or loss from affiliates through our ownership of pcic 
thus from time to time the impacts of pcic s reserve development may result in fluctuations in watson wyatt s earnings 
our agreements with pcic could require additional payments to pcic in the event that the company decided to exit pcic and adverse claims significantly exceed prior expectations 
if these circumstances were to occur  the company would record a liability at the time it becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
the company will continue to provide for the self insured retention where specific estimated losses and loss expenses for known claims in excess of million are considered probable and reasonably estimable 
although the company maintains professional liability insurance coverage  this insurance does not cover claims made after expiration of our current insurance contracts 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a liability for incurred but not reported ibnr professional liability claims if they are probable and reasonably estimable  and for which we have not yet contracted for insurance coverage 
the company uses actuarial assumptions to estimate and record its ibnr liability and has a million ibnr liability recorded as of june  
table of contents insurance market conditions for our industry and the company include heightened overall premium cost 
in addition  in  pcic raised the reinsurance attachment point from million to million 
trends toward higher self insured retentions and constraints on aggregate excess coverage for this class of insurance coverage are anticipated to continue or to recur periodically  and to be reflected in our future annual insurance renewals 
as a result  we will continue to assess our ability to secure future insurance coverage and we cannot assure that such coverage will continue to be available indefinitely in the event of specific adverse claims experience  adverse loss trends  market capacity constraints or other factors 
in anticipation of the possibility of future reductions in risk transfer from pcic to re insurers  as well as the hardening insurance market conditions in recent years  the firms that own pcic  including the company  have increased pcic s capital in the past and we will continue to re assess capital requirements on a regular basis 
in light of increasing worldwide litigation  including litigation against professionals  the company has a policy that all client relationships be documented by engagement letters containing specific risk mitigation clauses that were not included in all historical client agreements 
certain contractual provisions designed to mitigate risk may not be legally practical or enforceable in litigation involving breaches of fiduciary duty or certain other alleged errors or omissions  or in certain jurisdictions 
we may incur significant legal expenses in defending against litigation 
nearly percent of the company s us and us corporate clients have signed engagement letters including some if not all of our preferred mitigation clauses  and initiatives to maintain that process in the united states and the united kingdom and complete it elsewhere are underway

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business 
these risks include interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange and translation risk 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio in mainly short term securities that are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 

table of contents foreign currency risk international revenues result from transactions by our foreign operations and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these operations also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  our foreign operations use the local currency  as their functional currency 
our primary international operations use the british pound  the euro and the canadian dollar 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
translation exposure foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated financial position as well as our consolidated results of operations and may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our condensed consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statement of income 
we consolidate our international subsidiaries by converting them into us dollars in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 foreign currency translation fas 
the results of operations and our financial position will fluctuate when there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates
