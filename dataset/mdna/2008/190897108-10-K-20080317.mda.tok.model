item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the company is a financial holding company that offers a broad array of financial service products to its target market of professionals  small and medium sized businesses  and high net worth individuals 
our operating segments include commercial banking  investment banking  investment advisory and trust  and insurance 
earnings are derived primarily from our net interest income  which is interest income less interest expense  and our noninterest income earned from fee based business lines and banking service fees  offset by noninterest expense 
as the majority of our assets are interest earning and our liabilities are interest bearing  changes in interest rates impact our net interest margin  the largest component of our operating revenue which is defined as net interest income plus noninterest income 
we manage our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on our operating results 
we also have focused on reducing our dependency on our net interest margin by increasing our noninterest income 
our company has focused on developing an organization with personnel  management systems and products that will allow us to compete effectively and position us for growth 
the cost of this process relative to our size has been high 
in addition  we have operated with excess capacity during the start up phases of various projects 
as a result  relatively high levels of noninterest expense have adversely affected our earnings over the past several years 
salaries and employee benefits comprised most of this overhead category 
however  we believe that our compensation levels have allowed us to recruit and retain a highly qualified management team capable of implementing our business strategies 
we believe our compensation policies  which include the granting of options to purchase common stock to many employees and the offering of an employee stock purchase plan  have highly motivated our employees and enhanced our ability to maintain customer loyalty and generate earnings 
for additional discussion on options granted to employees  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
industry overview 
the us commercial banking industry was significantly impacted in by increased concerns about the credit quality of mortgages and investment securities collateralized by real estate 
as the housing market deteriorated during  losses on subprime mortgages increased and the subprime mortgage market was essentially shutdown 
the combination of the real estate downturn and subprime losses led to an overall tightening in the credit market 
the senior loan officer opinion survey on bank lending practices conducted by the federal reserve board found that one third of domestic banks had tightened their lending standards on commercial and industrial c i loans during the fourth quarter of in addition  of domestic banks had tightened their lending standards on commercial real estate loans during the fourth quarter 
during this period  loan loss provisions at fdic insured institutions reached a year high and quarterly earnings for the industry fell below billion for the first time since the overall market conditions led the federal open markets committee fomc to reduce the target federal funds rate by basis points in the last four months of  the first decrease since the fomc continued this strategy in january  when the target federal funds rate was decreased by basis points within a one week period 
while the company does not originate or purchase subprime loans  nearly all financial service organizations have been impacted by the current environment 
company overview 
from december   the first complete fiscal year under the current management team  to december   our organization has grown from a bank holding company with two bank locations and total assets of million to a diversified financial services holding company with bank locations  six fee based businesses and total assets of billion 
certain key metrics of our operating segments at december  and are as follows investment corporate commercial investment advisory support and banking banking trust insurance other consolidated in thousands  except per share data net income loss diluted earnings loss per share total assets net income loss diluted earnings loss per share total assets noted below are some of the significant financial performance measures and operational accomplishments for our commercial banking franchise had strong growth in both net income and earnings per share during as compared to our loan portfolio  the largest interest earning asset base of the company  increased in the increase was driven primarily by our colorado operations which grew loans by million  or  over our arizona operations also had strong loan growth of million  or  over the provision for loan losses increased to million in from million in  a million increase 
net charge offs during increased to million compared to net recoveries of million in  a million increase 
effective january  the fdic changed its risk based assessment matrix and the assessment rates charged to financial institutions 
prior to the change the bank was not assessed a rate based on the bank s risk category 
under the new assessment matrix the bank will be assessed a rate between to basis points  which is the lowest rate under the new framework 
this has increased the company s regulatory assessment costs in and will continue to impact future periods 
in april  the bank converted from a national bank to a state bank 
the change in charter is expected to reduce the dollar amount of certain regulatory assessments and will help offset the increase in the fdic assessment rates 
in august  the bank announced the formation of a real estate capital markets group 
the group will develop a comprehensive capital markets product offering and platform for the bank s real estate customers  to include mezzanine debt and other financings  and will also establish a loan syndications desk enabling the bank to expand into larger loan transactions and more effectively and efficiently manage its capital base 
investment banking contributed per diluted share in  down from in investment banking revenues are transactional in nature and  as a result  the segment s earnings can be more volatile 
while not a significant source of the company s earnings  the segment has been a positive contributor over the last several years 
investment advisory and trust  while a less significant part of our overall operations  continues to recognize increases in revenue production and growth in assets under management 
during  the company was successful in recruiting an experienced management team from a local competitor to lead the company s trust function 
while the short term impact of the recruitment has caused the segment s operational results to decrease  the long term prospects of the segment has been enhanced 
in addition  on december   the company acquired wagner  an investment advisor providing investment management services for high net worth individuals and families  foundations and non profit organizations to complement the segment 
the insurance segment had a large decrease in net income and earnings per share during  primarily due to a decrease in the wealth transfer business 
the wealth transfer business is transactional by nature and fluctuates based on the number of life insurance policies closed during a year 
during  the segment had a higher than normal number of cases that were rejected in underwriting due to unforeseen medical issues 
to a lesser extent  the segment was also impacted by the overall reduction in insurance premiums being realized throughout the commercial insurance industry 
corporate support and other had an increase in its net loss and loss per share  primarily due to an increase in interest rates that increased our interest expense on our variable rate junior subordinated debentures and an increase in salaries and employee benefits 
in addition  the segment entered into a new revolving line of credit during that increased interest expense over during the fourth quarter of  the company began the process of selling additional common stock through a secondary offering that subsequently closed on january  the company sold  shares of common stock at a public offering price of 
our corporate name was changed to cobiz financial inc at our annual meeting in may and the new brand has been introduced to each of our subsidiaries 
while the cost of the branding effort increased operating expense in  the unified presentation of our business will create synergies and cross sell opportunities that will far outweigh any short term costs 
on july   our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to of our outstanding stock 
the program concluded on november   when all authorized shares had been repurchased 
the shares were repurchased at a weighted average price of and a total cost of million 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k beginning on page f for a discussion of the segments included in our principal activities and for certain financial information for each segment  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
bank 
the commercial bank segment  the cornerstone of our franchise  had continued success in growing the balance sheet and earnings 
loans grew by  deposit and customer repurchase agreements grew by  and earnings grew by 
the growth of the bank was encouraging considering was a challenging year for the bank and the industry as we faced increased competition and narrowing spreads between our interest bearing assets and our cost of funds 
while loan demand continued to grow in the double digits  lower cost deposit accounts excluding time deposits and customer repurchase agreements has slowed to single digit growth for the past two years  resulting in a loan to deposit ratio that exceeded at december  as loan growth outpaced deposit growth  our mix of funding shifted to a higher level of wholesale funds that are at a higher interest rate than core deposits 
asset quality remained exceptional with nonperforming loans to total loans at only basis points at the end of fee based business lines 
the company s fee based business lines investment banking  insurance  and investment advisory and trust operated at a slight loss for on a combined basis 
however  before parent company management fees  central service allocations and amortization  all the fee based companies generated positive cash flow 
our ratio of noninterest income to total operating revenues was for compared to in this is in line with the company s ongoing target of 
we believe that through the combination of our commercial banking franchise and our fee based businesses  we are uniquely situated to service our commercial clients throughout their business lifecycle 
we are able to help our customers grow by providing banking services from our bank franchise  capital planning from gmb  and employee and executive benefits packages from fdl 
we can assist in planning for the future with wealth transfer and business succession planning from fdl 
we are able to protect assets with p c insurance from cobiz insurance 
we can facilitate exit and retirement strategies with merger and acquisition services from gmb  and investment management services with acmg and wagner 
we are also able to preserve our customers wealth with trust and fiduciary services from cobiz trust  investment management services from acmg and wagner  and wealth transfer services from fdl 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its consolidated financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
in making those critical accounting estimates  we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate 
different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the assumptions that could occur  could have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based upon management s periodic review of the collectibilty of loans in light of historical experience  the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
we maintain a loan review program independent of the lending function that is designed to reduce and control risk in the lending function 
it includes the monitoring of lending activities with respect to underwriting and processing new loans  preventing insider abuse  and timely follow up and corrective action for loans showing signs of deterioration in quality 
we also have a systematic process to evaluate individual loans and pools of loans within our loan portfolio 
we maintain a loan grading system whereby each loan is assigned a grade between and  with representing the highest quality credit  representing a non accrual loan where collection or liquidation in full is highly questionable and improbable  and representing a loss that has been or will be charged off 
grades are assigned based upon the degree of risk associated with repayment of a loan in the normal course of business pursuant to the original terms 
loans above a certain dollar amount that are adversely graded are reported to the loan committee and the chief credit officer along with current financial information  a collateral analysis and an action plan 
individual loans that are deemed to be impaired are evaluated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
in determining the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  we analyze the various components of the loan portfolio  including all significant credits  on an individual basis 
when analyzing the adequacy  we segment the loan portfolio into components with similar characteristics  such as risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
possible factors that may impact the allowance for loan losses include  but are not limited to changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards as well as collection  charge off and recovery practices  changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments  including the condition of various market segments  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due and classified loans  and trends in the volume of non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings  and other loan modifications  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations  and the effect of external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio 
refer to the provision and allowance for loan losses section under results of operations below for further discussion on management s methodology 
recoverability of goodwill sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that we evaluate on an annual basis or whenever events occur which may indicate possible impairment whether any portion of our recorded goodwill is impaired 
the recoverability of goodwill is a critical accounting policy that requires subjective estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is not considered impaired 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount  goodwill is considered impaired 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using market multiples of comparable entities  including recent transactions  or a combination of market multiples and a discounted cash flow methodology 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires a high degree of subjective management assumption 
discounted cash flow valuation models are utilized that incorporate such variables as revenue growth rates  expense trends  discount rates and terminal values 
based upon an evaluation of key data and market factors  management selects from a range the specific variables to be incorporated into the valuation model 
we conducted our annual evaluation of our reporting units as of december  as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  for the period ending december  the estimated fair value of all reporting units exceeded their carrying values and goodwill impairment was not deemed to exist 
the fair value calculations were also tested for sensitivity to reflect reasonable variations  including keeping all other variables constant and reducing projected revenue growth and projected cost savings 
using this sensitivity approach  there was no impairment identified in any reporting unit 
however  during  the volume of high end wealth transfer cases completed during the year decreased from prior years  leading to an overall reduction in operating revenue and cash flow for the insurance unit 
as such  revenues were less than the projected target 
although we fully expect wealth transfer activity to increase to a normal level in  if the unit continues to recognize operational losses and or a significant decrease in revenue and cash flows  evaluation of the fair value could result in the determination that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value and that goodwill relating to the unit has been impaired 
if we were to conclude that goodwill has been impaired  that conclusion could result in a non cash goodwill impairment charge  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
share based payments on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective method 
under this method  compensation cost is recognized for all awards granted after the required effective date and to awards modified  cancelled or repurchased after that date and the portion of prior awards for which the requisite service has not yet been rendered  based on the grant date fair value of those awards calculated for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we applied the intrinsic value method for our stock based compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb accounting for stock issued to employees  which was allowed by sfas as an alternative to the fair value method recommended by sfas sfas r requires that the cash retained as a result of the tax deductibility of employee share based awards be presented as a component of cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
in prior periods  this amount was reported as a component of cash flows from operating activities 
under sfas r  we use the black scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of our stock options as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the black scholes fair value model includes various assumptions  including the expected volatility  expected life and expected dividend rate of the options 
in addition  the company is required to estimate the amount of options issued that are expected to be forfeited 
these assumptions reflect our best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  stock based compensation expense  as calculated and recorded under sfas r  could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if we use different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods 
we also have other policies that we consider to be significant accounting policies  however  these policies  which are disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  do not meet the definition of critical accounting policies because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
recent accounting pronouncements on december   the company adopted securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
topic n  financial statements considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
prior to sab  companies would evaluate the materiality of financial statement misstatements using either the current year income statement rollover or balance sheet approach iron curtain  with the rollover approach focusing on new misstatements added in the current year  and the iron curtain approach focusing on the cumulative amount of misstatement present in a company s balance sheet 
misstatements that would be material under one approach could be viewed as immaterial under another approach  and not be corrected 
under sab a registrant s financial statements require adjustment when either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that is material  after considering all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors 
registrants are not required to restate prior period financial statements when initially applying sab if management properly applied its previous approach ie rollover or iron curtain given that all relevant qualitative factors were considered 
sab states that  upon initial application  registrants may elect to a restate prior periods  or b record the cumulative effect of the initial application of sab in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities  with the offsetting adjustment made to retained earnings 
to the extent that registrants elect to record the cumulative effect of initially applying sab  disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected in the cumulative adjustment is required 
the disclosure must include when and how each error being corrected arose and the fact that the errors had previously been considered immaterial

 business combinations revised sfas r 
sfas r is relevant to all transactions or events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses 
sfas r requires an acquirer to recognize any assets and non controlling interest acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at fair value as of the acquisition date 
liabilities related to contingent consideration are recognized and measured at fair value on the date of acquisition rather than at a later date when the amount of the consideration may be resolved beyond a reasonable doubt 
this revised approach replaces sfas s cost allocation process in which the cost of an acquisition was allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair value 
sfas r requires any acquisition related costs and restructuring costs to be expensed as incurred as opposed to allocating such costs to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as previously required by sfas under sfas r  an acquirer recognizes liabilities for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting only if the requirements of sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  are met 
sfas r allows for the recognition of pre acquisition contingencies at fair value only if these contingencies are likely to materialize 
if this criterion is not met at the acquisition date  then the acquirer accounts for the non contractual contingency in accordance with recognition criteria set forth under sfas  accounting for contingencies  in which case nothing should be recognized in purchase accounting

commercial loans 
commercial lending consists of loans to small and medium sized businesses in a wide variety of industries 
the bank s areas of emphasis in commercial lending include  but are not limited to  loans to wholesalers  manufacturers  construction and business services companies 
we provide a broad range of commercial loans  including lines of credit for working capital purposes and term loans for the acquisition of equipment and other purposes 
commercial loans are generally collateralized by inventory  accounts receivable  equipment  real estate and other commercial assets  and may be supported by other credit enhancements such as personal guarantees 
however  where warranted by the overall financial condition of the borrower  loans may be unsecured and based on the cash flow of the business 
terms of commercial loans generally range from one to five years  and the majority of such loans have floating interest rates

we also originate residential mortgage loans on a limited basis as an accommodation to our preferred customers 
the primary risks of real estate mortgage loans include the borrower s inability to pay  material decreases in the value of the real estate that is being held as collateral and significant increases in interest rates  which may make the real estate mortgage loan unprofitable 
we do not actively seek residential mortgage loans for our own portfolio  but rather refer such loans to other financial institutions 
however  for those residential mortgage loans that are extended  we attempt to apply conservative loan to value ratios and obtain personal guarantees and generally require a strong history of debt servicing capability and fully amortized terms of years or less 
in august  we formed a real estate capital markets group 
the group will develop a comprehensive capital markets product offering and platform for the bank s real estate customers  to include mezzanine debt and other financings  and will also establish a loan syndications desk enabling the bank to expand into larger loan transactions and more effectively and efficiently manage its capital base

moreover  we generally monitor construction draws monthly and inspect property to ensure that construction is progressing as projected 
our underwriting standards generally require that the principal amount of a speculative loan be no more than of the appraised value of the completed construction project or of pre sold projects

in order to improve customer service  continuity and customer retention  the same loan officer often services the banking relationships of both the business and business owners or management 
nonperforming assets our nonperforming assets consist of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  past due loans more than days and other real estate owned 
nonaccrual loans are those loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
impaired loans are defined as loans for which  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement all of which were on a non accrual basis 
the following table sets forth information with respect to these assets at the dates indicated 
at december  in thousands nonperforming loans loans days or more delinquent and still accruing interest nonaccrual loans restructured loans and leases total nonperforming loans repossessed assets total nonperforming assets allowance for loan losses allowance for credit losses allowance for loan and credit losses ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans ratio of allowance for loan and credit losses to total loans ratio of allowance for loan and credit losses to nonperforming loans accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management believes  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  the borrower s financial condition is such that the collection of interest is doubtful 
a delinquent loan is generally placed on nonaccrual status when it becomes days past due 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all accrued and unpaid interest on the loan is reversed and deducted from earnings as a reduction of reported interest income 
no additional interest is accrued on the loan balance until the collection of both principal and interest becomes reasonably certain 
when the issues relating to a nonaccrual loan are finally resolved  there may ultimately be an actual write down or charge off of the principal balance of the loan  which may necessitate additional charges to earnings 
restructured loans are those for which concessions  including the reduction of interest rates below a rate otherwise available to the borrower  or the deferral of interest or principal  have been granted due to the borrower s weakened financial condition 
interest on restructured loans is accrued at the restructured rates when it is anticipated that no loss of original principal will occur 
the additional interest income that would have been recognized for the years ended december    and  if our nonaccrual and restructured loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  and the interest income on nonaccrual and restructured loans actually included in our net income for such periods  was not material 
repossessed assets include vehicles and other commercial assets acquired under agreements with delinquent borrowers and are carried at the lesser of fair market value less anticipated selling costs or the balance of the related loan 
in addition to the nonperforming assets described above  at december   we had loan relationships considered by management to be potential problem loans  with outstanding principal totaling approximately million 
a potential problem loan is one as to which management has concerns about the borrower s future performance under the terms of the loan contract 
for our protection  management monitors these loans closely 
these loans are current as to the principal and interest and  accordingly  are not included in the nonperforming asset categories 
however  further deterioration may result in the loan being classified as nonperforming 
the level of potential problem loans is factored into the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
analysis of allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s recognition of the risks of extending credit and its evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio 
the allowance is maintained to provide for probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans and for losses inherent in the loan portfolio that have been incurred at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is based on various factors affecting the loan portfolio  including a review of problem loans  business conditions  historical loss experience  evaluation of the quality of the underlying collateral  and holding and disposal costs 
the allowance is increased by additional charges to operating income and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the allowance for credit losses represents management s recognition of a separate reserve for off balance sheet loan commitments and letters of credit 
while the allowance for loan losses is recorded as a contra asset to the loan portfolio on the consolidated balance sheet  the allowance for credit losses is recorded in accrued interest and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
although the allowances are presented separately on the balance sheet  any losses incurred from credit losses would be reported as a charge off in the allowance for loan losses  since any loss would be recorded after the off balance sheet commitment had been funded 
due to the relationship of these allowances  as extensions of credit underwritten through a comprehensive risk analysis  information on both the allowance for loan and credit losses positions is presented in the following table 
for the year ended december  in thousands balance of allowance for loan losses at beginning of period charge offs commercial real estate mortgage consumer other total charge offs recoveries commercial real estate mortgage consumer other total recoveries net charge offs recoveries provision for loan losses charged to operations balance of allowance for loan losses at end of period balance of allowance for credit losses at beginning of period provision for credit losses charged to operations balance of allowance for credit losses at end of period total provision for loan and credit losses charged to operations ratio of net charge offs recoveries to average loans average loans outstanding during the period additions to the allowances for loan and credit losses  which are charged as expenses on our income statement  are made periodically to maintain the allowances at the appropriate level  based on our analysis of the potential risk in the loan and commitment portfolios 
loans charged off  net of amounts recovered from such loans  reduce the allowance for loan losses 
the amount of the allowance is a function of the levels of loans outstanding  the level of nonperforming loans  historical loan loss experience  the amount of loan losses actually charged against the reserve during a given period and current economic conditions 
federal regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  review our loans and allowance for loan and credit losses 
we believe that our allowance for loan and credit losses is adequate to cover anticipated loan and credit losses 
however  management may determine a need to increase the allowances for loan and credit losses  or regulators  when reviewing the bank s loan and commitment portfolio in the future  may request the bank increase such allowances 
either of these events could adversely affect our earnings 
further  there can be no assurance that our actual loan and credit losses will not exceed the allowances for loan and credit losses 
the allowance for loan losses consists of three elements i specific reserves determined in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan sfas  based on probable losses on specific loans  ii general reserves determined in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies based on historical loan loss experience adjusted for other qualitative risk factors both internal and external to the company  and iii unallocated reserves 
specific reserves 
the company continuously evaluates its reserve for loan losses to maintain an adequate level to absorb loan losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
reserves on loans identified as impaired are based on discounted expected cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate  the observable market value of the loan or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
loans are considered to be impaired in accordance with the provisions of sfas  when it is probable that all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms will not be collected 
factors contributing to the determination of specific reserves include the financial condition of the borrower  changes in the value of pledged collateral and general economic conditions 
general reserves 
general reserves are considered part of the allocated portion of the allowance 
we use a comprehensive loan grading process for our loan portfolios 
based on this process  we assign a loss factor to each pool of graded loans 
we use a combination of our long term average loss experience and external loss data in determining the appropriate loss factor 
this estimate represents the potential unconfirmed losses within the portfolio 
the historical estimation for each loan pool is then adjusted to account for factors  which may cause future losses to deviate from historical levels 
factors considered by management that are likely to cause estimated credit losses associated with our current portfolio to differ from historical loss experience include changes in national and local economic and business conditions and developments  changes in lending policies and procedures  including underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  changes in the trend of the volume and severity of past due loans  and trends in the volume of non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings  and other loan modifications  changes in the quality of the bank s loan review system and the degree of oversight by the bank s board of directors  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations  the impact of competition on loan structuring and pricing  the impact of rising interest rates on portfolio risk  and the effect of external factors  such as legal and regulatory requirements  on the level of estimated credit losses in the bank s current portfolio 
the company has an internal loan review department that is independent of the lending function to challenge and corroborate the loan grading system  and provide additional analysis in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the allocated reserve for graded loans  a portion of the allowance is determined by segmenting the portfolio into product groupings with similar risk characteristics 
this supplemental portion of the allowance includes our judgmental consideration of any additional amounts necessary for subjective factors such as economic uncertainties and excess concentration risks 
concentration risk limits have been established for  among other things  certain industry concentrations  large balance and highly leveraged credit relationships that exceed specified risk grades  and loans originated with policy exceptions that exceed specified risk grades 
management evaluates the degree of risk that each one of these components has on the quality of the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis 
while management utilizes its best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the company s control  including the performance of our loan portfolio  the economy  changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications 
unallocated reserves 
the unallocated reserve  which is judgmentally determined  is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss when evaluating reserves for individual loans or pools of loans 
the methodology used in the periodic review of reserve adequacy  which is performed at least quarterly  is designed to be dynamic and responsive to changes in actual and expected credit losses 
these changes are reflected in both the general and unallocated reserves 
the historical loss ratios and estimated risk factors related to segmenting our loan portfolio  which are key considerations in this analysis  are updated quarterly and are weighted more heavily for recent economic conditions 
the review of reserve adequacy is performed by executive management and presented to the audit committee quarterly for its review and consideration 
the table below provides an allocation of the year end allowance for loan and credit losses by loan and commitment type  however  allocation of a portion of the allowance to one category of loans does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories at december  loans in loans in loans in loans in loans in category as a category as a category as a category as a category as a amount of of total amount of of total amount of of total amount of of total amount of of total in thousands allowance gross loans allowance gross loans allowance gross loans allowance gross loans allowance gross loans commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer other unallocated off balance sheet commitments total we believe that any allocation of the allowance into categories creates an appearance of precision that does not exist 
the allocation table should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts  by loan classification  to be charged to the allowance 
we believe that the table is a useful device for assessing the adequacy of the allowance as a whole 
the allowance is utilized as a single unallocated allowance available for all loans 
in  the company adopted a more refined segmentation system that resulted in a majority of the prior unallocated reserve being reallocated into the allowance for commercial loans 
part of the refinement in our segmentation involved assigning increased reserve factors to higher risk lending activities  such as leverage financings  certain loans lacking personal guarantees  land acquisition and development loans  or speculative real estate loans 
in addition  management modified reserve percentages to reflect the uncertainty of customers sensitive to increases in petroleum prices  a potential housing market slowdown  and rising interest rates 
overall during  economic conditions shifted and became less favorable affecting the company s credit quality measures 
the company recorded a provision for loan losses of million in versus million in the company had net charge offs for of million  or basis points of average loans 
this translated to an allowance for loan and credit losses equal to of total loans at december   down from at december  investments our investment portfolio is comprised primarily of securities rated aaa or better by various nationally recognized rating agencies  with the majority of the portfolio either maturing or repricing within a one to five year period 
our practice is to purchase primarily us treasury and us government agency backed securities 
our investment strategies are reviewed in monthly meetings of the asset liability management committee 
our mortgage backed securities are typically classified as available for sale 
our goals with respect to our securities portfolio are to maximize safety and soundness 
provide adequate liquidity 
maximize rate of return within the constraints of applicable liquidity requirements 
complement asset liability management strategies 
the following table sets forth the book value of the securities in our investment portfolio by type at the dates indicated 
at december  in thousands mortgage backed securities us government agencies trust preferred securities obligations of states and political subdivisions other investments total the company identified and subsequently sold approximately million and million in securities that were not in line with the current asset liability model during the fiscal years and  respectively 
the sale of million in securities resulted in a million loss on sale 
during  our net unrealized loss on the available for sale securities decreased million to million at december   from million at december  partially contributing to the decrease was million related to the realization of losses on securities sold and called during during  our net unrealized loss on the available for sale securities decreased million to million at december   from million at december  a decrease of million was due to the realization of certain losses on securities included in the aforementioned sale 
further decreases were due to a significant acceleration of paydown and amortization of our mortgage backed securities resulting from lower long term market rates relative to short term rates 
securities maturing during the year were replaced with high yield  short term agency investments and other mortgage backed securities market changes in interest rates can result in fluctuations in the market price of securities resulting in temporary unrealized losses 
these temporary losses in  and are primarily due to increases in interest rates related to our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
these securities are all highly rated  investment grade securities primarily issued by government sponsored organizations 
the company has not invested in securities collateralized by subprime or alt a mortgages 
the fair value of these securities is expected to recover as the securities approach their stated maturity or repricing date 
the company does not believe that any of the unrealized losses are a result of the credit quality of the issuing organizations

other assets the following table sets forth the values of our other miscellaneous assets at the dates indicated 
at december  in thousands goodwill intangible assets  net bank owned life insurance premises and equipment  net accrued interest receivable deferred income taxes other total the increase in goodwill during of million is primarily attributed to the purchase price allocation from the wagner acquisition  which took place on december  the increase in goodwill during of million was related to additional purchase price consideration on fdl and acmg under the terms of earn out agreements 
bank owned life insurance boli increased million to million at december   from million at december  boli increased million to million at december   from million at december  the increase was attributed to new boli policies of million and million from the growth in the cash surrender value of the policies 
the increase related wholly to growth in the cash surrender value of the policies 
deposits our primary source of funds has historically been customer deposits 
we offer a variety of accounts for depositors  which are designed to attract both short and long term deposits 
these accounts include certificates of deposit  savings accounts  money market accounts  checking and negotiable order of withdrawal accounts  and individual retirement accounts 
during the third quarter of  the company introduced a non collateralized eurodollar sweep product as an alternative to the collateralized customer repurchase product 
introduction of the eurodollar sweep attracted million of deposits during at december   million or of our deposits were noninterest bearing deposits 
we believe we receive a large amount of noninterest bearing deposits because we provide customers with the option of paying for treasury management services in cash or by maintaining additional noninterest bearing account balances 
interest bearing accounts earn interest at rates based on competitive market factors and our desire to increase or decrease certain types of maturities or deposits 
the company had million and million in brokered deposits at december  and  respectively 
brokered deposits are considered a wholesale financing source and are used as an alternative to other short term borrowings

the increase in over was primarily due to an increase in net interest income of million after provision for loan losses  a million increase in noninterest income  offset by a million increase in noninterest expense and a corresponding increase of million in the provision for taxes

net interest income 
the largest component of our net income is our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loans and investment securities  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  net interest spread and net interest margin 
volume refers to the average dollar levels of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
net interest spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the fomc uses the target federal funds rate  which is the interest rate used by banks lending to each other  to influence interest rates and the economy 
changes in the federal funds rate have a direct correlation to changes in the prime rate  the underlying index for most of the variable rate loans issued by the company 
the prime rate was at the beginning of  but with the economy expanding  the fomc raised the fed funds rate eight times during the year resulting in a corresponding increase in prime to at the end of the fomc continued its rate increases for the first half of resulting in four additional basis point increases in the prime rate bringing the rate to for the remainder of and into the third quarter of concern in the credit markets over escalating loss provisions  subprime mortgage defaults and structured investment write downs prompted the fomc to decrease rates by basis points during the latter part of  ending the year with the prime rate at

loan fees included in interest income are not material 
nonaccrual loans are included in average loans outstanding 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or over the prior year 
the net interest margin increased by basis points from the prior year to 
average interest earning assets increased by million or from the prior year 
the increase was largely related to average loan growth of million  offset by a decrease in the average investment portfolio of million 
the yield on interest earning assets increased by basis points  primarily contributed by loan volume growth of basis points  offset by a decrease of basis points in the investments portfolio 
introduction of the eurodollar deposit product in allowed the company to reduce its investment portfolio as securities matured or were called 
contributions to net interest margin relating to rate changes in the investment portfolio nearly offset the effects of the reduced volume 
average interest earning liabilities also increased during by million or from the prior year 
the increase was largely related to deposit growth of million  offset by a decrease in short term borrowing and securities sold under agreement to repurchase of million 
the impact of these changes in interest earning liabilities on net interest margin was a decrease of basis points  a change primarily relating to a basis point increase in the cost of deposits offset by a decrease of basis points relating to other borrowings and securities sold under agreement to repurchase 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  from million at december  the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in loans and a basis point increase in the average yield on interest earning assets  partially offset by a basis point increase in the average yield on interest bearing liabilities 
growth in the loan portfolio exceeded core deposit growth in resulting in increased usage of wholesale funds  primarily brokered cds  at a higher cost of funds 
the increase in the yield on interest bearing liabilities exceeded the increase on the yield of interest earning assets  resulting in a net decrease to net interest income due to interest rates 
customer sensitivity to deposit pricing and a competitive market for commercial lending combined to constrain growth in net interest income to the lowest level  in terms of percentage growth  in the past five years 
in order to reduce our asset sensitivity  the company executes an asset liability strategy using interest rate swaps to fix the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate loans indexed to prime 
during the company entered into five interest rate swaps with a total notional value of million  amortizing over three years 
no new swaps were created in and swaps were entered into prior to with a total notional value of million  typically amortizing over a four year period 
the company receives a fixed rate and pays a variable rate based on the notional amounts 
the company had million and million in notional values outstanding at december  and  respectively 
the weighted average interest rate paid was versus a weighted average rate received of at december   the rates paid and received at december   were and  respectively 
during and  the company recognized a basis point decrease and a basis point decrease in its net interest margin  respectively  due to the interest rate swaps 
provision and allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses increased by million to million for the year ended december  during  the provision for loan losses decreased to million  down from million in the increase in was made in recognition of the recent migration of loans into higher risk classifications  particularly credits in the arizona real estate portfolio 
overall credit quality associated with our loan portfolio remains very favorable with just million in nonperforming assets or of total assets at december   up from an exceptionally low reported for net charge offs increased during to million  relating to two commercial credits in the arizona market 
the increase reverses a five year trend of decreasing net charge offs through nonperforming assets have consistently been below industry and peer averages  and management believes the allowance  currently exceeding of nonperforming loans  is at a sufficient level to absorb potential losses in the portfolio 
at december   the allowance for loan and credit losses amounted to million  or of total loans compared to of total loans in  and in noninterest income 
the following table presents noninterest income for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands noninterest income service charges other loan fees investment advisory and trust income insurance income investment banking income other income total noninterest income service charges 
deposit service charges primarily consist of fees earned from our treasury management services 
customers are given the option to pay for these services in cash or by offsetting the fees for these services against an earnings credit that is given for maintaining noninterest bearing deposits 
fees earned from treasury management services will fluctuate based on the number of customers using the services and from changes in us treasury rates which are used as a benchmark for the earnings credit rate 
other miscellaneous deposit charges are transactional by nature and may not be consistent period over period 
the increase in over was due to higher customer utilization of our treasury management services 
service charges in were relatively stable with investment advisory and trust income 
investment advisory and trust income for increased million  or  to million 
trust and advisory income for increased million  or  to million  compared to the results are from the acmg and cobiz trust units and do not include any income related to wagner which was acquired on december  acmg s revenues  which account for approximately of the segment revenues  are dependent upon the market value of their assets under management 
acmg s income has increased each year since we acquired them in as a result of generally increasing market values over that term as well as new account growth 
an increase in the market value of assets under management  due to both market increases and the number of clients represented by our investment management group  has contributed to the increase in trust and advisory income each year 
market changes could have a negative impact on revenues if values trend significantly down 
discretionary assets under management  excluding wagner  increased to million at the end of  an increase of million since and an increase of million since discretionary assets under the management of wagner at december   were million which will begin producing revenues for the segment in insurance income 
insurance income for decreased by million  or  from million in the decrease in the period is largely attributable to a decline in revenues from the wealth management unit which saw a number of large cases fail to close during the year due to medical underwriting issues 
income from the segment was also negatively impacted by continued softening of p c premiums directly affecting commissions earned by cobiz insurance 
the decreases contrast with income growth reported for  increasing million  or  to million  compared to insurance income is derived from three main areas  wealth transfer  benefits consulting and p c 
the majority of fees earned on wealth transfer transactions are earned at the inception of the product offering in the form of commissions 
as the fees on these products are transactional by nature  fee income can fluctuate from period to period based on the number of transactions that have been closed 
revenue from benefits consulting and p c are more recurring revenue sources 
investment banking income 
investment banking income for grew slightly from  up million or 
income for increased million  or  to million  over investment banking income includes retainer fees which are recognized over the expected term of the engagement and success fees which are recognized when the transaction is completed and collectibility of fees is reasonably assured 
investment banking income is transactional by nature and will fluctuate based on the number of clients engaged and transactions successfully closed 
revenues from the unit have been reasonably stable since and the company believes it has a healthy pipeline of transactions to continue performing in other income 
other income for showed modest growth of million  or  from this compares to an increase of million  or  in over other income 
other income is comprised of increases in the cash surrender value of boli  earnings on equity method investments  merchant charges  bankcard fees  wire transfer fees  foreign exchange fees and safe deposit income 
the increase in other income for was largely due to earnings on equity method investments 
equity method investments are comprised of interests in mezzanine partnerships which contributed approximately million to income  an increase of million compared to the million increase in versus was primarily due to a million increase in earnings on the equity method investments and million in fees collected in conjunction with our customer hedge program 
earnings on our equity method investments are primarily impacted by the mezzanine funds sale of portfolio companies they own an interest in  which are not regular  recurring events 
fees collected on our customer hedge program are transactional  and produced exceptional results on the sale of interest rate swaps to our customers which was driven partly by the flat inverted yield curve making the product more attractive in that year than in when sales of the product dropped by approximately 
noninterest expense 
the following table presents noninterest expense for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands noninterest expense salaries and employee benefits excluding stock based compensation stock based compensation occupancy expenses  premises and equipment amortization of intangibles other operating expense loss on sale of other assets and securities total noninterest expense our efficiency ratio was for both and  a slight improvement from in the efficiency ratio is a measure of the company s overhead  measuring the percentage of each dollar of income that is paid in operating expenses 
our efficiency ratio has declined as we have begun to recognize the benefit of fixed cost projects put in place to facilitate the company s growth 
the company has identified a number of cost initiatives to be implemented  with the goal of reducing the efficiency ratio to approximately over the next few years 
salaries and employee benefits 
salaries and employee benefits for increased million  or  to million compared to salaries and employee benefits for increased million  or  to million compared to the increase in was primarily due to the addition of new bankers and annual merit increases 
during and the latter part of  the bank added a total of additional bankers in colorado and arizona at an incremental cost of million 
annual merit increases were effective on january  and averaged or million 
the company also had a million increase in incentive compensation during these increases were offset by a million decrease in compensation paid to commissionable employees  a million decrease in health medical costs and a net decrease of million in other salary and benefit expenses 
the decrease in compensation paid to commissionable employees is consistent with the decrease in revenue in our insurance segment 
the decrease in health medical costs during was due to a low level of claims experience that passes through to the company since we are partially self insured 
the increase in was due to higher staffing levels to accommodate the growth of the company and annual merit increases totaling million  a million increase in the variable compensation on our insurance and investment banking services segments to match the increase in their operating results and a million increase in medical insurance costs 
at december   the company employed full time equivalent employees  compared to in the company also saw an increase in medical costs when it began self insuring a portion of its medical insurance claims in mid although costs continue to increase  self insuring a portion of the medical insurance claims is a way to control the rising cost of insurance 
stock based compensation 
the company adopted sfas r on january   which requires us to recognize compensation costs for the grant date fair value of awards issued after the adoption date and for the portion of awards for which the requisite service period had not previously been rendered 
the increase in expense in over is due to additional stock option grants awarded during the year 
prior to  the company applied the intrinsic value method of measuring compensation costs which did not trigger expense recognition in prior periods 
the company uses stock based compensation to retain existing employees  recruit new employees and is considered an important part of overall compensation 
the company expects to continue using stock based compensation in the future 
occupancy costs 
occupancy costs for increased million  or  to million 
occupancy costs for increased million  or  to million compared to the increase in related to an increase in rent expense on newly leased facilities and leases that adjust annually and maintenance contracts  offset by decreases in depreciation on software and hardware that had reached the end of their depreciable lives 
the company expects depreciation expense to increase again in subsequent years as new information technology projects are deployed 
the increase in was primarily due to depreciation of leasehold improvements of million and an increase in common area maintenance of million 
other operating expenses 
other operating expenses for increased million  or  to million compared to in  other operating expenses increased million  or  to million compared to other operating expense is comprised of marketing  office supplies  professional services  correspondent banking charges  regulatory assessments and operational losses 
the increase in was primarily due to professional services million  marketing million  branding initiatives million and regulatory assessments million 
professional services increased primarily due to third party referral fees paid on investment banking transactions  expenses for investment advisory back office support  and accounting and legal costs 
marketing increased as a result of initiatives to increase our loan and deposit bases and grow our fee based business lines 
costs for the branding initiative related to the unification of the cobiz name across all of the company s subsidiaries 
the increase in regulatory assessments was primarily caused by the fdic s increase in assessment rates 
the increase in was primarily due to marketing costs needed to support our business development efforts 
loss on sale of other assets and securities 
the million loss in was due to a million loss on the sale of repossessed assets and million related to the loss on sale and call of investment securities 
the million loss in was related to a rebalancing of our investment portfolio where we sold certain securities and purchased other shorter term securities and reduced our wholesale funding 
federal income taxes 
the provision for income taxes totaled million during  compared to million in and million in the effective tax rates for  and were  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources our liquidity management objective is to ensure our ability to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  and to allow us to sustain our operations 
historically  our primary source of funds has been customer deposits 
scheduled loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  while deposit inflows and unscheduled loan prepayments which are influenced by fluctuations in the general level of interest rates  returns available on other investments  competition  economic conditions and other factors are less predictable 
in addition  the company has commitments to extend credit under lines of credit and stand by letters of credit 
the company has also committed to investing in certain partnerships 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on these commitments 
borrowings may be used on a short term basis to compensate for reductions in other sources of funds such as deposit inflows at less than projected levels 
borrowings may also be used on a longer term basis to support expanded lending activities and to match the maturity or repricing intervals of assets 
the company is required under federal banking regulations to maintain sufficient reserves to fund deposit withdrawals  loan commitments and expenses 
we monitor our cash position on a daily basis in order to meet these requirements 
we use various forms of short term borrowings for cash management and liquidity purposes on a limited basis 
these forms of borrowings include federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  the state of colorado treasury s time deposit program and borrowings from the fhlb 
the bank has approved federal funds purchase lines with other banks with an aggregate credit line of million 
the bank also has a line of credit from the fhlb  lines of credit with three firms to transact repurchase agreements and the bank may apply for state of colorado time deposits  all of which are limited by the amount of eligible collateral available to secure the borrowings 
borrowings under the fhlb line are required to be secured by unpledged securities and qualifying loans 
at december   we had million in unpledged securities and qualifying loans available to collateralize fhlb borrowings and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
during  the bank began participating in the us treasury s term investment option tio program for treasury tax and loan participants 
the tio program allows us to obtain additional short term funds at a rate determined through an auction process that is limited by the amount of eligible collateral available to secure it 
at the holding company level  our primary source of funds are dividends paid from the bank and our fee based business lines  management fees assessed to the bank and the fee based business lines  proceeds from the issuance of common stock  lines of credit and other capital markets activity 
additionally  in august  the company entered into a million revolving line of credit agreement to be used for general corporate purposes 
the main use of this liquidity is the quarterly payment of dividends on our common stock  quarterly interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures  payments for merger and acquisition activity including potential earn out payments  and payments for the salaries and employee benefits for the employees of the holding company 
the approval of the colorado division of banking is required prior to the declaration of any dividend by the bank if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year exceeds the total of its net profits for that year combined with the retained net profits for the preceding two years 
in addition  the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of provides that the bank cannot pay a dividend if it will cause the bank to be undercapitalized 
the company s ability to pay dividends on its common stock depends upon the availability of dividends from the bank and earnings from its fee based businesses  as well as the company s compliance with the capital adequacy guidelines of the frb 
see item business supervision and regulation and note to our consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the compliance of the bank and cobiz with applicable capital adequacy guidelines 
maintaining adequate capital levels is integral to providing stability to the company  resources to achieve the company s growth objectives and returns to the shareholders in the form of dividends 
in addition  as described above in business supervision and regulation  federal regulations establish minimum requirements for the capital adequacy of the company and the bank 
we continually monitor existing and alternative financing sources to support our capital and liquidity needs  including but not limited to  debt issuance  common stock issuance and deposit funding sources 
based on our current financial condition and our results of operations  we believe that the company will be able to raise adequate capital through one of these financing sources  as needed 
the company has issued a total of million of trust preferred securities through statutory trusts that are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
although the accounts of the trusts are not included in the company s consolidated financial statements  million of the million in trust preferred securities issued by the trusts are included in tier capital for regulatory capital purposes as allowed by the federal reserve board 
on february   the federal reserve board finalized a rule that would continue to allow the inclusion of trust preferred securities issued by unconsolidated subsidiary trusts in tier capital  but with stricter quantitative and qualitative standards 
under the rule  after a transition period ending on march   the aggregate amount of trust preferred securities and certain other capital elements would be limited to of tier capital elements  net of goodwill that has been reduced by any associated deferred tax liability 
the amount of trust preferred securities and certain other elements in excess of the limit could be included in tier capital  subject to restrictions 
based on the final rule  the company s allowable trust preferred securities in tier capital would decrease to million if it had been in effect at december  the additional amount excluded from tier capital would be included in tier capital and the company would still be adequately capitalized 
on november   the company filed a universal shelf registration that allows the company to issue any combination of debt securities  preferred stock  depositary shares  common stock and securities warrants from time to time in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of million 
a new universal shelf registration was filed on january  to allow for the sale of common stock by affiliates of the company and the original universal shelf registration was withdrawn 
on january   pursuant to the universal shelf registration  we sold  shares of common stock at a public offering price of 
in conjunction with the offering  our ceo  one member of our board of directors and the estate of one former member of our board of directors selling shareholders sold  shares of common stock 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling shareholders 
on july   the company s board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for the repurchase of up to of its outstanding stock 
share repurchases under this program were to made through open market purchases  block trades or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time and in compliance with rule b under the exchange act 
the program concluded on november   when all authorized shares had been repurchased 
the shares were repurchased at a weighted average price of and a total cost of million 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and is comprised of the company s net income  adjusted for non cash charges and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
our cash uses for operations are expected to continue to grow through the deployment of our de novo strategy and development of our existing branches and fee based business lines in their respective markets 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase of million in cash used was primarily caused by a million increase in loan originations in over also contributing to the increase was a million purchase of boli and million used in the acquisition of wagner 
these increases cash outflows to cash used in investing activities were offset by a million increase in cash inflows from investment activities 
the reduction in our customer securities sold under agreement to repurchase contracts allowed for the reduction in our securities portfolio 
the decrease of million in cash used was impacted by transactions in our investment portfolio  proceeds from the sale and maturity of investments increased million inflow  offset by an million increase in investment purchases 
in addition  net loan originations decreased million  purchases of boli policies decreased million and earn out payments for acquired subsidiaries decreased million 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase in compared to is related to an increase of million in deposit balances 
this increase was offset by a net cash outflow of million in securities sold under agreement to repurchase 
the million decrease in net cash provided by these activities in compared to was the result of a million decrease in net deposit inflows and a million decrease in short term borrowings including customer repurchases 
the company reduced the level of investment securities during and  allowing us to reduce the level of wholesale borrowing fed funds purchased  fhlb advances and street repurchase agreements dur ing those years 
we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents  expected cash flows from operations together with our available lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  loan originations  capital expenditures and other obligations for at least the next months 
contractual obligations and commitments summarized below are the company s contractual obligations excluding deposit liabilities to make future payments at december  in thousands within one year after one but within three years after three but within five years after five years total federal funds purchased fhlb overnight funds purchased repurchase agreements junior subordinated debentures operating lease obligations revolving line of credit supplemental executive retirement plan total contractual obligations includes interest payments of million due within one year and million due after one but within three years 
interest reported above was calculated at the actual borrowing rate at december  assumes each junior subordinated debenture remains outstanding until corresponding earliest call date 
because interest rates paid on junior subordinated debentures are variable rates  actual interest payments will differ based on actual libor rates and actual amounts outstanding for the applicable periods 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on junior subordinated debentures 
includes interest payments of million due within one year 
for amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit facility  interest reported above was calculated using the actual borrowing rate and amount outstanding at december  because the interest rate paid under the revolving credit facility is a variable rate  actual interest payments will differ based on the benchmark rate and actual amounts outstanding for the applicable periods 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our revolving line of credit facility 
the company has employed a strategy to expand its offering of fee based products through the acquisition of entities that complement its business model 
we will often structure the purchase price of an acquired entity to include an earn out  which is a contingent payment based on achieving future performance levels 
given the uncertainty of today s economic climate and the performance challenges it creates for companies  we feel the use of earn outs in acquisitions is an effective method to bridge the expectation gap between a buyer s caution and a seller s optimism 
earn outs help to protect buyers from paying a full valuation up front without the assurance of the acquisition s performance  while allowing sellers to participate in the full value of the company provided the anticipated performance does occur 
since the earn out payments are determined based on the acquired company s performance during the earn out period  the total payments to be made are not known at the time of the acquisition 
the company has committed to make additional earn out payments to the former owners of wagner based on earnings and performance 
at december   the company did not accrue for any earn out payments for the fiscal year the contractual amount of the company s financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  expiring by period at december   is presented below after one after three within but within but within after in thousands one year three years five years five years total unfunded loan commitments standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit unfunded commitments for unconsolidated investments company guarantees total commitments the company is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the liquidity  credit enhancement and financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include legally binding commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized on the balance sheet 
credit risk is the principal risk associated with these instruments 
the contractual amounts of these instruments represent the amount of credit risk should the instruments be fully drawn upon and the customer defaults 
to control the credit risk associated with entering into commitments and issuing letters of credit  the company uses the same credit quality  collateral policies and monitoring controls in making commitments and letters of credit as it does with its lending activities 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation 
legally binding commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments may expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit obligate the company to meet certain financial obligations of its customers if  under the contractual terms of the agreement  the customers are unable to do so 
the financial standby letters of credit issued by the company are irrevocable 
payment is only guaranteed under these letters of credit upon the borrower s failure to perform its obligations to the beneficiary 
approximately million of total commitments at december   represent commitments to extend credit at fixed rates of interest  which exposes the company to some degree of interest rate risk 
the company has also entered into interest rate swap agreements under which it is required to either receive or pay cash to a counterparty depending on changes in interest rates 
the interest rate swaps are carried at their fair value on the consolidated balance sheet with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates at the balance sheet date 
interest rate swaps recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at december   do not represent amounts that will ultimately be received or paid under the contract and are therefore excluded from the table above 
effects of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on our operations is increased operating costs 
unlike most retail or manufacturing companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution such as the company are monetary in nature 
as a result  the impact of interest rates on a financial institution s performance is generally greater than the impact of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction  or to the same extent  as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not move in the same direction  or at the same magnitude  as inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management asset liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of repricing assets compared to liabilities 
it is our objective to generate stable growth in net interest income and to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  our strategy is to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income by maintaining a favorable match between the maturities or repricing dates of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we adjust interest sensitivity during the year through changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
our asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored by the asset liability management committee  in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors of the bank 
this committee meets regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  purchase and sale activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the asset liability committee also approves and establishes pricing and funding decisions with respect to our overall asset and liability composition 
the committee reviews our liquidity  cash flow flexibility  maturities of investments  deposits and borrowings  deposit activity  current market conditions  and general levels of interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  we use simulation analysis to determine the impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various interest rate scenarios 
from these simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the following table presents an analysis of the interest rate sensitivity inherent in our net interest income and market value of equity 
the interest rate scenario presented in the table includes interest rates at december   as adjusted by instantaneous rate changes upward and downward of up to basis points 
since there are limitations inherent in any methodology used to estimate the exposure to changes in market interest rates  this analysis is not intended to be a forecast of the actual effect of a change in market interest rates 
the market value sensitivity analysis presented includes assumptions that i the composition of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities existing at december   will remain constant over the month measurement period  and ii that changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  the analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on us 
change in interest rates in basis points impact on net interest income market value of equity our results of operations depend significantly on net interest income 
like most financial institutions  our interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the marketplace 
rising and falling interest rate environments can have various impacts on net interest income  depending on the interest rate profile ie  the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the relative changes in interest rates that occur when various assets and liabilities reprice  unscheduled repayments of loans and investments  early withdrawals of deposits  and other factors 
as a general rule  banks with positive interest rate gaps are more likely to be susceptible to declines in net interest income in periods of falling interest rates  while banks with negative interest rate gaps are more likely to experience declines in net interest income in periods of rising interest rates 
at december   our cumulative interest rate gap was a positive 
therefore  assuming no change in our gap position  a rise in interest rates is likely to result in increased net interest income  while a decline in interest rates is likely to result in decreased net interest income 
this is a point in time position that is continually changing and is not indicative of our position at any other time 
while the gap position is a useful tool in measuring interest rate risk and contributes toward effective asset and liability management  shortcomings are inherent in gap analysis since certain assets and liabilities may not move proportionally as interest rates change 
consequently  in addition to gap analysis  we use the simulation model discussed above to test the interest rate sensitivity of net interest income and the balance sheet 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing  and the resulting interest rate gap  of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  all amounts in the table are based on contractual repricing schedules 
actual prepayment and withdrawal experience may vary significantly from the assumptions reflected in the table 
for information on the fair value of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities see note to our consolidated financial statements 
estimated maturity or repricing at december  three months less than to less than one to over in thousands three months one year five years five years total interest earning assets cash and equivalents fixed rate loans floating rate loans investment securities held to maturity and available for sale total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities now and money market deposits savings deposits eurodollar deposits certificates of deposits under  certificates of deposits  and over securities sold under agreements to repurchase other short term borrowings junior subordinated debentures total interest bearing liabilities interest rate gap cumulative interest rate gap cumulative interest rate gap to total assets to manage the relationship of our interest earning assets and liabilities  we evaluate the following factors liquidity  equity  debt capital ratio  anticipated prepayment rates  portfolio maturities  maturing assets and maturing liabilities 
our asset liability management committee is responsible for establishing procedures that enable us to achieve our goals while adhering to prudent banking practices and existing loan and investment policies 
we have focused on maintaining balance between interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and repricing frequencies 
an important element of this focus has been to emphasize variable rate loans and investments funded by deposits that also mature or reprice over periods of months or less 
the following table presents  at december   loans by maturity in each major category of our portfolio 
actual maturities may differ from the contractual maturities shown below as a result of renewals and prepayments 
loan renewals are evaluated in the same manner as new credit applications 
at december  less than one to over in thousands one year five years five years total commercial real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer other total loans and leases of the million of loans with maturities of one year or more  approximately million were fixed rate loans and million were variable rate loans at december  to augment our asset and liability management strategy  we also began using interest rate swaps in  with the overall goal of minimizing the impact of interest rate fluctuations on our net interest margin 
interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed rate and variable rate interest payment obligations without the exchange of the underlying notional amounts 
since we implemented the program in  we have entered into different interest rate swap agreements as summarized in the table below 
under the interest rate swap agreements  we receive a fixed rate and pay a variable rate based on the prime rate 
the swaps qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and are designated as hedges of the variability of cash flows we receive from certain of our prime indexed loans 
in accordance with sfas  these swap agreements are measured at fair value and reported as assets or liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the portion of the change in the fair value of the swaps that is deemed effective in hedging the cash flows of the designated assets are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax effects oci and reclassified into interest income when such cash flows occur in the future 
any ineffectiveness resulting from the hedges is recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income as a part of noninterest income 
interest rate swap information at december  is summarized as follows in thousands fixed fair market amortization of notional swap maturity date rate notional value swap may  june  swap july  july  swap july  august  swap august  september  swap october  october  swap october  november  swap november  december  swap january  december  swap april  january  swap may  february  swap july  march  swap january  april  swap april  may  swap may  june  swap august  august  swap october  october  total during  and  net interest income was decreased increased by million  million and million  respectively  from the settlement of the interest rate swaps
