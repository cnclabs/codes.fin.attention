westfield financial s consolidated results of operations are comprised of earnings on investments and the net income recorded by its principal operating subsidiary  westfield bank 
westfield bank s consolidated results of operations depend primarily on net interest and dividend income 
net interest and dividend income is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
interest earning assets consist primarily of commercial real estate loans  commercial and industrial loans  residential real estate loans  consumer loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of certificates of deposit and money market account  now account and savings account deposits and borrowings from the federal home loan bank of boston 
the consolidated results of operations also depend on provision for loan losses  noninterest income  and noninterest expense 
noninterest expense includes salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expenses and other general and administrative expenses 
noninterest income includes service fees and charges  income on bank owned life insurance  and gains losses on sales of securities 
critical accounting policies 
westfield financial s accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
given westfield financial s current business strategy and asset liability structure  the more critical policies are accounting for nonperforming loans  the allowance for loan losses and provision for loan losses  the classification of securities as either held to maturity or available for sale  other than temporary impairment of securities  and discount rate assumptions used for benefit liabilities 
in addition to the informational disclosure in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  westfield financial s policy on each of these accounting policies is described in detail in the applicable sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of these accounting estimates and the related disclosures with the audit committee of westfield financial s board of directors 
on a quarterly basis  westfield financial reviews investment securities with unrealized depreciation on a judgmental basis to assess whether the decline in fair value is temporary or other than temporary 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of westfield financial to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
securities  including mortgage backed securities  which management has the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity and are carried at amortized cost 
securities  including mortgage backed securities  that have been identified as assets for which there is not a positive intent to hold to maturity are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  net of income taxes  reported as a separate component of equity 
accordingly  a misclassification would have a direct effect on stockholders equity 
sales or reclassification as available for sale except for certain permitted reasons of held to maturity securities may result in the reclassification of all such securities to available for sale 
westfield financial has never sold held to maturity securities or reclassified such securities to available for sale other than in specifically permitted circumstances 
westfield financial does not acquire securities or mortgage backed securities for purposes of engaging in trading activities 
westfield financial s general policy is to discontinue the accrual of interest when principal or interest payments are delinquent days or more  or earlier if the loan is considered impaired 
any unpaid amounts previously accrued on these loans are reversed from income 
subsequent cash receipts are applied to the outstanding principal balance or to interest income if  in the judgment of management  collection of principal balance is not in question 
loans are returned to accrual status when they become current as to both principal and interest and when subsequent performance reduces the concern as to the collectibility of principal and interest 
loan fees and certain direct loan origination costs are deferred  and the net fee or cost is recognized as an adjustment to interest income over the estimated average lives of the related loans 
the process of evaluating the loan portfolio  classifying loans and determining the allowance and provision is described in detail in business of westfield financial and westfield bank lending activities allowance for loan losses 
westfield financial s methodology for assessing the allocation of the allowance consists of two key components  which are a specific allowance for identified problems or impaired loans and a formula allowance for the remainder of the portfolio 
measurement of impairment can be based on present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant change 
the allocation of the allowance is also reviewed by management based upon its evaluation of then existing economic and business conditions affecting westfield financial s key lending areas and other conditions  such as new loan products  credit quality trends including trends in nonperforming loans expected to result from existing conditions  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  specific industry conditions within portfolio segments that existed as of the balance sheet date and the impact that such conditions were believed to have had on the collectibility of the loan portfolio 
although management believes it has established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels  future adjustments may be necessary if economic  real estate and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
the discount rate assumptions used to measure benefit liabilities are set to reflect prevailing yields on high quality fixed income investments 
a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases pension expense

the yields and costs were derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the years shown

westfield financial s primary sources of liquidity are deposits  scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal and mortgage backed securities  maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by our operations 
westfield bank also can borrow funds from the federal home loan bank based on eligible collateral of loans and securities 
outstanding borrowings from the federal home loan bank were million at december  and million at december  at december   westfield bank had million in available borrowing capacity with the federal home loan bank

reverse repurchase agreements are agreements that allow westfield bank to borrow money using its securities as collateral 
westfield bank also has outstanding at any time  a significant number of commitments to extend credit and provide financial guarantees to third parties 
these arrangements are subject to strict credit control assessments 
guarantees specify limits to westfield bank s obligations 
because many commitments and almost all guarantees expire without being funded in whole or in part  the contract amounts are not estimates of future cash flows 
westfield bank is also obligated under agreements with the federal home loan bank to repay borrowed funds and is obligated under leases for certain of its branches and equipment

maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds 
however  deposit flows  calls of securities and prepayments of loans and mortgage backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates  general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace 
these factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds 
westfield financial s primary investing activities are the origination of commercial real estate  commercial and industrial and consumer loans  and the purchase of mortgage backed and other investment securities 
during the year ended december   westfield bank originated loans of approximately million  and during the comparable period of  westfield bank originated loans of approximately million 
under westfield bank s residential real estate loan program  westfield bank refers its residential real estate borrowers to a third party mortgage company and substantially all of westfield bank s residential real estate loans are underwritten  originated and serviced by a third party mortgage company 
purchases of securities totaled million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  at december   westfield bank had loan commitments to borrowers of approximately million  and available home equity and unadvanced lines of credit of approximately million 
deposit flows are affected by the level of interest rates  by the interest rates and products offered by competitors and by other factors 
total deposits decreased million during the year ended december  and increased million during the year ended december  time deposit accounts scheduled to mature within one year were million at december  based on westfield bank s deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy  it anticipates that a significant portion of these certificates of deposit will remain on deposit

off balance sheet arrangements westfield financial does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
management of market risk as a financial institution  westfield financial s primary market risk is interest rate risk since substantially all transactions are denominated in us dollars with no direct foreign exchange or changes in commodity price exposure 
fluctuations in interest rates will affect both our level of income and expense on a large portion of our assets and liabilities 
fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of all interest earning assets 
the primary goal of westfield financial s interest rate management strategy is to limit fluctuations in net interest income as interest rates vary up or down and control variations in the market value of assets  liabilities and net worth as interest rates vary 
westfield financial seeks to coordinate asset and liability decisions so that  under changing interest rate scenarios  net interest income will remain within an acceptable range 
to achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk  westfield bank s asset and liability management committee meets monthly to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment relative to interest rates that are offered on its products 
the asset and liability management committee presents periodic reports to the board of directors of westfield bank and westfield financial  inc at their regular meetings 
in recent years  westfield bank s lending activities have emphasized commercial real estate and commercial and industrial loans 
commercial real estate loans have grown million or since december  commercial and industrial loans have grown million or since december  management believes that westfield bank s increased emphasis on commercial lending has allowed it to diversify its loan portfolio while continuing to meet the needs of the businesses and individuals that it serves 
westfield bank s primary source of funds has been deposits  consisting primarily of time deposits  money market accounts  savings accounts  demand accounts and now accounts  which have shorter terms to maturity than the loan portfolio 
several strategies have been employed to manage the interest rate risk inherent in the asset liability mix  including but not limited to o maintaining the diversity of westfield bank s existing loan portfolio through the origination of commercial loans and commercial real estate loans which typically have variable rates and shorter terms than residential mortgages  and o emphasizing investments with an expected average duration of five years or less 
in addition  emphasis on commercial loans has reduced the average maturity of westfield bank s loan portfolio 
moreover  the actual amount of time before loans are repaid can be significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
prepayment rates will also vary due to a number of other factors  including the regional economy in the area where the loans were originated  seasonal factors  demographic variables and the assumability of the loans 
however  the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates  related financing opportunities and competition 
westfield financial monitors interest rate sensitivity so that it can adjust its asset and liability mix in a timely manner and minimize the negative effects of changing rates 
each of westfield bank s sources of liquidity is vulnerable to various uncertainties beyond the control of westfield bank 
scheduled loan and security payments are a relatively stable source of funds  while loan and security prepayments and calls  and deposit flows vary widely in reaction to market conditions  primarily prevailing interest rates 
asset sales are influenced by pledging activities  general market interest rates and unforeseen market conditions 
westfield bank s financial condition is affected by its ability to borrow at attractive rates  retain deposits at market rates and other market conditions 
management considers westfield bank s sources of liquidity to be adequate to meet expected funding needs and also to be responsive to changing interest rate markets 
net interest and dividend income simulation 
we use a simulation model to monitor interest rate risk 
this model reports the net interest income at risk primarily under seven different interest rate environments 
specifically  net interest income is measured in one scenario that assumes no change in interest rates  and six scenarios where interest rates increase  and and decrease  and basis points  respectively  from current rates over the one year time period following the current consolidated financial statements 
the changes in interest income and interest expense due to changes in interest rates reflect the rate sensitivity of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment  the interest income from an adjustable rate loan is likely to increase depending on its repricing characteristics while the interest income from a fixed rate loan would not increase until the funds were repaid and loaned out at a higher interest rate 
the tables below set forth as of december  the estimated changes in net interest and dividend income that would result from incremental changes in interest rates over the applicable twelve month period 
for the year ending december  dollars in thousands changes in net interest interest rates basis and dividend points income change  market rates were assumed to increase  and basis points and decrease  and basis points  in even increments over the twelve month period 
the repricing and or new rates of assets and liabilities moved in tandem with market rates 
however  in certain deposit products  the use of data from a historical analysis indicated that the rates on these products would move only a fraction of the rate change amount 
we have developed consolidated balance sheet growth projections for the twelve month period 
the same product mix and growth strategy was used for all rate change simulations  except for the shift into term deposits in certain scenarios as described in the previous paragraph 
income from tax exempt assets is calculated on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
pertinent data from each loan account  deposit account and investment security was used to calculate future cash flows 
the data included such items as maturity date  payment amount  next repricing date  repricing frequency  repricing index and spread 
prepayment speed assumptions were based upon the difference between the account rate and the current market rate 
the income simulation analysis was based upon a variety of assumptions 
these assumptions include but are not limited to balance sheet growth  asset mix  prepayment speeds  the timing and level of interest rates  and the shape of the yield curve 
as market conditions vary from the assumptions in the income simulation analysis  actual results will differ 
as a result  the income simulation analysis does not serve as a forecast of net interest income  nor do the calculations represent any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  which amends fasb statement no 
this statement requires that all separately recognized servicing rights be initially measured at fair value  if practicable 
for each class of separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities  this statement permits an entity to choose either of the following subsequent measurement methods amortize servicing assets or liabilities in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income or net servicing loss  or report servicing assets or liabilities at fair value at each reporting date and report changes in fair value in earnings in the period in which the changes occur the fair value method 
this statement was effective for new transactions occurring and for subsequent measurement as of january  management did not adopt the fair value method of accounting for its servicing rights 
therefore  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on westfield financial s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued financial accounting standards interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures and transitions 
westfield financial adopted fin on january  and this adoption did not have a material impact on westfield financial s consolidated financial statements 
westfield financial accounts for interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as part of its provision for federal and state income taxes 
westfield financial has no penalties or interest recorded for the year ended december  in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the definition of fair value retains the exchange price notion in earlier definitions of fair value 
this statement clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell the asset or transfer the liability in the market in which the reporting entity would transact for the asset or liability  that is  the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
emphasis is placed on fair value being a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and therefore a fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
as a basis for considering these market participant assumptions  a fair value hierarchy has been established to distinguish between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
this statement is effective for westfield financial on january  management has determined that the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on westfield financial s consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value  which the objective of improving financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions  and is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement 
an entity will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option may generally be applied instrument by instrument and is irrevocable 
this statement is effective for westfield financial on january  and is not expected to have a material impact on westfield financial s consolidated financial statement 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
revised  business combinations 
this statement replaces fasb statement no 
 and applies to all business entities  including mutual entities that previously used the pooling of interests method of accounting for certain business combinations 
under statement no 
revised an acquirer is required to recognize at fair value the assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date 
this replaces the cost allocation process under statement no 
 which resulted in the non recognition of some assets and liabilities at the acquisition date and in measuring some assets and liabilities at amounts other than their fair values at the acquisition date 
this statement requires that acquisition costs and expected restructuring costs be recognized separately from the acquisition  and that the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities  as well as the non controlling interest in the acquiree  at the full amounts of their fair values 
this statement also requires an acquirer to recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies as of the acquisition date  while statement allowed for the deferred recognition of pre acquisition contingencies until certain recognition criteria were met  and an acquirer is only required to recognize assets or liabilities arising from all other contingencies if it is more likely than not that they meet the definition of an asset or a liability 
under this statement  an acquirer is required to recognize contingent consideration at the acquisition date  whereas contingent consideration obligations usually were not recognized at the acquisition date under statement further  this statement eliminates the concept of negative goodwill and requires gain recognition in instances in which the total acquisition date fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of the consideration transferred plus any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
this statement makes significant amendments to other statements and other authoritative guidance  and applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  an entity may not apply it before that date 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
it clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes of westfield financial have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of westfield financial s operations 
unlike industrial companies  westfield financial s assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation
