table of contents part i item business overview commercial vehicle group  inc a delaware corporation formed in august and its subsidiaries  is a leading supplier of fully integrated system solutions for the global commercial vehicle market  including the heavy duty truck market  the construction and agriculture markets and the specialty and military transportation markets 
our products include static and suspension seat systems  interior trim systems including instrument panels  door panels  headliners  cabinetry and floor systems  cab structures and components  mirrors  wiper systems  electronic wire harness assemblies and controls and switches specifically designed for applications in commercial vehicles 
we are differentiated from suppliers to the automotive industry by our ability to manufacture low volume customized products on a sequenced basis to meet the requirements of our customers 
we believe that we have the number one or two position in most of our major markets and that we are the only supplier in the north american commercial vehicle market that can offer complete cab systems including cab body assemblies  sleeper boxes  seats  interior trim  flooring  wire harnesses  panel assemblies and other structural components 
we believe our products are used by virtually every major north american commercial vehicle original equipment manufacturer oem  which we believe creates an opportunity to cross sell our products and offer a fully integrated system solution 
demand for our products is generally dependent on the number of new commercial vehicles manufactured  which in turn is a function of general economic conditions  interest rates  changes in governmental regulations  consumer spending  fuel costs and our customers inventory levels and production rates 
new commercial vehicle demand in the north american class truck market has historically been cyclical and is particularly sensitive to the industrial sector of the economy  which generates a significant portion of the freight tonnage hauled by commercial vehicles 
production of class heavy trucks in north america initially peaked in and experienced a downturn from to that was due to a weak economy  an oversupply of new and used vehicle inventory and lower spending on commercial vehicles and equipment 
demand for commercial vehicles improved from to due to broad economic recovery in north america  corresponding growth in the movement of goods  the growing need to replace aging truck fleets and oems receiving larger than expected pre orders in anticipation of the new epa emissions standards becoming effective in during  the demand for north american class heavy trucks experienced a downturn as a result of pre orders in and general weakness in the north american economy and corresponding decline in the need for commercial vehicles to haul freight tonnage in north america 
new commercial vehicle demand in the global construction equipment market generally follows certain economic conditions around the world 
within the construction market  there are two classes of construction equipment  the medium heavy equipment market weighing over metric tons and the light construction equipment market weighing below metric tons 
demand in the medium heavy construction equipment market is typically related to the level of larger scale infrastructure development projects such as highways  dams  harbors  hospitals  airports and industrial development as well as activity in the mining  forestry and other raw material based industries 
demand in the light construction equipment market is typically related to certain economic conditions such as the level of housing construction and other smaller scale developments and projects 
our products are primarily used in the medium heavy construction equipment markets 
recent acquisitions in october  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of pekm kabeltechnik sro pekm  an electronic wire harness manufacturer primarily for the commercial truck market  with facilities in the czech republic and the ukraine 
in october  we acquired the heavy gauge thermoforming and injection molding assets of the fabrication division of gage industries  inc gage 

table of contents in december  we acquired substantially all of the assets of short bark industries  llc sbi  a supplier of seat covers and various cut and sew trim products 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for detailed information on these transactions 
industry within the commercial vehicle industry  we sell our products primarily to the north american heavy truck oem market approximately of our revenues  the global construction oem market approximately of our revenues and the aftermarket and oem service organizations approximately of our revenues 
the majority of our remaining of revenues was derived primarily from other global commercial vehicle and specialty markets 
commercial vehicle supply market overview commercial vehicles are used in a wide variety of end markets  including local and long haul commercial trucking  bus  construction  mining  general industrial  marine  municipal and recreation 
the commercial vehicle supply industry can generally be separated into two categories sales to oems  in which products are sold in relatively large quantities directly for use by oems in new commercial vehicles  and aftermarket sales  in which products are sold as replacements in varying quantities to a wide range of oem service organizations  wholesalers  retailers and installers 
in the oem market  suppliers are generally divided into tiers tier suppliers like our company  who provide their products directly to oems  and tier or tier suppliers  who sell their products principally to other suppliers for integration into those suppliers own product offerings 
our largest end market  the commercial truck and construction industry  is supplied by heavy and medium duty commercial vehicle suppliers as well as automotive suppliers 
the commercial vehicle supplier industry is highly fragmented and comprised of several large companies and many smaller companies 
in addition  the commercial vehicle supplier industry is characterized by relatively low production volumes as well as considerable barriers to entry  including the following significant investment requirements  stringent technical and manufacturing requirements  high transition costs to shift production to new suppliers  just in time delivery requirements and strong brand name recognition 
foreign competition is limited in the commercial vehicle market due to many factors  including the need to be responsive to order changes on short notice  high shipping costs  customer concerns about quality given the safety aspect of many of our products and service requirements 
although oem demand for our products is directly correlated with new vehicle production  suppliers like us can also grow by increasing their product content per vehicle through cross selling and bundling of products  further penetrating business with existing customers  gaining new customers and expanding into new geographic markets and by increasing aftermarket sales 
we believe that companies with a global presence and advanced technology  engineering  manufacturing and support capabilities  such as our company  are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities 
north american commercial truck market purchasers of commercial trucks include fleet operators  owner operators and other industrial end users 
commercial vehicles used for local and long haul commercial trucking are generally classified by gross vehicle weight 
class vehicles are trucks with gross vehicle weight in excess of  lbs 
and class through vehicles are trucks with gross vehicle weight from  lbs 
to  lbs 
the following table shows commercial vehicle production levels for through in north america thousands of units class heavy trucks class light and medium duty trucks total source act publications  the commercial truck  bus and trailer industry outlook february 

table of contents the following describes the major segments of the commercial vehicle market in which we compete class truck market the global class truck manufacturing market is concentrated in three primary regions north america  asia pacific and europe 
the global class truck market is localized in nature due to the following factors the prohibitive costs of shipping components from one region to another  the high degree of customization of class trucks to meet the region specific demands of end users  and the ability to meet just in time delivery requirements 
according to act  four companies represented approximately of north american class truck production in the percentages of class production represented by freightliner  paccar  international and volvo mack were approximately   and  respectively 
we supply products to all of these oems 
production of commercial vehicles in north america initially peaked in and experienced a downturn from to that was due to a weak economy  reduced sales following above normal purchases in advance of new epa emissions standards that became effective in october  an oversupply of new and used vehicle inventory and lower spending on commercial vehicles and equipment 
following a substantial decline from to  class truck unit production increased modestly to approximately  units in from approximately  units in  due primarily to the purchasing of trucks that occurred prior to the october mandate for more stringent engine emissions requirements 
subsequent to the engine emissions requirements  truck production continued to remain at historically low levels through mid due to continuing economic weakness and the reluctance of many trucking companies to invest during this period 
in mid  evidence of renewed growth emerged and truck tonmiles number of miles driven multiplied by number of tons transported began to increase  along with new truck sales 
during the second half of  new truck dealer inventories declined and  consequently  oem truck order backlogs began to increase 
according to act  monthly truck order rates began increasing significantly from december through in  oems received larger than expected pre orders in anticipation of the new epa emissions standards becoming effective in during  the demand for north american class heavy trucks experienced a downturn as a result of pre orders  a general weakness in the north american economy and corresponding decline in the need for commercial vehicles to haul freight tonnage in north america 
the following table illustrates north american class truck build for the years to north american class truck build rates in thousands graph e estimated source act publications  five year forecast february 

table of contents according to act  unit production for is estimated to increase approximately from levels to approximately  units 
we believe that the decrease from to was impacted by the more stringent epa emissions standards becoming effective in early as well as a general weakness in the north american economy and corresponding decline in the need for commercial vehicles to haul freight tonnage in north america 
we believe the following factors are currently driving the north american class truck market economic conditions 
the north american truck industry is directly influenced by overall economic growth and consumer spending 
since truck oems supply the fleet lines of north america  their production levels generally match the demand for freight 
the freight carried by these trucks includes consumer goods  machinery  food and beverages  construction equipment and supplies  electronic equipment and a wide variety of other materials 
since most of these items are driven by macroeconomic conditions  the truck industry tends to follow trends of gross domestic product gdp 
generally  given the dependence of north american shippers on trucking as a freight alternative  general economic conditions have been a primary indicator of future truck builds 
truck freight growth 
act projects that total domestic truck freight will continue to increase over the next five years  driven by growth in gdp 
in addition  national suppliers and distribution centers  burdened by the pricing pressure of large manufacturing and retail customers  have continued to reduce on site inventory levels 
this reduction requires freight handlers to provide to the hour delivery options 
as a result  class trucks have replaced manufacturing warehouses as the preferred temporary storage facility for inventory 
since trucks are typically viewed as the most reliable and flexible shipping alternative  truck tonmiles  as well as truck platform improvements  should continue to increase in order to meet the increasing need for flexibility under a just in time system 
act forecasts that total us class truck tonmiles will increase from million in to million in  as summarized in the following graph total us tonmiles class number of tonmiles in millions graph e estimated source act publications  five year forecast february 
truck replacement cycle and fleet aging 
since  the average age of active class trucks has increased from approximately years in to approximately years in the average fleet age tends to run in cycles as freight companies permit their truck fleets to age during periods of lagging demand and then replenish those fleets during periods of increasing demand 
additionally  as truck fleets age  their maintenance costs typically increase 
freight companies must therefore continually evaluate the economics between repair and replacement 
other factors  such as inventory management and the growth in less than truckload freight shipping  also tend to 
table of contents increase fleet mileage and  as a result  the truck replacement cycle 
the chart below illustrates the average age of active us class trucks average age of active us class trucks number of years graph e estimated source act research 
commercial truck aftermarket demand for aftermarket products tends to be counter cyclical to oem demand because vehicle owners are more likely to repair vehicles than purchase new ones during recessionary periods 
therefore  aftermarket demand moderately increases during such periods 
demand for aftermarket products is driven by the quality of oem parts  the number of vehicles in operation  the average age of the vehicle fleet  vehicle usage  the average useful life of vehicle parts and total truck tonmiles 
the aftermarket is a growing market  as the overall size of the north american fleet of class trucks has continued to increase and is attractive because of the recurring nature of the sales 
additionally  aftermarket sales tend to be at a higher margin  as truck component suppliers are able to leverage their already established fixed cost base and exert moderate pricing power with their replacement parts 
the recurring nature of aftermarket revenue provides some insulation to the overall cyclical nature of the industry  as it tends to provide a more stable stream of revenues 
commercial construction vehicle market new commercial vehicle demand in the global construction equipment market generally follows certain economic conditions around the world 
within the construction market  there are two classes of construction equipment the medium heavy equipment market weighing over metric tons and the light construction equipment market weighing below metric tons 
demand in the medium heavy construction equipment market is typically related to the level of larger scale infrastructure development projects such as highways  dams  harbors  hospitals  airports and industrial development as well as activity in the mining  forestry and other raw material based industries 
demand in the light construction equipment market is typically related to certain economic conditions such as the level of housing construction and other smaller scale developments and projects 
our products are primarily used in the medium heavy construction equipment markets 
purchasers of medium heavy construction equipment include construction companies  municipalities  local governments  rental fleet owners  quarrying and mining companies and forestry related industries 
purchasers of light construction equipment include contractors  rental fleet owners  landscapers  logistics companies and farmers 

table of contents military equipment market we supply products for heavy and medium payload tactical trucks that are used by various military customers 
sales and production of these vehicles can be influenced by overall defense spending both by the us government and foreign governments and the presence of military conflicts and potential military conflicts throughout the world 
demand for these vehicles is expected to increase as the result of the continuing conflict in the middle east 
in addition  demand has increased for remanufacturing and replacement of the large fleet of vehicles that have served in the middle east due to over use and new armor and technology requirements 
commercial vehicle industry trends our performance and growth are directly related to trends in the commercial vehicle market that are focused on driver retention  comfort and safety 
these commercial vehicle industry trends include the following system sourcing 
commercial vehicle oems are seeking suppliers capable of providing fully engineered  complete systems rather than suppliers who produce the separate parts that comprise a system 
by outsourcing complete systems  oems are able to reduce the costs associated with the design and integration of different components and improve quality by requiring their suppliers to assemble and test major portions of the vehicle prior to beginning production 
in addition  oems are able to develop more efficient assembly processes when complete systems are delivered in sequence rather than as individual parts or components 
globalization of suppliers 
to serve multiple markets more cost effectively  commercial vehicle oems are beginning to standardize global vehicle platforms to be manufactured and sold in various geographic markets around the world 
having operations in the geographic markets in which oems produce their global platforms enables suppliers to meet oems needs more economically and more efficiently 
shift of design and engineering to suppliers 
oems are focusing their efforts on brand development and overall vehicle design  instead of the design of individual vehicle systems 
oems are increasingly looking to their suppliers to provide suggestions for new products  designs  engineering developments and manufacturing processes 
as a result  strategic suppliers are gaining increased access to confidential planning information regarding oems future vehicle designs and manufacturing processes 
systems and modules increase the importance of strategic suppliers because they generally increase the percentage of vehicle content 
broad manufacturing capabilities 
with respect to commercial vehicle interiors  oems are requiring their suppliers to manufacture interior systems and products utilizing alternative materials and processes in order to meet oems demand for customized styling or cost requirements 
in addition  while oems seek to differentiate their vehicles through the introduction of innovative interior features  suppliers are proactively developing new interior products with enhanced features 
ongoing supplier consolidation 
we believe the worldwide commercial vehicle supply industry is continuing to consolidate as suppliers seek to achieve operating synergies through business combinations  shift production to locations with more flexible work rules and practices  acquire complementary technologies  build stronger customer relationships and follow their oem customers as they expand globally 
suppliers need to provide oems with single point sourcing of integrated systems and modules on a global basis  and this is expected to drive further industry consolidation 
furthermore  the cost focus of most major oems has forced suppliers to reduce costs and improve productivity on an ongoing basis  including economies of scale through consolidation 
competitive strengths we believe that our competitive strengths include  but are not limited to  the following leading market positions and brands 
we believe that we are the leading supplier of seating systems and soft interior trim products  the only non captive manufacturer of class truck body systems which includes cab body assemblies for the north american commercial vehicle heavy truck market and one of the largest global suppliers of construction vehicle seating systems

as a result  we believe we are well positioned to improve our operating margins and capitalize on any volume increases with minimal additional capital expenditures 
grow sales to the aftermarket 
while commercial vehicles have a relatively long life  certain components  such as seats  wipers and mirrors  are replaced more frequently 
we believe that there are opportunities to leverage our brand recognition to increase our sales to the replacement aftermarket 
since many aftermarket participants are small and locally focused  we plan to leverage our national presence to increase our market share in the fragmented aftermarket 
we believe that the continued growth in the aftermarket represents an attractive opportunity to diversify our business due to its relative stability as well as the market penetration opportunity 
pursue strategic acquisitions and continue to diversify revenues 
we will selectively pursue complementary strategic acquisitions that allow us to leverage the marketing  engineering and manufacturing strengths of our business and expand our revenues to new and existing customers 
the markets in which we operate are fragmented and provide for consolidation opportunities

our interior systems process capabilities include injection molding  low pressure injection molding  urethane molding and foaming processes  compression molding  heavy gauge thermoforming and vacuum forming as well as various cutting  sewing  trimming and finishing methods 

table of contents mirrors  wipers and controls 
we manufacture our mirrors  wipers and controls utilizing a variety of manufacturing processes and techniques 
our mirrors  wipers and controls are primarily hand assembled  tested and packaged 
cab structures  sleeper boxes  body panels and structural components 
we utilize a wide range of manufacturing processes to produce the majority of the steel and aluminum stampings used in our cab structures  sleeper boxes  body panels and structural components and a variety of both robotic and manual welding techniques in the assembly of these products 
in addition  both our norwalk  ohio and kings mountain  north carolina facilities have large capacity  fully automated e coat paint priming systems allowing us to provide our customers with a paint ready cab product 
due to their high cost  full body e coat systems  such as ours  are rarely found outside of the manufacturing operations of the major oems 
the major large press lines at our shadyside  ohio facility provide us with the in house manufacturing flexibility for both aluminum and steel stampings delivered just in time to our cab assembly plants 
this plant also provides us with low volume forming and processing techniques including laser trim operations that minimize investment and time to manufacture for low volume applications 
electronic wire harnesses and panel assemblies 
we utilize several manufacturing techniques to produce the majority of our electronic wire harnesses and panel assemblies 
our processes  both manual and automated  are designed to produce complex  low to medium volume wire harnesses and panel assemblies in short time frames 
our wire harnesses and panel assemblies are both electronically and hand tested 
we have a broad array of processes to offer our commercial vehicle oem customers to enable us to meet their styling and cost requirements 
the vehicle cab is the most significant and appealing aspect to the driver of the vehicle  and consequently each commercial vehicle oem has unique requirements as to feel  appearance and features 
the end markets for our products are highly specialized and our customers frequently request modified products in low volumes within an expedited delivery timeframe 
as a result  we primarily utilize flexible manufacturing cells at the vast majority of our production facilities 
manufacturing cells are clusters of individual manufacturing operations and work stations grouped in a circular configuration  with the operators placed centrally within the configuration 
this provides flexibility by allowing efficient changes to the number of operations each operator performs 
when compared to the more traditional  less flexible assembly line process  cell manufacturing allows us to maintain our product output consistent with our oem customers requirements and reduce the level of inventory 
when an end user buys a commercial vehicle  the end user will specify the seat and other features for that vehicle 
because each of our seating systems is unique  our manufacturing facilities have significant complexity which we manage by building in sequence 
we build our seating systems as orders are received  and systems are delivered to the customer s rack in the sequence in which vehicles come down the assembly line 
we have systems in place that allow us to provide complete customized interior kits in boxes that are delivered in sequence  and we intend to expand upon these systems such that we will be able to provide  in sequence  fully integrated modular systems combining the cab body and interior and seating systems 
in many instances  we keep track of our build sequence by vehicle identification number and components are identified by bar code 
sequencing reduces our cost of production because it eliminates warehousing costs and reduces waste and obsolescence  offsetting any increased labor costs 
several of our manufacturing facilities are strategically located near our customers assembly plants  which facilitates this process and minimizes shipping costs 
we employ just in time manufacturing and system sourcing in our operations to meet customer requirements for faster deliveries and to minimize our need to carry significant inventory levels 
we utilize material systems to manage inventory levels and  in certain locations  we have inventory delivered as often as two times per day from a nearby facility based on the previous day s order 
this eliminates the need to carry excess inventory at our facilities 
typically  in a strong economy  new vehicle production increases and greater funding is available to be spent on enhancements to the truck interior 
as demand goes up  the mix of our products shifts towards more expensive systems  such as sleeper units  with enhanced features and higher quality materials 
the shift from low end units to 
table of contents high end units amplifies the positive effect a strong economy has on our business 
conversely  when economic conditions and indicators decline and customers shift away from ordering high end units with enhanced features  our business is adversely affected from both lower volume and lower pricing 
we strive to manage down cycles by running our facilities at capacity while maintaining the capability and flexibility to expand 
we have plans to work with our employees and rely on their involvement to help minimize problems and re align our capacity during fluctuating periods of increased or decreased production levels to achieve on time delivery 
as a means to enhance our operations  we continue to implement tqps throughout our operations 
tqps is our customized version of lean manufacturing and consists of a hour interactive class that is taught exclusively by members of our management team 
a significant portion of the labor efficiencies we gained over the past few years is due to the program 
tqps is an analytical process in which we analyze each of our manufacturing cells and identify the most efficient process to improve efficiency and quality 
the goal is to achieve total cost management and continuous improvement 
some examples of tqps related improvements are reduced labor to move parts around the facility  clear walking paths in and around manufacturing cells and increased safety 
an ongoing goal is to reduce the time employees spend waiting for materials within a facility 
in an effort to increase operational efficiency  improve product quality and provide additional capacity  we intend to continue to implement tqps improvements at each of our manufacturing facilities 
raw materials and suppliers a description of the principal raw materials we utilize for each of our principal product categories is set forth below seats and seating systems 
the principal raw materials used in our seat systems include steel  aluminum and foam related products and are generally readily available and obtained from multiple suppliers under various supply agreements 
leather  vinyl  fabric and certain components are also purchased from multiple suppliers under supply agreements 
typically  our supply agreements are for a term of at least one year and are terminable by us for breach or convenience 
trim systems and components 
the principal raw materials used in our interior systems processes are resin and chemical products  foam  vinyl and fabric which are formed and assembled into end products 
these raw materials are obtained from multiple suppliers  typically under supply agreements which are for a term of at least one year and are terminable by us for breach or convenience 
mirrors  wipers and controls 
the principal raw materials used to manufacture our mirrors  wipers and controls are steel  stainless steel and rubber  which are generally readily available and obtained from multiple suppliers 
we also purchase sub assembled products such as motors for our wiper systems and mirrors 
cab structures  sleeper boxes  body panels and structural components 
the principal raw materials used in our cab structures  sleeper boxes  body panels and structural components are steel and aluminum  the majority of which we purchase in sheets and stamp at our shadyside  ohio facility 
these raw materials are generally readily available and obtained from several suppliers  typically under purchase contracts which fix price and supply for up to one year 
electronic wire harnesses and panel assemblies 
the principal raw materials used to manufacture our electronic wire harnesses are wire  connectors  terminals  switches  relays and braid fabric 
these raw materials are obtained from multiple suppliers and are generally readily available 
our supply agreements generally provide for fixed pricing but do not require us to purchase any specified quantities 
we have not experienced any significant shortages of raw materials and normally do not carry inventories of raw materials or finished products in excess of those reasonably required to meet production and shipping schedules as well as service requirements 
steel  aluminum  petroleum based products  copper  resin  foam  fabrics  wire and wire components account for the most significant portion of our raw material costs 
we typically purchase steel  copper and petroleum based products at market prices  which over the last several years  have increased significantly 
as a result  we are currently being assessed surcharges and price increases on certain of our purchases of steel  copper and petroleum related products 
we continue to work with our customers and 
table of contents suppliers to minimize the impact of such surcharges while working diligently to minimize the impacts of such increases 
certain component purchases and suppliers are directed by our customers 
we do not believe we are dependent on a single supplier or limited group of suppliers for our raw materials 
customers and marketing we sell our products principally to the commercial vehicle oem truck market 
approximately of our revenues and approximately of our revenues were derived from sales to commercial vehicle truck oems  with the remainder of our revenues being generated principally from sales to the construction  aftermarket and oem service markets 
we supply our products primarily to the heavy truck oem market  construction market  the aftermarket and oem service segment and other commercial vehicle and specialty markets 
the following is a summary of our revenues by end user market for the three years ended december heavy truck oem construction aftermarket and oem service military bus agriculture other total the change in revenues by end market in is primarily related to the decreased demand in the north american class heavy truck market 
our principal customers in north america include paccar  international  caterpillar  freightliner and volvo mack 
we believe we are an important long term supplier to all leading truck manufacturers in north america because of our comprehensive product offerings  leading brand names and product innovation 
in our european  china and australian operations  our principal customers in the commercial vehicle market include caterpillar  volvo mack  komatsu  hitachi  cnh global case new holland and jcb limited 
the following is a summary of our significant revenues by oem customer for the three years ended december paccar international caterpillar freightliner volvo mack oshkosh truck komatsu deere co 
other total except as set forth in the above table  no other customer accounted for more than of our revenues for the three years ended december  the change in revenues by significant oem customers in is primarily related to the decreased demand in the north american class heavy truck market 

table of contents our european  china  australian and mexican operations collectively contributed approximately  and of our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the change in revenue by geographic location in is primarily related to the decreased demand in the north american class heavy truck market as well as the impact of the cieb and pekm acquisitions 
our oem customers generally source business to us pursuant to written contracts  purchase orders or other firm commitments in terms of price  quality  technology and delivery 
awarded business generally covers the supply of all or a portion of a customer s production and service requirements for a particular product program rather than the supply of a specific quantity of products 
in general  these contracts  purchase orders and commitments provide that the customer can terminate the contract  purchase order or commitment if we do not meet specified quality  delivery and cost requirements 
such contracts  purchase orders or other firm commitments generally extend for the entire life of a platform  which is typically five to seven years 
although these contracts  purchase orders or other commitments may be terminated at any time by our customers but not by us  such terminations have been minimal and have not had a material impact on our results of operations 
in order to reduce our reliance on any one vehicle model  we produce products for a broad cross section of both new and more established models 
our contracts with our major oem customers generally provide for an annual productivity cost reduction 
these reductions are calculated on an annual basis as a percentage of the previous year s purchases by each customer 
the reduction is achieved through engineering changes  material cost reductions  logistics savings  reductions in packaging cost and labor efficiencies 
historically  most of these cost reductions have been offset by both internal reductions and through the assistance of our supply base  although no assurances can be given that we will be able to achieve such reductions in the future 
if the annual reduction targets are not achieved  the difference is recovered through price reductions 
our cost structure is comprised of a high percentage of variable costs that provides us with additional flexibility during economic cycles 
our sales and marketing efforts with respect to our oem sales are designed to create overall awareness of our engineering  design and manufacturing capabilities and to enable us to be selected to supply products for new and redesigned models by our oem customers 
our sales and marketing staff works closely with our design and engineering personnel to prepare the materials used for bidding on new business as well as to provide a consistent interface between us and our key customers 
we currently have sales and marketing personnel located in every major region in which we operate 
from time to time  we also participate in industry trade shows and advertise in industry publications 
one of our ongoing initiatives is to negotiate and enter into long term supply agreements with our existing customers that allow us to leverage all of our business and provide a complete cab system to our commercial vehicle oem customers 
our principal customers for our aftermarket sales include oem dealers and independent wholesale distributors 
our sales and marketing efforts for our aftermarket sales are focused on support of these two distribution chains  as well as direct contact with all major fleets 
backlog we do not generally obtain long term  firm purchase orders from our customers 
rather  our customers typically place annual blanket purchase orders  but these orders do not obligate them to purchase any specific or minimum amount of products from us until a release is issued by the customer under the blanket purchase order 
releases are typically placed within to days of required delivery and may be canceled at any time  in which case the customer would be liable for work in process and finished goods 
we do not believe that our backlog of expected product sales covered by firm purchase orders is a meaningful indicator of future sales since orders may be rescheduled or canceled 
competition within each of our principal product categories  we compete with a variety of independent suppliers and with oems in house operations  primarily on the basis of price  breadth of product offerings  product quality  technical expertise  development capability  product delivery and product service 
we believe we are the only supplier in the north american commercial vehicle market that can offer complete cab systems in sequence integrating interior 
table of contents systems including seats  interior trim and flooring systems  mirrors and wire harnesses with the cab structure 
a summary of our estimated market position and primary independent competitors is set forth below seats and seating systems 
we believe that we have the number one market position in north america supplying seats and seating systems to the commercial vehicle heavy truck market 
we also believe that we have the number one market position in supplying seats and seating systems to commercial vehicles used in the medium heavy construction equipment industry on a worldwide basis 
our primary independent competitors in the north american commercial vehicle market include sears manufacturing company  accuride corporation  grammer ag and seats  inc  and our primary competitors in the european commercial vehicle market include grammer ag and isringhausen 
trim systems and components 
we believe that we have the number one market position in the north american commercial vehicle heavy truck market with respect to our soft interior trim products and a leading presence in the hard interior trim market 
we face competition from a number of different competitors with respect to each of our trim system products and components 
overall  our primary independent competitors are conmet  fabriform  tpi  findlay  superior  trim masters  inc  blachford ltd 
and mitras 
mirrors  wipers and controls 
we believe that we are a leading supplier in the north american commercial vehicle heavy truck market with respect to our windshield wiper systems and mirrors 
we face competition from a number of different competitors with respect to each of our principal products in this category 
our principal competitors for mirrors are hadley  lang mekra and trucklite  and our principal competitors for windshield wiper systems are johnson electric  trico and valeo 
cab structures  sleeper boxes  body panels and structural components 
we believe we are the leading non captive supplier in the north american commercial vehicle heavy truck market with respect to our cab structural components  cab structures  sleeper boxes and body panels 
our principal competitors are magna  ogihara corporation  spartanburg stamping  able body and defiance metal products 
electronic wire harnesses and panel assemblies 
we believe that we are a leading supplier of low to medium volume complex  electronic wire harnesses and related assemblies used in the global heavy equipment  commercial vehicle  heavy truck and specialty and military vehicle markets 
our principal competitors for electronic wire harnesses include large diversified suppliers such as afl  delphi  leoni  nexans  pkc  stoneridge  yazaki and smaller independent companies such as fargo assembly and unlimited services 
research and development  design and engineering our objective is to be a leader in offering superior quality and technologically advanced products to our customers at competitive prices 
we engage in ongoing engineering and research and development activities to improve the reliability  performance and cost effectiveness of our existing products and to design and develop new products for existing and new applications 
we generally work with our customers engineering and development teams at the beginning of the design process for new components and assemblies  or the redesign process for existing components and assemblies  in order to maximize production efficiency and quality 
these processes may take place from one to three years prior to the commencement of production 
on average  the development time for a new component takes between and months during the design phase  while the re engineering of an existing part may take between one and six months 
early design involvement can result in a product that meets or exceeds the customer s design and performance requirements and is more efficient to manufacture 
in addition  our extensive involvement enhances our position for bidding on such business 
we work aggressively to ensure that our quality and delivery metrics distinguish us from our competitors 
we focus on bringing our customers integrated products that have superior content  comfort and safety 
consistent with our value added engineering focus  we place a large emphasis on the relationships with the engineering departments of our customers 
these relationships not only help us to identify new business 
table of contents opportunities but also enable us to compete based on the quality of our products and services  rather than exclusively on price 
we are currently involved in the design stage of several products for our customers and expect to begin production of these products in the years to intellectual property we consider ourselves to be a leader in both product and process technology  and  therefore  protection of intellectual property is important to our business 
our principal intellectual property consists of product and process technology  a limited number of united states and foreign patents  trade secrets  trademarks and copyrights 
although our intellectual property is important to our business operations and in the aggregate constitutes a valuable asset  we do not believe that any single patent  trade secret  trademark or copyright  or group of patents  trade secrets  trademarks or copyrights is critical to the success of our business 
our policy is to seek statutory protection for all significant intellectual property embodied in patents  trademarks and copyrights 
from time to time  we grant licenses under our patents and technology and receive licenses under patents and technology of others 
we market our products under brand names that include kab seating  national seating  trim systems and sprague controls  sprague devices  prutsman tm  moto mirror  roadwatch  and mayflower 
we believe that our brands are valuable and are increasing in value with the growth of our business  but that our business is not dependent on such brands 
we own us federal trademark registrations for several of our brands 
seasonality oems production requirements can fluctuate as the demand for new vehicles soften during the holiday seasons in north america  europe and asia as oem manufacturers generally close their production facilities at various times during the year 
employees as of december   we had approximately  permanent employees  of which approximately were salaried and the remainder were hourly 
approximately of the employees in our north american operations were unionized  and approximately of our employees at our europe and asia operations were represented by shop steward committees 
we have not experienced any material strikes  lockouts or work stoppages during and consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory 
on an as needed basis during peak periods  contract and temporary employees are utilized

item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 

table of contents if any of these certain risks and uncertainties were to actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following volatility and cyclicality in the commercial vehicle market could adversely affect us 
our profitability depends in part on the varying conditions in the commercial vehicle market 
this market is subject to considerable volatility as it moves in response to cycles in the overall business environment and is particularly sensitive to the industrial sector  which generates a significant portion of the freight tonnage hauled 
sales of commercial vehicles have historically been cyclical  with demand affected by such economic factors as industrial production  construction levels  demand for consumer durable goods  interest rates and fuel costs 
for example  north american commercial vehicle sales and production experienced a downturn from to due to a confluence of events that included a weak economy  an oversupply of new and used vehicle inventory and lower spending on commercial vehicles and equipment 
in addition  north american commercial vehicle sales and production experienced a downturn during as a result of pre orders in and general weakness in the north american economy and corresponding decline in the need for commercial vehicles to haul freight tonnage in north america  among other factors 
these downturns had a material adverse effect on our business during the same periods 
we cannot provide any assurance as to the length or ultimate level of the recovery of this decline 
we expect that unit production of class heavy trucks will not materially recover from levels in nor can we predict that the industry will follow past cyclical patterns that might include a strong pre order in advance of new emissions standards set to take place in our profitability could be adversely affected if the actual production volumes for our customers vehicles are significantly lower than expected 
we incur costs and make capital expenditures based upon estimates of production volumes for our customers vehicles 
while we attempt to establish a price for our components and systems that will compensate for variances in production volumes  if the actual production of these vehicles is significantly less than anticipated  our gross margin on these products would be adversely affected 
we enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given platform s life to supply products for that platform 
once we enter into such agreements  fulfillment of our purchasing requirements is our obligation for the entire production life of the platform  with terms ranging from five to seven years  and we have no provisions to terminate such contracts 
we may become committed to supply products to our customers at selling prices that are not sufficient to cover the direct cost to produce such products 
we cannot predict our customers demands for our products either in the aggregate or for particular reporting periods 
if customers representing a significant amount of our revenues were to purchase materially lower volumes than expected  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our major oem customers may exert significant influence over us 
the commercial vehicle component supply industry has traditionally been highly fragmented and serves a limited number of large oems 
as a result  oems have historically had a significant amount of leverage over their outside suppliers 
our contracts with major oem customers generally provide for an annual productivity cost reduction 
historically  cost reductions through product design changes  increased productivity and similar programs with our suppliers have generally offset these customer imposed productivity cost reduction requirements 
however  if we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset price reductions  our gross margin and profitability would be adversely affected 
in addition  changes in oems purchasing policies or payment practices could have an adverse effect on our business 
we may be unable to successfully implement our business strategy and  as a result  our businesses and financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our ability to achieve our business and financial objectives is subject to a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
for example  we may not be successful in implementing our strategy if unforeseen factors 
table of contents emerge that diminish the expected growth in the commercial vehicle markets we supply  or we experience increased pressure on our margins 
in addition  we may not succeed in integrating strategic acquisitions and our pursuit of additional strategic acquisitions may lead to resource constraints which could have a negative impact on our ability to meet customers demands  thereby adversely affecting our relationships with those customers 
as a result of such business or competitive factors  we may decide to alter or discontinue aspects of our business strategy and may adopt alternative or additional strategies 
any failure to successfully implement our business strategy could adversely affect our business  results of operations and growth potential 
developing product innovations has been and will continue to be a significant part of our business strategy 
we believe that it is important that we continue to meet our customers demands for product innovation  improvement and enhancement  including the continued development of new generation products  design improvements and innovations that improve the quality and efficiency of our products 
however  such development will require us to continue to invest in research and development and sales and marketing 
in the future  we may not have sufficient resources to make such necessary investments  or we may be unable to make the technological advances necessary to carry out product innovations sufficient to meet our customers demands 
we are also subject to the risks generally associated with product development  including lack of market acceptance  delays in product development and failure of products to operate properly 
we may  as a result of these factors  be unable to meaningfully focus on product innovation as a strategy and may therefore be unable to meet our customers demands for product innovation 
if we are unable to obtain raw materials at favorable prices  it could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
numerous raw materials are used in the manufacture of our products 
steel  aluminum  petroleum based products  copper  resin  foam  fabrics  wire and wire components account for the most significant portion of our raw material costs 
although we currently maintain alternative sources for raw materials  our business is subject to the risk of price increases and periodic delays in delivery 
for example  we are currently being assessed surcharges as well as price increases on certain purchases of steel  copper and other raw materials 
if we are unable to purchase certain raw materials required for our operations for a significant period of time  our operations would be disrupted  and our results of operations would be adversely affected 
in addition  if we are unable to pass on the increased costs of raw materials to our customers  this could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may be unable to complete additional strategic acquisitions or we may encounter unforeseen difficulties in integrating acquisitions 
we intend to actively pursue additional acquisition targets that will allow us to continue to expand into new geographic markets  add new customers  provide new product  manufacturing and service capabilities and increase penetration with existing customers 
however  we expect to face competition for acquisition candidates  which may limit the number of our acquisition opportunities and may lead to higher acquisition prices 
moreover  acquisitions of businesses may require additional debt financing  resulting in additional leverage 
the covenants of our senior credit facility may further limit our ability to complete acquisitions 
there can be no assurance that we will find attractive acquisition candidates or successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing business 
if we fail to complete additional acquisitions  we may have difficulty competing with more thoroughly integrated competitors and our results of operations could be adversely affected 
to the extent that we do complete additional acquisitions  if the expected synergies from such acquisitions do not materialize or we fail to successfully integrate such new businesses into our existing businesses  our results of operations could also be adversely affected 
we may be adversely impacted by labor strikes  work stoppages and other matters 
the hourly workforces at our norwalk and shadyside  ohio facilities and mexico operations are unionized 
the unionized employees at these facilities represented approximately of our employees in our north american operations as of december  we have experienced limited unionization efforts at certain of our other north american facilities from time to time 
in addition  of our employees at our europe and asia operations are represented by a shop steward committee  which may seek to limit our flexibility in our relationship 
table of contents with these employees 
we cannot assure you that we will not encounter future unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees 
many of our oem customers and their suppliers also have unionized work forces 
work stoppages or slow downs experienced by oems or their other suppliers could result in slow downs or closures of assembly plants where our products are included in assembled commercial vehicles 
in the event that one or more of our customers or their suppliers experience a material work stoppage  such work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our businesses are subject to statutory environmental and safety regulations in multiple jurisdictions  and the impact of any changes in regulation and or the violation of any applicable laws and regulations by our businesses could result in a material and adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to foreign  federal  state  and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment and occupational health and safety  including laws regulating air emissions  wastewater discharges  the generation  storage  handling  use and transportation of hazardous materials  the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the soil  ground or air  and the health and safety of our colleagues 
we are also required to obtain permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations 
we cannot assure you that we are  or have been  in complete compliance with such environment and safety laws  regulations and permits 
if we violate or fail to comply with these laws  regulations or permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators 
in some instances  such a fine or sanction could have a material adverse effect on us 
the environmental laws to which we are subject have become more stringent over time  and we could incur material expenses in the future to comply with environmental laws 
we are also subject to laws imposing liability for the cleanup of contaminated property 
under these laws  we could be held liable for costs and damages relating to contamination at our past or present facilities and at third party sites to which we sent waste containing hazardous substances 
the amount of such liability could be material 
several of our facilities are either certified as  or are in the process of being certified as iso   or ts the international environmental management standard compliant or are developing similar environmental management systems 
although we have made  and will continue to make  capital expenditures to implement such environmental programs and comply with environmental requirements  we do not expect to make material capital expenditures for environmental controls in the environmental laws to which we are subject have become more stringent over time  however  and we could incur material costs or expenses in the future to comply with environmental laws 
certain of our operations generate hazardous substances and wastes 
if a release of such substances or wastes occurs at or from our properties  or at or from any offsite disposal location to which substances or wastes from our current or former operations were taken  or if contamination is discovered at any of our current or former properties  we may be held liable for the costs of cleanup and for any other response by governmental authorities or private parties  together with any associated fines  penalties or damages 
in most jurisdictions  this liability would arise whether or not we had complied with environmental laws governing the handling of hazardous substances or wastes 
we may be adversely affected by the impact of government regulations on our oem customers 
although the products we manufacture and supply to commercial vehicle oems are not subject to significant government regulation  our business is indirectly impacted by the extensive governmental regulation applicable to commercial vehicle oems 
these regulations primarily relate to emissions and noise standards imposed by the environmental protection agency epa  state regulatory agencies  such as the california air resources board carb  and other regulatory agencies around the world 
commercial vehicle oems are also subject to the national traffic and motor vehicle safety act and federal motor vehicle safety standards promulgated by the national highway traffic safety administration 
changes in emission standards and other proposed governmental regulations could impact the demand for commercial vehicles and  as a result  indirectly impact our operations 
for example  new emission standards governing heavy duty class diesel engines that went into effect in the united states on october  and january  resulted in significant purchases of new trucks by fleet operators 
table of contents prior to such date and reduced short term demand for such trucks in periods immediately following such date 
new emission standards for truck engines used in class to trucks imposed by the epa and carb are scheduled to become effective in to the extent that current or future governmental regulation has a negative impact on the demand for commercial vehicles  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
our customer base is concentrated and the loss of business from a major customer or the discontinuation of particular commercial vehicle platforms could reduce our revenues 
sales to paccar  international  caterpillar  freightliner and volvo mack accounted for approximately    and  respectively  of our revenue in  and our ten largest customers accounted for approximately of our revenue in the loss of any of our largest customers or the loss of significant business from any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even though we may be selected as the supplier of a product by an oem for a particular vehicle  our oem customers issue blanket purchase orders which generally provide for the supply of that customer s annual requirements for that vehicle  rather than for a specific number of our products 
if the oem s requirements are less than estimated  the number of products we sell to that oem will be accordingly reduced 
in addition  the oem may terminate its purchase orders with us at any time 
currency exchange rate fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
we have operations in europe  china  australia and mexico  which accounted for approximately of our revenues in as a result  we generate a significant portion of our sales and incur a significant portion of our expenses in currencies other than the us dollar 
to the extent that we are unable to match revenues received in foreign currencies with costs paid in the same currency  exchange rate fluctuations in any such currency could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
we are subject to certain risks associated with our foreign operations 
we have operations in europe  china  australia and mexico  which accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
there are certain risks inherent in our international business activities including  but not limited to the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems  foreign customers  who may have longer payment cycles than customers in the united states  tax rates in certain foreign countries  which may exceed those in the united states and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other restrictions  including restrictions on repatriation  intellectual property protection difficulties  general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate  which may have an adverse effect on our operations in those countries  the difficulties associated with managing a large organization spread throughout various countries  and complications in complying with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  which may conflict with united states law 
as we continue to expand our business globally  our success will be dependent  in part  on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with foreign operations 
we cannot assure you that these and other factors will not have a material adverse effect on our international operations or our business  financial condition or results of operations as a whole 

table of contents our inability to compete effectively in the highly competitive commercial vehicle component supply industry could result in lower prices for our products  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
the commercial vehicle component supply industry is highly competitive 
our products primarily compete on the basis of price  breadth of product offerings  product quality  technical expertise and development capability  product delivery and product service 
increased competition may lead to price reductions resulting in reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
current and future competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others  foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do  develop products that are superior to our products  produce similar products at lower cost than we can or adapt more quickly to new technologies  industry or customer requirements 
by doing so  they may enhance their ability to meet the needs of our customers or potential future customers 
these developments could limit our ability to obtain revenues from new customers and to maintain existing revenues from our customer base 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors and the failure to do so may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our products may be rendered less attractive by changes in competitive technologies 
changes in competitive technologies may render certain of our products less attractive 
our ability to anticipate changes in technology and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to remain competitive 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for us to remain competitive 
we are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications  including lack of market acceptance  delays in product development and failure to operate properly 
if we are unable to recruit or retain skilled personnel  or if we lose the services of any of our key management personnel  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract  train  integrate and retain highly skilled personnel 
competition for these employees is intense 
we may not be able to retain our current key employees or attract  train  integrate or retain other highly skilled personnel in the future 
our future success also depends in large part on the continued service of key management personnel  particularly our key executive officers 
if we lose the services of one or more of these individuals or other key personnel  or if we are unable to attract  train  integrate and retain the highly skilled personnel we need  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we have only limited protection for our proprietary rights in our intellectual property  which makes it difficult to prevent third parties from infringing upon our rights 
our success depends to a certain degree on our ability to protect our intellectual property and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
while we have been issued patents and have registered trademarks with respect to many of our products  our competitors could independently develop similar or superior products or technologies  duplicate our designs  trademarks  processes or other intellectual property or design around any processes or designs on which we have or may obtain patents or trademark protection 
in addition  it is possible that third parties may have or acquire licenses for other technology or designs that we may use or desire to use  so that we may need to acquire licenses to  or to contest the validity of  such patents or trademarks of third parties 
such licenses may not be made available to us on acceptable terms  if at all  and we may not prevail in contesting the validity of third party rights 
in addition to patent and trademark protection  we also protect trade secrets  know how and other confidential information against unauthorized use by others or disclosure by persons who have access to them  such as our employees  through contractual arrangements 
these arrangements may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or 
table of contents disclosure of such trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our technologies  our revenues could be materially adversely affected 
our products may be susceptible to claims by third parties that our products infringe upon their proprietary rights 
as the number of products in our target markets increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  we may become increasingly subject to claims by a third party that our technology infringes such party s proprietary rights 
regardless of their merit  any such claims could be time consuming and expensive to defend  may divert management s attention and resources  could cause product shipment delays and could require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements 
if successful  a claim of infringement against us and our inability to license the infringed or similar technology and or product could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the market price of our common stock may be extremely volatile 
our stock price has fluctuated since our initial public offering in august the trading price of our common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations  the gain or loss of significant orders  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the commercial vehicle industry and other events or factors 
in addition  the equity markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar or related to that of ours and which have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these market fluctuations may have affected and may continue to affect the market price of our common stock 
our operating results  revenues and expenses may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
for a number of reasons  including but not limited to  those described below  our operating results  revenues and expenses have in the past varied and may in the future vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year 
these fluctuations could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
fluctuations in quarterly or annual operating results 
our operating results may fluctuate as a result of the size  timing  volume and execution of significant orders and shipments  changes in the terms of our sales contracts  the timing of new product announcements  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  market acceptance of new and enhanced products  the length of our sales cycles  changes in our operating expenses  personnel changes  new business acquisitions  changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and seasonal factors 
limited ability to adjust expenses 
we base our operating expense budgets primarily on expected revenue trends 
certain of our expenses are relatively fixed and as such we may be unable to adjust expenses quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall 
accordingly  any shortfall in revenue may cause significant variation in operating results in any quarter or year 

table of contents based on the above factors  we believe that quarter to quarter or year to year comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that in one or more future quarters or years  our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
we may be subject to product liability claims  recalls or warranty claims  which could be expensive  damage our reputation and result in a diversion of management resources 
as a supplier of products and systems to commercial vehicle oems  we face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products  or the equipment into which our products are incorporated  malfunction and result in personal injury or death 
product liability claims could result in significant losses as a result of expenses incurred in defending claims or the award of damages 
in addition  we may be required to participate in recalls involving systems or components sold by us if any prove to be defective  or we may voluntarily initiate a recall or make payments related to such claims as a result of various industry or business practices or the need to maintain good customer relationships 
such a recall would result in a diversion of management resources 
while we do maintain product liability insurance  we cannot assure you that it will be sufficient to cover all product liability claims  that such claims will not exceed our insurance coverage limits or that such insurance will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
any product liability claim brought against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
moreover  we warrant the workmanship and materials of many of our products under limited warranties and have entered into warranty agreements with certain oems that warranty certain of our products in the hands of these oems customers  in some cases for as long as six years 
accordingly  we are subject to risk of warranty claims in the event that our products do not conform to our customers specifications or  in some cases in the event that our products do not conform with their customers expectations 
it is possible for warranty claims to result in costly product recalls  significant repair costs and damage to our reputation  all of which would adversely affect our results of operations 
equipment failures  delays in deliveries or catastrophic loss at any of our facilities could lead to production or service curtailments or shutdowns 
we manufacture or assemble our products at facilities in north america  europe  china and australia 
an interruption in production or service capabilities at any of these facilities as a result of equipment failure or other reasons could result in our inability to produce our products  which could reduce our net revenues and earnings for the affected period 
in the event of a stoppage in production at any of our facilities  even if only temporary  or if we experience delays as a result of events that are beyond our control  delivery times to our customers could be severely affected 
any significant delay in deliveries to our customers could lead to increased returns or cancellations and cause us to lose future revenues 
our facilities are also subject to the risk of catastrophic loss due to unanticipated events such as fires  explosions or violent weather conditions 
we may experience plant shutdowns or periods of reduced production as a result of equipment failure  delays in deliveries or catastrophic loss  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and make it more difficult to implement our business strategy 
the aggregate amount of our outstanding indebtedness was million as of december  our substantial level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay  when due  the principal of  interest on or other amounts due in respect of our indebtedness  including the notes 
our substantial indebtedness  combined with our lease and other financial obligations and contractual commitments could have other important consequences to you as a shareholder 
for example  it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness  including the notes  and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments  including financial and other restrictive covenants  could result in an event of default under the indenture governing the notes and the agreements governing such other indebtedness  
table of contents make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit our ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  execution of our business strategy or other purposes 
any of the above listed factors could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the terms of our senior credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes due may restrict our current and future operations  particularly our ability to respond to changes in our business or to take certain actions 
our senior credit facility and the indenture governing the senior notes due contain covenants that  among other things  restricts our ability to incur liens  incur or assume additional debt or guarantees or issue preferred stock  pay dividends  or make redemptions and repurchases  with respect to capital stock  prepay  or make redemptions and repurchases of  subordinated debt  make loans and investments  make capital expenditures  engage in mergers  acquisitions  asset sales  sale leaseback transactions and transactions with affiliates  change the business conducted by us or our subsidiaries  and amend the terms of subordinated debt 
also  our senior credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios and satisfy certain financial condition tests some of which become more restrictive over time 
if we do not comply with such covenants or satisfy such ratios  our lenders could declare an event of default under the senior credit facility  and our indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable 
our ability to comply with the provisions of the senior credit facility may be affected by changes in economic or business conditions beyond our control 
in addition  these covenants could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise 
our inability to successfully execute any planned cost reductions  restructuring initiatives or the achievement of operational efficiencies could result in the incurrence of additional costs and expenses that could adversely affect our reported earnings 
as part of our business strategy  we continuously seek ways to lower costs  improve manufacturing efficiencies and increase productivity and intend to apply this strategy to those operations acquired through acquisitions 
we may be unsuccessful in achieving these objectives which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we may incur restructuring charges in the future and such charges could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents our earnings may be adversely affected by changes to the carrying values of our tangible and intangible assets  including goodwill  as a result of recording any impairment charges deemed necessary in conjunction with the execution of our periodic asset impairment assessment and testing policy 
at december   we had goodwill of approximately million and other intangible assets of approximately million 
we may identify additional anticipated or unanticipated impairments in any of our tangible or intangible asset categories in future testing periods and be required to record charges against earnings in the period in which the impairment is identified 
specific indicators that give rise to asset impairment may include  but are not limited to  changes in the general economic environment  changes or downturns in our industry as a whole  termination of any of our customer contracts  restructuring efforts and general workforce reductions among other factors

adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure that is reconciled to net income  its most directly comparable gaap measure  in the accompanying financial tables 
adjusted ebitda is defined as net earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  gains losses on the early extinguishment of debt  restructuring charges  miscellaneous income expenses and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principle 
in calculating adjusted ebitda  we exclude the effects of gains losses on the early extinguishment of debt  restructuring charges  miscellaneous income expenses and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles because our management believes that some of these items may not occur in certain periods  the amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period and these items do not facilitate an understanding of our operating performance 
our management utilizes adjusted ebitda  in addition to the supplemental information  as an operating performance measure in conjunction with gaap measures  such as net income and gross margin calculated in conformity with gaap 
our management uses adjusted ebitda  in addition to the supplemental information  as an integral part of its reporting and planning processes and as one of the primary measures to  among other things i monitor and evaluate the performance of our business operations  ii facilitate management s internal comparisons of our historical operating performance of our business operations  iii facilitate management s external comparisons of the results of our overall business to the historical operating performance of other companies that may have different capital structures and debt levels  iv review and assess the operating performance of our management team and as a measure in evaluating employee compensation and bonuses  v analyze and evaluate financial and strategic planning decisions regarding future operating investments  and vi plan for and prepare future annual operating budgets and determine appropriate levels of operating investments 
our management believes that adjusted ebitda  in addition to the supplemental information  is useful to investors as it provides them with disclosures of our operating results on the same basis as that used by our management 
additionally  our management believes that adjusted ebitda  in addition to the supplemental information  provides useful information to investors about the performance of our overall business because the 
table of contents measure eliminates the effects of certain recurring and other unusual or infrequent charges that are not directly attributable to our underlying operating performance 
additionally  our management believes that because we have historically provided a non gaap financial measure in previous filings  that continuing to include a non gaap measure in our filings provides consistency in our financial reporting and continuity to investors for comparability purposes 
accordingly  we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda  when used in conjunction with the supplemental information and gaap financial measures  is a useful financial analysis tool  used by our management as described above  that can assist investors in assessing our financial condition  operating performance and underlying strength 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income prepared in conformity with gaap 
other companies may define adjusted ebitda differently

company overview we are a leading supplier of fully integrated system solutions for the global commercial vehicle market  including the heavy duty class truck market  the construction  military  bus and agriculture market and the specialty transportation markets 
as a result of our strong leadership in cab related products and systems  we are positioned to benefit from the increased focus of our customers on cab design and comfort and convenience features to better serve their end user  the driver 
our products include suspension seat systems  interior trim systems including instrument panels  door panels  headliners  cabinetry and floor systems  cab structures and components  mirrors  wiper systems  electronic wire harness assemblies and controls and switches specifically designed for applications in commercial vehicles 
we are differentiated from suppliers to the automotive industry by our ability to manufacture low volume customized products on a sequenced basis to meet the requirements of our customers 
we believe that we have the number one or two position in most of our major markets and that we are the only supplier in the north american commercial vehicle market that can offer complete cab systems including cab body assemblies  sleeper boxes  seats  interior trim  flooring  wire harnesses  panel assemblies and other structural components 
we believe our products are used by virtually every major north american heavy truck commercial vehicle oem  which we believe creates an opportunity to cross sell our products and offer a fully integrated system solution 
demand for our products is generally dependent on the number of new heavy truck commercial vehicles manufactured in north america  which in turn is a function of general economic conditions  interest rates  changes in governmental regulations  consumer spending  fuel costs and our customers inventory levels and production rates 
new heavy truck commercial vehicle demand has historically been cyclical and is particularly sensitive to the industrial sector of the economy  which generates a significant portion of the freight tonnage hauled by commercial vehicles 
production of heavy truck commercial vehicles in north america initially peaked in and experienced a downturn from to that was due to a weak economy  an oversupply of new and used vehicle inventory and lower spending on heavy truck commercial vehicles and equipment 
demand for commercial vehicles improved in due to broad economic recovery in north america  corresponding growth in the movement of goods  the growing need to replace aging truck fleets and oems received larger than expected pre orders in anticipation of the new epa emissions standards becoming effective in during  the demand for north american class heavy trucks experienced a downturn as a result of pre orders in and general weakness in the north american economy and corresponding decline in the need for commercial vehicles to haul freight tonnage in north america 
in  approximately of our revenue was generated from sales to north american heavy duty truck oems 
our remaining revenue in was primarily derived from sales to oems in the global construction market  the aftermarket  oem service organizations and other commercial vehicle and specialty markets 
demand for our products is also driven to a significant degree by preferences of the end user of the commercial vehicle  particularly with respect to heavy duty class trucks 
unlike the automotive industry  commercial vehicle oems generally afford the ultimate end user the ability to specify many of the component parts that will be used to manufacture the commercial vehicle  including a wide variety of cab interior styles and colors  the brand and type of seats  type of seat fabric and color and specific mirror styling 
in addition  certain of our products are only utilized in heavy duty class trucks  such as our storage systems  sleeper boxes  sleeper bunks and privacy curtains  and  as a result  changes in demand for heavy duty class trucks or the mix of options on a vehicle can have a greater impact on 
table of contents our business than changes in the overall demand for commercial vehicles 
to the extent that demand increases for higher content vehicles  our revenues and gross profit will be positively impacted 
demand for our products is also dependent on the overall vehicle demand for new commercial vehicles in the global construction equipment market and generally follows certain economic conditions around the world 
within the construction market  there are two classes of construction equipment  the medium heavy equipment market weighing over metric tons and the light construction equipment market weighing below metric tons 
demand in the medium heavy construction equipment market is typically related to the level of larger scale infrastructure development projects such as highways  dams  harbors  hospitals  airports and industrial development as well as activity in the mining  forestry and other raw material based industries 
demand in the light construction equipment market is typically related to certain economic conditions such as the level of housing construction and other smaller scale developments and projects 
our products are primarily used in the medium heavy construction equipment markets 
along with north america  we have operations in europe  china  australia and mexico 
our operating results are  therefore  impacted by exchange rate fluctuations to the extent we are unable to match revenues received in such currencies with costs incurred in such currencies 
strengthening of these foreign currencies as compared to the us dollar resulted in an approximate million increase in our revenues in as compared to and an approximate million increase in as compared to because our costs were generally impacted to the same degree as our revenue  this exchange rate fluctuation did not have a material impact on our net income in as compared to and compared to we continuously seek ways to improve our operating performance by lowering costs 
these efforts include  but are not limited to  the following sourcing efforts in europe and asia  consolidating our supply base to improve purchasing leverage  eliminating excess production capacity through the closure and consolidation of manufacturing or assembly facilities  and implementing lean manufacturing and total quality production system tqps initiatives to improve operating efficiency and product quality 
although oem demand for our products is directly correlated with new vehicle production  we also have the opportunity to grow through increasing our product content per vehicle through cross selling and bundling of products 
we generally compete for new business at the beginning of the development of a new vehicle platform and upon the redesign of existing programs 
new platform development generally begins at least one to three years before the marketing of such models by our customers 
contract durations for commercial vehicle products generally extend for the entire life of the platform  which is typically five to seven years 
in sourcing products for a specific platform  the customer generally develops a proposed production timetable  including current volume and option mix estimates based on their own assumptions  and then sources business with the supplier pursuant to written contracts  purchase orders or other firm commitments in terms of price  quality  technology and delivery 
in general  these contracts  purchase orders and commitments provide that the customer can terminate if a supplier does not meet specified quality and delivery requirements and  in many cases  they provide that the price will decrease over the proposed production timetable 
awarded business generally covers the supply of all or a portion of a customer s production and service requirements for a particular product program rather than the supply of a specific quantity of products 
accordingly  in estimating awarded business over the life of a contract or other commitment  a supplier must make various assumptions as to the estimated number of vehicles expected to be produced  the timing of that production  mix of options on the vehicles produced and pricing of the products being supplied 
the actual production volumes and option mix of vehicles produced by customers depend on a number of factors that are beyond a supplier s control 

table of contents recent acquisitions in october  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of pekm kabeltechnik sro pekm  an electronic wire harness manufacturer primarily for the commercial truck market  with facilities in the czech republic and the ukraine

see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for detailed information on these transactions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap 
for a comprehensive discussion of our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements in item in this annual report on form k 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions  particularly relating to revenue recognition and sales commitments  provision for income taxes  restructuring and impairment charges and litigation and contingencies may have a material impact on our financial statements  and are discussed in detail throughout our analysis of our results of operations 
in addition to evaluating estimates relating to the items discussed above  we also consider other estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  defined benefit pension plan assumptions  uncertain tax positions and goodwill and other intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results and outcomes could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions 
see item a risk factors for additional information regarding risk factors that may impact our estimates 
we apply the following critical accounting polices in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and sales commitments we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and sab no 
 revenue recognition  and other authoritative accounting literature 
these pronouncements generally require that we recognize revenue when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  there is a fixed or determinable price and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our products are generally shipped from our facilities to our customers  which is when legal title passes to the customer for substantially all of our revenues 
we enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given platform s life to supply products for that platform 
once we enter into such agreements  fulfillment of our purchasing requirements is our obligation for the entire production life of the platform  with terms generally ranging from five to seven years  and we have no provisions to terminate such contracts 
provisions for anticipated contract losses are recognized at the time they become evident 
in certain instances  we may be committed under existing agreements to supply product to our customers at selling prices that are not 
table of contents sufficient to cover the cost to produce such product 
in such situations  we record a provision for the estimated future amount of such losses 
such losses are recognized at the time that the loss is probable and reasonably estimable and are recorded at the minimum amount necessary to fulfill our obligations to our customers 
we had a provision for anticipated contract losses of million as of december  we had no such provision as of december  and million at december  goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of acquisition purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually in the second fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets 
we review indefinite and definite lived intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the provisions of sfas no 
require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value 
our reporting unit is consistent with the reportable segment identified in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
sfas no 
also requires that the fair value of the purchased intangible assets with indefinite lives be estimated and compared to the carrying value 
we estimate the fair value of these intangible assets using an income approach 
we recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of the intangible asset is less than the carrying value 
in this regard  our management considers the following indicators in determining if events or changes in circumstances have occurred indicating that the recoverability of the carrying amount of indefinite lived and amortizing intangible assets should be assessed a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or a significant physical change in an asset  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected to acquire or construct an asset  and a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with an asset used for the purpose of producing revenue 
our annual goodwill analysis was performed during the second quarter of fiscal and did not result in an impairment charge 
annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances change  a determination is made by management  in accordance with sfas no 
to ascertain whether property and equipment and certain definite lived intangibles have been impaired based on the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows from operating activities 
if the estimated net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such assets  we will recognize an impairment loss in an amount necessary to write down the assets to fair value as determined from expected future discounted cash flows 
in accordance with sfas  we test intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill for impairment annually or when conditions indicate impairment may have occurred 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
the valuation approaches we use include the income approach the discounted cash flow method and the market approach the guideline company and transaction methods to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit  earnings are emphasized in the discounted cash flow  guideline company  and the transaction methods 
in addition  these methods utilize market data in the derivation of a value estimate and are forward looking in nature 
the discounted cash flow method utilizes a market derived rate of return to discount anticipated performance  while the guideline company method and the 
table of contents transaction method incorporate multiples that are based on the market s assessment of future performance 
actual future results may differ materially from those estimates 
intangible assets indefinite lived basis for accounting treatment our indefinite lived intangible assets consist of customer relationships acquired in the acquisitions of mayflower and monona 
we have accounted for these customer relationships as indefinite lived intangible assets  which we believe is appropriate based upon the following circumstances and conditions under which we operate sourcing  barriers to entry and competitor risks the customer sourcing decision for the mayflower and monona businesses is heavily predicated on price  quality  delivery and the overall customer relationship 
absent a significant change in any or all of these factors  it is unlikely that a customer would source production to an alternate supplier 
in addition  the factors listed below impose a high barrier for new competitors to enter into this industry 
historical experience indicates that mayflower and monona have not lost any primary customers and or relationships due to these factors and such loss is not anticipated in the foreseeable future for the following reasons costs associated with setting up a new production line  including tooling costs  are typically cost prohibitive in a competitive pricing environment  the risk associated with potential production delays and a disruption to the supply chain typically outweighs any potential economic benefit  significant initial outlays of capital and institutional production knowledge represent a significant barrier to entry 
due to the asset intensive nature of the businesses  a new competitor would require a substantial amount of initial capital  changeover costs are high both from an economic and risk standpoint  the highly complex nature of successfully producing electronic wiring harnesses and complete cab structures in accordance with oem quality standards makes it difficult for a competitor to enter the business  and there is significant risk in operating the businesses as a result of the highly customized nature of the business 
for example  production runs in the commercial vehicle business are significantly smaller and are more build to order in nature which requires the systems  expertise  equipment and logistics in order to be successful 
these costs and risks are the primary prohibiting factors which preclude our customers from sourcing their business elsewhere at any given time 
duration and strength of existing customer relationships concentrations of revenue mayflower and monona have long standing relationships with their existing customers and have experienced de minimis historical attrition 
these relationships have endured over time and  accordingly  an assumption of prospective attrition is inconsistent with this historical experience and management s expectations 
both mayflower and monona have a limited customer base  consisting of three primary customers  that has existed for many years  and we had pre existing long standing relationships with the same primary customers prior to the acquisitions of mayflower and monona  which in most cases have exceeded a period of years 
we believe the addition of mayflower and monona further strengthens our existing customer relationships with such customers 
specifically mayflower and monona s relationships with their customers key decision making personnel are mature and stable 

table of contents mayflower s and monona s customers typically make purchasing decisions through a team approach versus a single decision maker 
mayflower and monona have historically maintained strong relationships with individuals at all levels of the decision making process including the engineering  operations and purchasing functions in order to successfully minimize the impact of any employee turnover at the customer level 
the top three customers of mayflower and monona have been established customers for a substantial period of time 
mayflower has had relationships with volvo mack  freightliner and international since  and  respectively 
we and or our predecessor entities  had pre existing relationships with these same customers since  and  respectively 
these customers comprised approximately  and of mayflower s revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
monona has had relationships with deere co  caterpillar and oshkosh since  and  respectively 
we and or our predecessor entities  had pre existing relationships with these same customers since  and  respectively 
these customers comprised approximately  and of monona s revenues for fiscal years  and  respectively 
valuation methodology for valuation purposes  the income approach using the discounted cash flow method was employed for the purpose of evaluating the mayflower and monona customer relationship intangible assets 
under this approach  we determined that the fair value of the mayflower and monona customer relationship intangible assets at their dates of acquisition was million and million  respectively 
significant assumptions used in the valuation and determination of an indefinite useful life for these customer relationship intangible assets included the following the revenue projections that we relied upon to substantiate the economic consideration paid for the businesses is almost exclusively tied to the existing customer base 
with regard to the valuation process  we projected less than of total revenue in and to be lost due to core customer attrition and no core customer attrition thereafter 
contributory asset charges were deducted for assets that contribute to income generation including i net working capital  ii personal property  iii real property  iv tradename and trademarks  and v an assembled workforce 
the cash flows associated with the customer relationships acquired in the mayflower and monona transactions were discounted at a rate of return of and  respectively  which is approximately equal to the equity rate of return 
intangible asset impairment accounting treatment if mayflower and or monona were to prospectively lose any of their customers  in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs and of sfas no 
 we would perform an intangible asset impairment test to determine the impact of the loss on the customer relationship intangible asset and if impairment was indicated  we would record an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of operations 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  tax expense includes the impact of differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
to the extent that recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
as of december   we determined that a valuation allowance of million was needed against our deferred tax assets 
this valuation allowance is related to the inability to use certain foreign tax credits and state operating losses that are being carried forward prior to their expiration 
in the event that our actual results differ from our estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  the effects of these adjustments could 
table of contents materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax liability as of december  was million 
we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin in the first quarter the adoption of this interpretation changed the manner in which we evaluate recognition and measurement of uncertain tax positions 
see recently issued accounting pronouncements in note to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the adoption of this authoritative literature 
warranties we are subjected to warranty claims for products that fail to perform as expected due to design or manufacturing deficiencies 
customers continue to require their outside suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the cost of repair or replacement of such products 
depending on the terms under which we supplied products to our customers  a customer may hold us responsible for some or all of the repair or replacement costs of defective products  when the product supplied did not perform as represented 
our policy is to reserve for estimated future customer warranty costs based on historical trends and current economic factors 
the amount of such estimates for warranty provisions was approximately million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
pension and other post retirement benefit plans we sponsor pension and other post retirement benefit plans that cover certain hourly and salaried employees in the united states and united kingdom 
our policy is to make annual contributions to the plans to fund the normal cost as required by local regulations 
in addition  we have an other post retirement benefit plan for certain us operations  retirees and their dependents 
our assumptions the determination of pension and other post retirement benefit plan obligations and related expenses requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of the benefits that employees earn while working  as well as the present value of those benefits 
our assumptions are determined based on current market conditions  historical information and consultation with and input from our actuaries 
due to the significant management judgment involved  our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and other post retirement benefit expenses and obligations 
significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and other post retirement benefit expenses include discount rate  expected return on plan assets  and health care cost trend rates 
discount rate the discount rate represents the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of future cash flows currently expected to be required to settle the pension and other post retirement benefit obligations 
in estimating this rate  we consider rates of return on high quality fixed income investments included in various published bond indexes 
we consider the moody s aa corporate bond index and the barclay s capital aa rated sterling bond index in the determination of the appropriate discount rate assumptions 
the weighted average rate we used to measure our pension obligation as of december  was for the us and for the non us pension plans 
expected long term rate of return the expected return on pension plan assets is based on our historical experience  our pension plan investment strategy and our expectations for long term rates of return 
our pension plan investment strategy is reviewed annually and is established based upon plan liabilities  an evaluation of market conditions  tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments 
we use a third party advisor to assist us in determining our investment allocation and modeling our long term rate of return assumptions 
for and  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of and  respectively  for the us pension plans and and  respectively  for the non us pension plans 

table of contents changes in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets within the range indicated below would have had the following impact on pension and other post retirement benefits results in thousands percentage percentage point increase point decrease decrease increase due to change in assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit costs for the year ended december  discount rate expected long term rate of return on plan assets decrease increase due to change in assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the year ended december  discount rate health care cost trend rates the health care cost trend rates represent the annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits based on estimates of health care inflation  changes in health care utilization or delivery patterns  technological advances and changes in the health status of the plan participants 
for measurement purposes  a annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for and the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to through and remain constant thereafter

related to the unrecognized tax benefits not included in the table above  the company has also recorded a liability for potential penalties of thousand and interest of thousand 
since december   there have been no material changes outside the ordinary course of business to our contractual obligations as set forth above 
in addition to the obligations noted above  we have obligations reported as other long term liabilities that consist primarily of facility closure and consolidation costs  defined benefit plan and other post retirement benefit plans and other items 
we also enter into agreements with our customers at the beginning of a given platform s life to supply products for the entire life of that vehicle platform  which is typically five to seven years 
these agreements generally provide for the supply of a customer s production requirements for a particular platform  rather than for the purchase of a specific quantity of products 
accordingly  our obligations under these agreements are not reflected in the contractual obligations table above 
as of december   we were not party to significant purchase obligations for goods or services 
off balance sheet arrangements we use standby letters of credit to guarantee our performance under various contracts and arrangements  principally in connection with our workers compensation liabilities and for leases on equipment and facilities

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we do enter into financial instruments  from time to time  to manage and reduce the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and to hedge a portion of future anticipated currency transactions 
the counterparties are primarily major financial institutions 
we manage our interest rate risk by balancing the amount of our fixed rate and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value of such debt but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value of such debt  but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
approximately million and million of our debt was variable rate debt at december  and  respectively 
holding other variables constant such as foreign exchange rates and debt levels  a one percentage point change in interest rates would be expected to have an impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows for the next year of approximately million and million  respectively 
the impact on the fair market value of our debt at december  and would have been insignificant 
foreign currency risk foreign currency risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
we use forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency translation exposures of our united kingdom operations 
we estimate our projected revenues in certain foreign currencies or locations  and will hedge a portion or all of the anticipated long or short position 
the contracts typically run from three months up to three years 
these contracts are marked to market and the fair value is included in assets liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets  with the offsetting noncash gain or loss included in other income or expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we do not hold or issue foreign exchange options or forward contracts for trading purposes 
outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts at december  are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the fair value of these contracts at december  and amounted to a million liability and an million asset  respectively  which is reflected in other long term liabilities and other assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
none of these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges  thus  the change in fair value at each reporting date is reflected as a noncash charge income in our consolidated statement of operations 
in  we have elected to designate our future forward exchange contracts as cash flow hedges 
our primary exposures to foreign currency exchange fluctuations are pound sterling  eurodollar and japanese yen 
at december   the potential reduction in earnings from a hypothetical instantaneous adverse change in quoted foreign currency spot rates applied to foreign currency sensitive instruments is limited by the assumption that all of the foreign currencies to which we are exposed would simultaneously decrease by because such synchronized changes are unlikely to occur 
the effects of the forward exchange contracts have been included in the above analysis  however  the sensitivity model does not include the inherent risks associated with the anticipated future transactions denominated in foreign currency 
foreign currency transactions a portion of our revenues during the year ended december  were derived from manufacturing operations outside of the united states 
the results of operations and the financial position of our operations in these other countries are primarily measured in their respective currency and translated into us dollars 
a portion of the expenses generated in these countries is in currencies different from which revenue is generated 
as discussed above  from time to time  we enter into forward exchange contracts to mitigate a portion of this currency risk 
the 
table of contents reported income of these operations will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
a portion of our assets at december  are based in our foreign operations and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period  with the effect of such translation reflected as a separate component of stockholders investment 
accordingly  our stockholders investment will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
effects of inflation inflation potentially affects us in two principal ways 
first  a portion of our debt is tied to prevailing short term interest rates that may change as a result of inflation rates  translating into changes in interest expense 
second  general inflation can impact material purchases  labor and other costs 
in many cases  we have limited ability to pass through inflation related cost increases due to the competitive nature of the markets that we serve 
in the past few years  however  inflation has not been a significant factor
