item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial information and our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes for the years ended december    and included with this report 
the following information contains forward looking statements  see forward looking statements on page of this report 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company formed in  and we are engaged in the exploration  development  acquisition and operation of oil and natural gas properties  with a focus on our reserves and production from the inland waters of louisiana and from our onshore louisiana and texas properties 
we are the largest producer of oil in the state of louisiana  and due to increasing emphasis on our south louisiana operations  we have become predominantly an oil producer  with oil constituting of our domestic production  and oil and natural gas liquids ngls together making up of our domestic production 
this emphasis has allowed us to benefit from better margins for oil production than natural gas production in recent periods 
in december  we agreed to sell substantially all of our new zealand assets to origin energy limited for a minimum of million  with an expected closing towards the end of the first quarter of accordingly  the new zealand operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows and the assets and associated liabilities have been classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets 
the pending sale of these assets resulted in a fourth quarter non cash charge of approximately million net of tax effects based on the selling price and terms of the sales agreement 
we expect to realize total cash proceeds of between and million from the sale of all of our new zealand assets  which we anticipate completing later this year 
proceeds from the new zealand assets sale will most likely be used to pay down a portion of our credit facility 
unless otherwise noted  both historical information for all periods and forward looking information provided in this management s discussion and analysis relates solely to our continuing operations located in the united states  and excludes our discontinued new zealand operations 
in our continuing operations we had record income  cash flows  and production 
income from continuing operations increased to million and cash flows from operating activities from continuing operations increased to million  in each case compared to amounts 
production increased to mmboe  due to increased production in our south louisiana  toledo bend  and south texas regions 
we ended with domestic proved reserves of mmboe  an increase of over year end domestic reserves 
we also had record revenues of million for  an increase of over comparable levels 
our weighted average sales price received increased to per boe for from in our million  or  increase in oil and gas sales revenues primarily resulted from both a million boe increase in production volumes and from higher oil prices during in october  we acquired interests in three south texas fields in the maverick basin from escondido resources  lp  which we collectively identify as the cotulla properties 
the total price for these interests was approximately million after purchase price adjustments 
the mmboe of proved reserves added through this acquisition are located in the sun tsh field in la salle county  the briscoe ranch field primarily in dimmit county  and the las tiendas field in webb county  of which were proved undeveloped and which are predominantly natural gas and natural gas liquids 
these properties added mmboe of production to our total production quantities for we plan to acquire more producing acreage in this area as well  and maintain a two rig drilling program in this area into our overall costs and expenses increased in by 
in  we will continue to focus upon our capital efficiency to better manage our costs and expenses  a difficult task in the inflationary cost environment prevalent in the industry over the last several years 
the largest increase in these costs and expenses in was attributable to higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense  not only due to our larger depletable property base and higher production  but also due to increases in future development costs  which reflect industry cost inflation 
we expect cost pressures to continue to affect the industry throughout  with tightening availability of crews as well as increasing costs of services  goods  and basic equipment 
lake washington is our most significant field  and provides approximately of our domestic production  and in the fourth quarter of  our production fell from third quarter levels 
in the fourth quarter of  along with experiencing natural declines in production as our wells mature  we reduced the choke size of several wells in the newport area to preserve reservoir pressure in anticipation of the pressure maintenance program that will commence with the westside facility start up by mid we continue to drill deeper wells  higher flowing pressure wells  and wells with higher associated natural gas content  and our system must also handle more mature wells that may produce larger volumes of water that require artificial lift 
we believe the pressure maintenance activities planned for and westside facility start up by mid will improve the majority of these production constraints 
our year end domestic proved reserves were crude oil  natural gas  and ngls  compared to crude oil  natural gas  and ngls a year earlier  with of our domestic proved reserves were proved developed at december  our domestic production was crude oil  down from in domestic proved reserves increased to mmboe at year end from mmboe at year end our financial position remains strong even with our recent increase in debt levels during the fourth quarter of our debt to capitalization ratio was at december   compared to at year end  as debt levels increased in  with debt per domestic boe of at year end a increase compared to a year earlier 
our debt to domestic pv ratio decreased to at december  from compared to a year earlier  as higher year end reserves volumes and prices were largely offset by increased borrowings against our line of credit at that date 
our capital expenditures from continuing operations of million increased by million from to  primarily due to our acquisition of the cotulla properties in south texas and the increase in our spending on drilling and development  predominantly in our south louisiana region 
these expenditures were primarily funded by million of cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations  and an increase in debt levels of million 
our current capital expenditure budget is million to million  net of minor non core dispositions and excluding any property acquisitions 
based upon current market conditions and our estimates  our capital expenditures for should be within our anticipated cash flow from operations and currently have budgeted approximately two thirds of these amounts for our south louisiana region  and on an overall basis three fourths for developmental activities 
for  we are targeting production from our continuing operations to increase to and domestic proved reserves to increase to both over levels 
we may also increase our capital expenditure budget if commodity prices rise during the year or if strategic opportunities warrant 
if capital expenditures exceed our cash flow from operating activities  we can fund these expenditures with our credit facility 
during  we plan to further develop our inventory of properties in south louisiana using our expertise and experience gained in expanding and producing in lake washington  together with significant d seismic information  to exploit our other prospect areas covered by similar geological features 
this broad prospect inventory will allow us to be selective in choosing drilling opportunities so we can create long life reserves while at the same time raising our production 
results of continuing operations years ended   and revenues 
our revenues in increased by compared to revenues in primarily due to increased production from our south louisiana region and higher oil prices  and our revenues in increased by compared to revenues due to increases in oil production from our south louisiana area and increases in oil prices 
revenues for   and were substantially comprised of oil and gas sales 
crude oil production was of our production volumes in  in  and in natural gas production was of our production volumes in  in  and in the following table provides information regarding the changes in the sources of our oil and gas sales and volumes for the years ended december    and regions oil and gas sales in millions net oil and gas sales volumes mboe south texas toledo bend south louisiana other total oil and gas sales in increased by  or million  from the level of those revenues for  and our net sales volumes in increased by  or mmboe  over net sales volumes in average prices for oil increased to per bbl in from per bbl in average natural gas prices were virtually unchanged at per mcf in compared to per mcf in average ngl prices increased to per bbl in from per bbl in in  our million increase in oil  ngl  and natural gas sales resulted from volume variances that had a million favorable impact on sales  with million of increases attributable to the million bbl increase in oil sales volumes  million due to the million bbl increase in ngl sales volumes  and million due to the bcf increase in natural gas sales volumes  and price variances that had a million favorable impact on sales  of which million was attributable to the increase in average oil prices received  and million was attributable to the increase in ngl prices  partially offset by a decrease of million attributable to the per mcf decrease in natural gas prices

this activity is recorded in price risk management and other  net on the accompanying statements of income 
had these gains and losses been recognized in the oil and gas sales account  our average oil sales price would have been   and for   and  respectively  and our average natural gas sales price would have been   and for   and  respectively 
in  we settled all insurance claims with our insurers relating to hurricanes katrina and rita for approximately million and entered into a confidential final settlement agreement 
the receipt of these amounts resulted in a benefit of million in recorded in price risk management and other  net  for the portion of the above referenced settlement  which we have determined to be non property damage related claims 
approximately million of the above referenced settlement was determined to be property damage related claims 
we recorded million of the property related settlement as a reduction to proved properties on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet  as this related to reimbursement of capital costs we incurred 
we also recorded million of the property related settlement as a reduction to lease operating cost on the accompanying consolidated statement of income  as this related to reimbursement of repair costs which had been expensed as incurred 
in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows  we have recorded the reimbursement which reduced proved properties as a reduction of cash used in investing activities continuing operations and the remainder of the insurance settlement was recorded as an increase to cash provided by operating activities continuing operations 
costs and expenses 
our expenses in increased million  or  compared to expenses for the reasons noted below 
our general and administrative expenses  net  increased million  or  from the level of such expenses in  while general and administrative expenses  net  increased million  or  over levels 
the increases in both and were primarily due to increased salaries and burdens associated with our expanded workforce  but were also impacted by increased restricted stock grants each year and the expensing of stock options which began in costs also increased in due to ongoing support costs of our new computer system implemented in for the years   and  our capitalized general and administrative costs totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
our net general and administrative expenses per boe produced increased to per boe in from per boe in and per boe in the portion of supervision fees recorded as a reduction to general and administrative expenses was million for  million for  and million for dd a increased million  or  in  from levels and increased million  or  from levels 
the increases in both years are due to increases in the depletable oil and natural gas property base  including future development costs  and higher production  partially offset by higher reserves volumes 
industry costs for services and goods have increased over the last three year period and have contributed to the increase in our dd a expense 
our dd a rate per boe of production was in  in  and in  resulting from increases in per unit cost of reserves additions 
we recorded million  million  and million of accretions to our asset retirement obligation in   and  respectively 
our lease operating costs increased million  or  over the level of such expenses in  while costs increased million  or over levels 
lease operating costs increased during and due to higher production from our three domestic regions  including costs from properties acquired in the fourth quarters of and  increasing costs for industry goods and services  and higher natural gas and ngl processing costs in a portion of the increase in and was from increased well insurance premiums which increased after hurricanes katrina and rita 
our lease operating costs per boe produced were   and in   and  respectively 
severance and other taxes increased million  or  over levels  while in these taxes increased million  or over levels 
the increases in each year were due primarily to higher commodity prices and increased production in our three domestic regions 
severance and other taxes  as a percentage of oil and gas sales  were approximately  and in  and  respectively 
severance taxes on oil in louisiana are of oil sales  which is higher than in the other states where we have production 
as our percentage of oil production in louisiana increased in  the overall percentage of severance costs to sales also increased 
our total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized 
our total interest cost in was million  of which million was capitalized

interest expense on our senior notes due issued in june  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in and million in both and interest expense on our senior subordinated notes due issued in april and retired in  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in and million in both and interest expense on our senior notes due and issued in june  including amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in interest expense on our bank credit facility  including commitment fees and amortization of debt issuance costs  totaled million in  million in  and million in other interest cost was million in each of  and we capitalize a portion of interest related to unproved properties 
the increase in interest expense in was primarily due to an increase in borrowings against our line of credit facility  partially offset by an increase in capitalized interest costs 
the decrease in interest expense in was primarily due to an increase in capitalized interest costs  partially offset by an increase in borrowings against our line of credit facility 
in we incurred million of debt retirement costs related to the redemption of our senior notes due the costs were comprised of approximately million of premiums paid to repurchase the notes  and million to write off unamortized debt issuance costs 
our overall effective tax rate was for  for and for the effective tax rate for and was higher than the statutory rate primarily because of state income taxes and valuation allowances 
for  the effective tax rate was higher than the statutory rate primarily because of state income taxes 
income from continuing operations 
our income from continuing operations for of million was higher than our income from continuing operations of million due to higher oil prices and increased production  partially offset by increased costs including the retirement of our senior notes due our income from continuing operations in of million was higher than our income from continuing operations of million due to higher commodity prices and increased production 
net income 
our net income in of million was lower than our net income of million  mainly due to our loss from discontinued operations of million 
our net income in of million was higher than our net income of million due to higher oil prices and increased production 
discontinued operations in december  swift agreed to sell substantially all of our new zealand assets for approximately million 
accordingly  the new zealand operations have been classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and cash flows and the assets and associated liabilities have been classified as held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets 
we began a strategic review of our new zealand assets in the second quarter of which culminated in the agreement to sell substantially all of these assets in the fourth quarter of  with an expected closing towards the end of the first quarter of proceeds from the new zealand assets sale will most likely be used to pay down a portion of our credit facility 
we expect to sell the remaining new zealand assets sometime in in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  the results of operations and the non cash asset write down for the new zealand operations have been excluded from continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations for the current and prior periods 
furthermore  the assets included as part of this divestiture have been reclassified as held for sale in the balance sheet for prior periods 
during the fourth quarter of  the company assessed its long lived assets in new zealand based on the selling price and terms of the sales agreement and recorded a non cash asset write down of million related to these assets 
this write down is recorded in income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes on the accompanying statement of income 
as of december   operations in new zealand had represented approximately of our total assets and of our sales volumes 
these revenues and expenses were historically reported under our new zealand operating segment  and are now reported under discontinued operations 
the following table summarizes selected data pertaining to discontinued operations in thousands except per share and per boe amounts oil and gas sales other revenues total revenues depreciation  depletion  and amortization other operating expenses non cash write down of property and equipment total expenses income loss from discontinued operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes earnings per common share from discontinued operations  net of taxes diluted total sales volumes mboe oil sales volumes mbbls natural gas sales volumes bcf ngl sales volumes mbbls average sales price per boe oil sales price per bbl natural gas sales price per mcf ngl sales price per bbl lease operating cost per boe total assets cash flow provided by operating activities capital expenditures income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  for decreased compared to the same period of primarily due to the non cash write down of property and equipment  a decrease in produced oil and natural gas volumes which reduced revenues  partially offset by a tax benefit associated with the non cash write down of property and equipment  along with lower depletion expense due to lower production volumes 
for the years   and  our capitalized general and administrative expenses totaled million  million  and million 
income from discontinued operations  net of tax  for decreased compared to the same period of primarily due to a decrease in produced oil and natural gas volumes which reduced revenue  along with higher depletion expense in the period due to an increase in the depletable oil and natural gas property base and lower reserves 
liquidity and capital resources during  we relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of million  credit facility borrowings of million  and cash balances to fund capital expenditures of million including million of acquisitions 
during  we relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of million  credit facility borrowings of million  property sales proceeds of million  and cash balances to fund capital expenditures of million including million of acquisitions 
net cash provided by operating activities 
for  our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million  representing a increase as compared to million generated during the million increase in was primarily due to an increase of million in oil and gas sales  attributable to higher oil prices and production  offset in part by higher lease operating costs and severance taxes due to higher oil prices and higher production 
for  our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was million  representing a increase as compared to million generated during the million increase in was primarily due to an increase of million in oil and gas sales  attributable to higher oil prices and production  offset in part by higher lease operating costs and severance taxes due to higher oil prices and higher production 
accounts receivable 
we assess the collectibility of accounts receivable  and  based on our judgment  we accrue a reserve when we believe a receivable may not be collected 
at both december  and  we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of less than million 
the allowance for doubtful accounts has been deducted from the total accounts receivable balances on the accompanying balance sheets 
existing credit facility 
we had borrowings of million under our bank credit facility at december   and million in borrowings at december  our bank credit facility at december  consisted of a million revolving line of credit with a million borrowing base based entirely on assets from our continuing operations 
the borrowing base is re determined at least every six months and was increased by our bank group from million to million in november under the terms of our bank credit facility  we can increase this commitment amount to the total amount of the borrowing base at our discretion  subject to the terms of the credit agreement 
in september  we increased the commitment amount from million to million 
our revolving credit facility includes requirements to maintain certain minimum financial ratios principally pertaining to adjusted working capital ratios and ebitdax  and limitations on incurring other debt 
we are in compliance with the provisions of this agreement 
our access to funds from our credit facility is not restricted under any material adverse condition clause  a clause that is common for credit agreements to include 
a material adverse condition clause can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have an adverse or material effect on operations  financial condition  prospects or properties  and would impair the ability to make timely debt repayments 
our credit facility includes covenants that require us to report events or conditions having a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facility is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 
working capital 
our working capital increased from a deficit of million at december   to a deficit of million at december  the improvement primarily resulted from a reclassification of new zealand oil and natural gas properties to assets held for sale within current assets  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued capital costs 
debt retirements and debt issuances 
in june  we issued million of senior notes due in june  we redeemed all million of senior subordinated notes due and recorded a charge of million related to the redemption of these notes  which is recorded in debt retirement costs on the accompanying condensed consolidated statement of income 
the costs were comprised of approximately million of premium paid to redeem the notes  and million to write off unamortized debt issuance costs 
debt maturities 
our credit facility  with a balance of million at december   extends until october  our million of senior notes mature july   and our million of senior notes mature june  capital expenditures 
in we relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of  credit facility borrowings of million  and cash balances to fund capital expenditures of million including million of acquisitions 
we have spent considerable time and capital on facility capacity upgrades and additions in the lake washington field 
since acquiring the property  we have upgraded three production platforms  added new compression for the gas lift system  and installed a new oil delivery system and permanent barge loading facility 
during  we began planning for the addition of a fourth production platform  the westside facility  which will increase our processing capacity another  barrels per day by mid we completed of wells in  for a success rate of 
a total of development wells were drilled in the lake washington area  of which were completed  and development wells were drilled successfully in the awp olmos area 
in bay de chene  we successfully drilled two development wells and drilled five exploratory wells  of which two were completed 
we also drilled successful development wells in the south bearhead creek area  drilled seven development wells in the cotulla area  of which six were completed  and drilled one successful development well in the bayou sale field 
our capital expenditures were approximately million in and million in in  we relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations of million  bank borrowings of million  and cash balances to fund capital expenditures of million  including acquisitions of million 
during  we relied upon our net cash provided by operating activities of million to fund capital expenditures of million  including acquisitions of million 
in  we participated in drilling development wells and six exploratory wells  of which development wells were completed 
contractual commitments and obligations our contractual commitments for the next five years and thereafter as of december  are as follows thereafter total in thousands non cancelable operating leases asset retirement obligation drilling rigs  seismic and pipe inventory senior notes due senior notes due credit facility total our most significant office lease is in houston  texas and it extends until amounts shown by year are the fair values at december  amounts do not include the interest obligation  which is paid semiannually 
the credit facility expires in october and these amounts exclude a million standby letter of credit outstanding under this facility 
domestic proved oil and gas reserves at year end  our domestic proved reserves were mmboe with a pv value of billion pv is a non gaap measure  see the section titled oil and natural gas reserves in our property section for a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to the closest gaap measure  the standardized measure 
in  our domestic proved natural gas reserves increased bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves decreased mmbbl  or  and our ngl reserves increased mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent increase of mmboe  or 
in  our domestic proved natural gas reserves increased bcf  or  while our proved oil reserves increased mmbbl  or  and our ngl reserves decreased mmbbl  or  for a total equivalent increase of mmbbl  or 
we added reserves over the past three years through both our drilling activity and purchases of minerals in place 
through drilling we added mmboe of proved reserves in  mmboe in  and mmboe in through acquisitions we added mmboe of proved reserves in  bcfe in  and bcfe in at year end  of our total proved reserves were proved developed  compared with at year end and at year end the pv value of our domestic proved reserves at year end increased from the pv value at year end natural gas prices increased in to per mcf from per mcf at year end  compared to per mcf at year end oil prices increased in to per bbl from per bbl at year end  compared to in under sec guidelines  estimates of proved reserves must be made using year end oil and gas sales prices and are held constant for that year s reserves calculation throughout the life of the properties 
subsequent changes to such year end oil and natural gas prices could have a significant impact on the calculated pv value 
commodity price trends and uncertainties oil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile in the future 
the price of oil has increased over the last three years and is at historical highs when compared to longer term historical prices 
factors such as worldwide supply disruptions  worldwide economic conditions  weather conditions  fluctuating currency exchange rates  and political conditions in major oil producing regions  especially the middle east  can cause fluctuations in the price of oil 
domestic natural gas prices have fallen from highs in but continue to remain high when compared to longer term historical prices 
north american weather conditions  the industrial and consumer demand for natural gas  storage levels of natural gas  the level of liquefied natural gas imports  and the availability and accessibility of natural gas deposits in north america can cause significant fluctuations in the price of natural gas 
income taxes the tax laws in the jurisdictions we operate in are continuously changing and professional judgments regarding such tax laws can differ 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  deferred taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities  given the provisions of the enacted tax laws 
on january   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
under fin  tax positions are evaluated for recognition using a more likely than not threshold  and those tax positions requiring recognition are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
as a result of adopting fin  we reported a million decrease to our january  retained earnings balance and a corresponding increase to other long term liabilities 
this was also the total balance of our unrecognized tax benefits  which would fully impact our effective tax rate if recognized 
there were no increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits during the year ended december  our policy is to record interest and penalties relating to income taxes in income tax expense 
as of december  and no interest or penalties relating to income taxes have been incurred or recognized 
our cumulative interest exposure on unrecognized tax benefits is not material 
our us federal and state of louisiana income tax returns from forward  our new zealand income tax returns after  and our texas franchise tax returns after remain subject to examination by the taxing authorities 
there are no unresolved items related to periods previously audited by these taxing authorities 
no other state returns are significant to our financial position 
in the third quarter of we increased the valuation allowance for our capital loss carryforward assets by million to cover the full value of the carryforward 
the increase in the valuation allowance was due to changes in the company s property disposition plans and increased income tax expense of million in that period 
critical accounting policies the following summarizes several of our critical accounting policies 
see a complete list of significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of certain assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of certain revenues and expenses during each reporting period 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from such estimates 
significant estimates and assumptions underlying these financial statements include the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion of oil and natural gas properties and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows there from  estimates of future costs to develop and produce reserves  accruals related to oil and gas revenues  capital expenditures and lease operating expenses  estimates in the calculation of stock compensation expense  estimates of our ownership in properties prior to final division of interest determination  the estimated future cost and timing of asset retirement obligations  and estimates made in our income tax calculations 
while we are not aware of any material revisions to any of our estimates  there will likely be future revisions to our estimates resulting from matters such as changes in new accounting pronouncements  ownership interests  payouts  joint venture audits  re allocations by purchasers or pipelines  or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and gas industry  many of which require retroactive application 
these types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs 
property and equipment 
we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas property and equipment costs 
under this method of accounting  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in the exploration  development  and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized 
such costs may be incurred both prior to and after the acquisition of a property and include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical services  drilling  completion  and equipment 
internal costs incurred that are directly identified with exploration  development  and acquisition activities undertaken by us for our own account  and which are not related to production  general corporate overhead  or similar activities  are also capitalized 
for the years   and  such internal costs capitalized totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
interest costs are also capitalized to unproved oil and natural gas properties 
for the years   and  capitalized interest on unproved properties totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
interest not capitalized and general and administrative costs related to production and general overhead are expensed as incurred 
full cost ceiling test 
at the end of each quarterly reporting period  the unamortized cost of oil and natural gas properties including gas processing facilities  capitalized asset retirement obligations  net of related salvage values and deferred income taxes  and excluding the recognized asset retirement obligation liability is limited to the sum of the estimated future net revenues from proved properties excluding cash outflows from recognized asset retirement obligations  including future development and abandonment costs of wells to be drilled  using period end prices  adjusted for the effects of hedging  discounted at  and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties adjusted for related income tax effects ceiling test 
our hedges at december  consisted of oil and natural gas price floors with strike prices lower than the period end price and did not materially affect this calculation 
this calculation is done on a country by country basis 
the calculation of the ceiling test and provision for dd a is based on estimates of proved reserves 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting the future rates of production  timing  and plan of development 
the accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
results of drilling  testing  and production subsequent to the date of the estimate may justify revision of such estimates 
accordingly  reserves estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
our reserves estimates are prepared in accordance with securities and exchange commission guidelines and are audited on an annual basis at year end by a firm of independent petroleum engineers in accordance with standards approved by the board of directors of the society of petroleum engineers 
given the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  it is reasonably possible that our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves could change in the near term 
if oil and natural gas prices decline significantly from our period end prices used in the ceiling test  even if only for a short period  it is possible that non cash write downs of oil and natural gas properties could occur in the future 
if we have significant declines in our oil and natural gas reserves volumes  which also reduce our estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved oil and natural gas reserves  a non cash write down of our oil and natural gas properties could occur in the future 
we cannot control and cannot predict what future prices for oil and natural gas will be  thus we cannot estimate the amount or timing of any potential future non cash write down of our oil and natural gas properties if a sizable decrease in oil and or natural gas prices were to occur 
revenue recognition 
oil and gas revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price  when delivery has occurred and title has transferred  and if collectibility of the revenue is probable 
the company uses the entitlement method of accounting in which the company recognizes its ownership interest in production as revenue 
if our sales exceed our ownership share of production  the natural gas balancing payables are reported in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet 
natural gas balancing receivables are reported in other current assets on the accompanying balance sheet when our ownership share of production exceeds sales 
as of december   we did not have any material natural gas imbalances 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
it does not create or modify any current gaap requirements to apply fair value accounting 
however  it provides a single definition for fair value that is to be applied consistently for all prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas no 
was effective for fiscal periods beginning after november  on february   the fasb delayed the effective date of sfas no 
for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  at least annually 
for swift  this action defers the effective date for those assets and liabilities until january  we believe that the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits entities to measure eligible assets and liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted sfas no 
on january  and did not elect to apply the fair value method to any eligible assets or liabilities at that time 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas no 
r provides enhanced guidance related to the measurement of identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed and disclosure of information related to business combinations and their effect on the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk 
our major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
the effects of such pricing volatility are expected to continue 
our price risk management policy permits the utilization of agreements and financial instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps and options contracts to mitigate price risk associated with fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
below is a description of the financial instruments we have utilized to hedge our exposure to price risk 
price floors at december   we had in place price floors in effect through the march contract month for oil and natural gas 
the oil price floors cover notional volumes of  barrels  with a weighted average floor price of per barrel 
our oil price floors in place at december   are expected to cover approximately to of our estimated oil production from january to march the natural gas price floors cover notional volumes of  mmbtu  with a weighted average floor price of per mmbtu 
our natural gas price floors in place at december   are expected to cover approximately to of our natural gas production in february and march the fair value of these instruments at december   was million and is recognized on the accompanying balance sheet in other current assets 
there are no additional cash outflows for these price floors  as the cash premium was paid at inception of the hedge 
the maximum loss that could be sustained on our financial statements from these price floors in would be their fair value at december  of million 
interest rate risk 
our senior notes and senior subordinated notes both have fixed interest rates  so consequently we are not exposed to cash flow risk from market interest rate changes on these notes 
at december   we had borrowings of million under our credit facility  which bears a floating rate of interest and therefore is susceptible to interest rate fluctuations 
the result of a fluctuation in the bank s base rate would constitute basis points and would not have a material adverse effect on our cash flows based on this same level of borrowing 
income tax carryforwards 
during  the company recorded a write down and valuation allowance totaling million for capital loss carryforwards as detailed in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the company has other net tax carryforwards for federal alternative minimum tax credits million and state tax net operating loss carryforwards million which in management s judgment will more likely than not be utilized to offset future taxable earnings 
the company s new zealand subsidiaries have local income tax loss carryovers  a portion of which will offset the sales proceeds from the liquidation of assets 
we have estimated a net loss carryover asset of million will remain after closing of the pending transaction 
in management s judgment it is less than more likely than not that the remaining carryover will be utilized 
accordingly  this carryover asset has been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
fair value of financial instruments 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank borrowings  and senior notes 
the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the highly liquid or short term nature of these instruments 
the fair values of the bank borrowings approximate the carrying amounts as of december  and  and were determined based upon variable interest rates currently available to us for borrowings with similar terms 
based upon quoted market prices as of december   the fair value of our senior notes due  which were issued during  were million  or of face value 
based upon quoted market prices as of december  and  the fair values of our senior notes due were million  or of face value  and million  or of face value 
the carrying value of our senior notes due was million at december  the carrying value of our senior notes due was million at december for both and foreign currency risk 
we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currencies  most notably the new zealand dollar 
fluctuations in rates between the new zealand dollar and us dollar may impact our financial results from our new zealand subsidiaries since we have receivables  liabilities  natural gas and ngl sales contracts  and new zealand income tax calculations  all denominated in new zealand dollars 
we use the us dollar as our functional currency in new zealand and as currency rate changes between the us dollar and the new zealand dollar  we recognize transaction gains and losses in income loss from discontinued operations  net of taxes on the accompanying statements of income 
customer credit risk 
we are exposed to the risk of financial non performance by customers 
our ability to collect on sales to our customers is dependent on the liquidity of our customer base 
to manage customer credit risk  we monitor credit ratings of customers and seek to minimize exposure to any one customer where other customers are readily available 
due to availability of other purchasers  we do not believe the loss of any single oil or natural gas customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations
