the decrease in our managed equipment fleet from december  to december  is due primarily to our purchase of approximately  units or approximately  teu of managed containers from the third party owner in october which are included in our owned equipment fleet as of december  we generally lease our equipment on a per diem basis to our customers under three types of leases long term leases  service leases and finance leases 
long term leases  typically with terms of three to eight years  provide us with stable cash flow and low transaction costs by requiring customers to maintain specific units on hire for the duration of the lease 
service leases command a premium per diem rate in exchange for providing customers with a greater level of operational flexibility by allowing the pick up and drop off of units during the lease term 
finance leases  which are typically structured as full payout leases  provide for a predictable recurring revenue stream with the lowest daily cost to the customer because customers are generally required to retain the equipment for the duration of its useful life 
as of december   approximately of our containers and chassis were on hire to customers  with approximately of our equipm ent on long term leases  approximately on finance leases and approximately on service leases or long term leases whose fixed terms have expired but for which the related units remain on hire and for which we continue to receive rental payments  in addition  approximately of our fleet was available for lease and approximately was available for sale

operating performance our profitability is primarily determined by the extent to which our leasing and other revenues exceed our ownership  operating and administrative expenses 
our profitability is also impacted by the gain or loss that we realize on the sale of our used equipment and the net sales margins on our equipment trading activities 
our profitability for the year ended december  was supported by high utilization in all of our major product lines  strong gains on the sale of our used containers  and strong sales margins from our equipment trading activity 
our leasing revenue is primarily driven by our owned fleet size  utilization and average rental rates 
our leasing revenue is also impacted by the mix of leases in our portfolio 
during  our owned container fleet increased on a teu basis to million owned teu 
as of december   our revenue earning assets leasing equipment  net investment in finance leases  and equipment held for sale totaled approximately billion  an increase of approximately million  or  over december  the growth in the net book value of our revenue earning assets exceeded the growth rate of our owned fleet on a teu basis since our new chassis and port equipment investments are more expensive than dry containers on a per teu basis and since the growth of our fleet has decreased the average age  and increased the average net book value  of the units in our fleet 
in  excluding equipment trading units purchased for resale  we purchased approximately  teu of new equipment and purchased an additional  teu of used containers that we had previously managed 
the large volume of our new equipment purchases was supported by continued strong growth in international containerized trade 
in december  clarkson s research services estimated that worldwide containerized trade growth would exceed in despite the slowing economy in the united states  as strong growth in the asia to europe  intra asia and other trades offset slow growth in the asia to north america trade 
most of tal s large customers participate in numerous major trade lanes  and we are more impacted by the overall growth in worldwide containerized trade than growth in any particular trade lane 
we are currently experiencing a customer shift in the lease vs 
buy decision  resulting in the increasing direct purchases of containers by our shipping line customers 
for most of the last twenty years  the percentage of containers owned by leasing companies worldwide has been relatively stable at about 
however  over the past few years this percentage has decreased  and according to containerisation international  leasing companies owned roughly of the world s containers at the end of we believe that the increased share of containers owned directly by the shipping lines is the result of the improved financial performance  increased operating scale and improved information systems of our customers  which make it easier for our customers to finance and deploy new container purchases efficiently 
in we sold approximately  teu of our older containers  excluding containers purchased for resale 
over the last three years  our disposal of older containers has averaged 
table of contents approximately  teu per year  which represents an average of approximately of our container fleet at the beginning of each year 
this annual disposal rate is close to our theoretical steady state disposal rate given the year expected useful life of our containers 
however  based on the age profile of our existing fleet and scheduled lease expirations  we expect our rate of disposals will increase for several years beginning in before decreasing for several years thereafter 
a disproportionately large share of our containers were produced before since we invested in a relatively small number of containers from through we expect that we will sell most of the pre units over the next several years 
during years of above average disposals  our teu growth rate may be constrained if we are unable to generate a sufficient number of attractive lease transactions for an expanded level of new container purchases 
the following table sets forth our average equipment fleet utilization for the periods indicated below

utilization of our container fleet was relatively high throughout our average utilization increased to for the year ended december   while utilization of our containers excluding off hire new units was fairly steady and quite strong throughout in the range of to 
the quarterly variation in our overall utilization in as well as the difference between and ending overall utilization were primarily driven by changes in our inventory of new containers 
utilization for our dry containers was supported throughout by strong cargo growth  a low volume of drop offs  enhanced logistical protections in our lease contracts  high prices for new containers and the strong used container sale market 
our utilization was also supported by the large percentage of our dry containers on long term lease and finance lease 
our volume of dry container pick ups slowed in the fourth quarter due to the end of the typical summer peak season  but utilization remained solid since off hire volumes were controlled and new container deliveries were low 
leasing demand for our refrigerated containers was relatively strong  though seasonal  in the utilization of our refrigerated containers does not heavily influence our overall utilization since they represent only approximately of the units in our fleet 
however  these container types are significantly more expensive than dry containers  generate higher per diem lease rates and currently represent over of our leasing revenue 
we achieved solid on hire and utilization growth early in 
table of contents the year during the winter peak season and late in the year at the start of the winter peak season 
demand during the typically slow summer season for refrigerated containers was light 
leasing demand and utilization for our special containers was strong throughout  while leasing demand for chassis was weak due to the combination of chassis operating efficiency gains through a greater use of chassis pools and a slowdown in the growth of the asia to north america trade 
average lease rates for our dry container product line in decreased by from the average level in the decrease in average dry container lease rates was primarily due to decreasing lease rates in  and dry container lease rates were relatively stable in dry container lease rates decreased in the first half of primarily due to the impact of several large lease extension transactions 
in these transactions  we extended the term of several large leases covering older containers and reduced the lease rate on the containers in return 
new dry container prices remained fairly stable during at more than  for a dry container 
based on new container prices  we would normally expect that market leasing rates for new dry containers would be above our portfolio average 
however  we experienced very aggressive pricing for new container leases by a number of our competitors  and we generally did not get a rate benefit from new dry container transactions completed in average lease rates for refrigerated containers in decreased by compared to the decrease in average lease rates for refrigerated containers primarily resulted from decreasing rates in as a result of lease extension transactions completed in lease rates for new refrigerated containers were relatively flat in average lease rates for special containers increased during compared to  reflecting increased prices for special containers and strong leasing demand 
the percentage of our units on finance leases increased to as of december   compared to as of december  finance lease revenue increased to million in as compared to million in the prior year 
while our finance lease revenue was million higher for the year ended december  compared to the comparable period in  the increase in the portion of our units covered by finance leases resulted in a smaller increase in leasing revenue compared to the amount we would have recognized if the units were placed on operating leases 
for a finance lease  the lease payment from the customer is split into interest and principal components  and we only recognize the interest component as revenue while the principal component decreases the carrying value of the finance lease on the balance sheet 
for an operating lease  the entire lease payment is recognized as revenue  while the carrying value of the container equipment is reduced through depreciation expense 
for the year ended december   our finance lease billings exceeded our recognized finance lease revenue by million 
for the year ended december   we recognized a million gain on the sale of our used containers compared to a million gain for the year ended december  the improvement compared to last year mainly resulted from higher selling prices for containers sold in for most of  selling prices for used containers were supported by high prices for new containers and high utilization of leasing company and shipping line containers 
high utilization of containers constrains the supply of used containers available for sale 
the higher gain on the sale of our used equipment was also driven by an increase in the average age of sold units 
the average container sale age for tal increased to years in from years in and years in older units generally have a lower net book value and result in higher disposal gains since used container sale prices are not highly affected by the age of the container 
during  we recognized a gross sales margin of million on the sale of equipment purchased for resale compared to million of gross sales margin for in  we sold higher volumes and achieved higher per unit selling margins 
unit sale margins in were helped by a 
table of contents steady increase in used container sale prices during the year 
it typically takes us two to three months to sell containers purchased for re sale  and when used container sale prices are increasing  our selling margin is boosted by the increase in market prices during our hold period in addition to the trading margin that we seek to achieve 
our primary ownership expenses  depreciation and interest expense  increased a combined for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase was substantially less than the growth rate of our equipment fleet primarily due to a decrease in depreciation expense resulting from a large vintage year of containers reaching the end of its depreciable life on october  in addition  the increase in the percentage of our units on finance lease resulted in a reduction in the growth rate of our depreciation expense relative to the level we would have experienced if the units were placed on operating leases 
another large vintage year of containers reached the end of its depreciable life on october  the resulting decrease in depreciation expense in the fourth quarter was partially offset by depreciation expense associated with the purchase of  teu of older managed containers 
beginning january   depreciation expense will also be impacted by the start of depreciation on equipment inspected and accepted at the manufacturer in  but not yet in service 
our interest expense increased for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was lower than the increase in the carrying value of our revenue earning assets over the same period 
this was due to the fact that much of the equipment purchased in was paid for in the second half of the year  as well as the benefit of lower interest rates for the full year as a result of the asset securitization program which was completed in april dividends in march  may  august and december the company paid a quarterly dividend per share of   and  respectively on its issued and outstanding common stock 
on march   the company s board of directors approved and declared a per share quarterly cash dividend on its issued and outstanding common stock  payable on april  to shareholders of record at the close of business on march  treasury stock we repurchased  of our common shares in the open market during at a total cost of approximately million

total leasing revenues were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase primarily resulted from a larger number of dry and special containers and chassis in our fleet and higher utilization for dry and refrigerated containers 
additionally  our leasing revenue increased by approximately million due to the purchase of  teu of older managed equipment 
this purchase had the effect of increasing our leasing revenue  operating expenses  depreciation and 
table of contents interest expenses  and decreasing our management fees 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in per diem rates for dry and refrigerated containers and a decrease in fee revenue resulting from a decrease in drop off volume 
while our finance lease revenue increased by million  the increase in the portion of our units on finance leases resulted in a reduction in our overall leasing revenue compared to the amount we would have recognized if the units were placed on operating leases 
under a finance lease  we only recognize interest income as revenue while the principal component of the lease payment reduces the net finance lease receivable on the balance sheet 
under an operating lease we recognize the entire monthly billing as revenue  and reduce the net book value of the underlying equipment through depreciation expense 
for the year ended december   our finance lease billings exceeded our recognized finance lease revenue by million 
for the year ended dece mber   our finance lease billings exceeded our recognized finance lease revenue by million 
equipment trading activities 
equipment trading revenue represents the proceeds on the sale of equipment purchased for resale

the decrease was primarily due to certain equipment becoming fully depreciated in the fourth quarter of  as well as a million impact from delay in the start date of depreciation for units purchased in in past years  depreciation on new units started after our inspection and acceptance of units at the manufacturer 
beginning in  new units start depreciation the earlier of when they are placed in service or january of the year following the year of purchase

unrealized loss gain on interest rate swaps 
unrealized loss on interest rate swaps was million for the year ended december   compared to unrealized gain of million for the year ended december  the net fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was a net asset of approximately million at december   as compared to a net asset of million at december   with the decrease in fair value due to a decrease in interest rates 
management fees and other parent company charges 
management fees and other parent company charges were zero for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  management fees of million for the year ended december  were payable pursuant to certain management agreements which terminated upon the completion of the ipo in october 
table of contents income tax expense 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december   compared to an income tax expense of million for the year ended december   and the effective tax rates for the periods were and respectively 
the difference in the rate between and is primarily attributable to certain stock based compensation for that is not deductible for income tax purposes 
while we record income tax expense  we do not currently pay any significant federal  state or foreign income taxes due to the availability of accelerated tax depreciation for our equipment 
the vast majority of the expense recorded for income taxes is recorded as a deferred income tax liability on the balance sheet 
we expect the deferred income tax liability balance to grow for the foreseeable future

pre tax income excludes unrealized gains and losses on interest rate swaps  management fees and write off of deferred financing costs 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and borrowings under our asset backed securitization abs program and our revolving credit facility 
our cash flows are 
table of contents used to finance capital expenditures  provide working capital  meet debt service requirements  and pay dividends 
we believe that cash from operations and existing cash  together with available borrowings under our abs program and our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  and our scheduled interest and debt payments for at least the next twelve months 
however  our ability to make future capital expenditures and fully implement our current growth plans is dependent on our ability to increase our lending commitments 
we periodically make capital investments to  among other things  maintain and expand our container fleet 
since  we have relied on our asset securitization warehouse facility to finance the majority of our new container investments 
the current asset securitization warehouse facility converts to a nine year term loan in april and we do not expect to be able to use this facility to finance further investments at that time 
while we are seeking to structure a new warehouse facility or obtain other suitable financing  we are facing significant disruptions in the capital markets  and in the asset backed securitization market in particular  that have made it more difficult and more expensive to secure additional financing commitments 
while we expect to be able to gain access to additional financing to fund our growth plans  if we are unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient additional financing we deem suitable  we will not be able to invest in our fleet in at the level we would normally invest at and our future growth rate and profitability will decrease 
even if we are successful in securing additional financial commitments  we expect that our interest rates will increase 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to finance our capital expenditures in future years  especially if the current disruptions in the capital markets persist 
our future operating performance and ability to increase  extend or refinance our indebtedness may be dependent on future economic conditions and financial  business and other factors that are beyond our control 
at december   our outstanding indebtedness was comprised of the following amounts in millions

the maximum borrowing levels depicted in the chart above may not reflect the actual availability under all of the credit facilities 
certain of these facilities are governed by borrowing bases that limit borrowing capacity to an established percentage of relevant assets 
covenant compliance we are subject to various covenant requirements under our debt facilities 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
asset backed securitization facility our asset backed securitization program has been the primary credit facility used to finance our existing container fleet and new container purchases since the program s inception in april of in general  the program is intended to consist of a warehouse facility to fund new container purchases and series of term notes that will be issued periodically to provide permanent financing for equipment 
table of contents initially funded through the warehouse facility 
the term notes issued in april were used to finance the majority of the containers in our fleet at that time  and the existing warehouse facility has primarily been used to finance our new container purchases since april the current warehouse facility was initially structured to have a limit of million 
it was our original intention to issue term notes to refinance the containers funded through the warehouse at the time that outstanding funding in the warehouse approached the million limit 
however  the market for asset backed term notes has been significantly disrupted for the last six months  and we have decided to delay refinancing the existing warehouse facility and instead opted to increase the size of the warehouse facility 
on august   we increased the warehouse facility from million to million 
on november   we increased the warehouse facility from million to million 
the abs warehouse facility automatically converts to a nine year term loan with an increased interest margin as of april  we will likely seek to refinance the existing warehouse or converted term loan with a new abs term series or another form of term financing when credit markets improve 
revolving credit agreement on august   the company entered into a revolving credit agreement which refinanced the previously existing senior secured credit facility  which was terminated in accordance with its terms 
the initial commitment under the revolving credit agreement was million  but will periodically step down to million on january  and million by march  the maturity date of the revolving credit agreement is august  term loan facility on november   the company entered into a three year term loan  which is secured by approximately  teu of previously managed dry and special containers that the company purchased from its largest third party container owner on october  the final maturity date of the loan is november  our initial borrowing under this facility of million was made on november  we made an additional borrowing under this facility of million on january  pursuant to a lender commitment dated december  finance lease facility on july   we entered into a million credit facility to support the growth of our finance lease business the finance lease facility 
the finance lease facility has a two year revolving period that precedes a ten year term in which the outstanding balance  as of the term conversion date  amortizes in monthly installments 
the finance lease facility is secured by the finance lease receivables associated with certain containers and chassis not included in the spe 
the finance lease facility has a final maturity of july port equipment facility on december   we entered into a euro denominated credit facility to support a port equipment financing transaction the port equipment facility 
the port equipment facility has an eight year term and amortizes in equal monthly installments 
capital lease obligations we have entered into a series of capital leases with various financial institutions to finance the purchase of chassis 
the lease agreements have been structured as ten year terminal rental adjustment clause trac leases with purchase options at the end of the lease terms equal to the trac amount as defined in each lease 
for income tax purposes  these leases are treated as operating leases 

table of contents dividends paid in march  may  august and december the company paid a quarterly dividend per share of   and  respectively on its issued and outstanding common stock 
on march   the company s board of directors approved and declared a per share quarterly cash dividend on its issued and outstanding common stock  payable on april  to shareholders of record at the close of business on march  treasury stock on march   our board of directors authorized a stock buyback program for the repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock

amounts include actual and estimated interest for floating rate debt based on december  rates and the net effect of the interest rate swaps 
warehouse facility will convert to a term loan in april and will be repaid over nine years 
amounts include interest 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such entities which are often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 
we are  therefore  not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates are based on historical experience and currently available information 
actual results could differ from such estimates 
the following paragraphs summarize our critical accounting policies 
additional accounting policies are discussed in the notes to our historical financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k 
revenue recognition operating leases with customers we enter into long term leases and service leases with ocean carriers  principally as lessor in operating leases  for marine cargo equipment 
long term leases provide our customers with specified equipment for a specified term 
our leasing revenues are based upon the number of equipment units leased  the applicable per diem rate and the length of the lease 
long term leases typically range for a period of three to eight years 
revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the respective lease 
advanced billings are deferred and recognized in the period earned 
service leases do not specify the exact number of equipment units to be leased or the term that each unit will remain on hire but allow the lessee to pick up and drop off units at various locations specified in the lease agreement 
under a service lease  rental revenue is based on the number of equipment units on hire for a given period 
revenue for customers where collection is not rea sonably assured is deferred 
table of contents and recognized when the amounts are received 
also  in accordance with eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  we recognize billings to customers for damages incurred and certain other pass through costs as leasing revenue as it is earned based on the terms of the contractual agreements with the customer 
finance leases with customers we enter into finance leases as lessor for some of the equipment in our fleet 
the net investment in finance leases represents the receivables due from lessees  net of unearned income 
unearned income is recognized on a level yield basis over the lease term and is recorded as leasing revenue 
finance leases are usually long term in nature  typically ranging for a period of five to ten years and typically include a bargain purchase option to purchase the equipment at the end of the lease term 
equipment trading revenue and expense equipment trading revenue represents the proceeds on the sale of equipment purchased for resale 
the related expenses represent the cost of equipment sold as well as other selling costs that are recognized as incurred and are reflected as equipment trading expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
management fee income we manage equipment which is owned by third parties and we earn management fees based on the income earned by the leasing and sales of such equipment 
amounts we collect as agent on behalf of third parties that own such equipment are not included in revenue and costs paid for managed equipment are not included in expense 
other revenues other revenues include fee income for third party positioning of equipment 
direct operating expenses direct operating expenses are directly related to our equipment under and available for lease 
these expenses primarily consist of our costs to repair and maintain the equipment  to reposition the equipment  to store the equipment when it is not on lease  to inspect newly manufactured equipment and a provision for equipment lost or not expected to be returned 
these costs are recognized when incurred 
in limited situations  certain positioning costs may be capitalized 
leasing equipment leasing equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated to an estimated residual value on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life 
we will continue to review our depreciation policies on a regular basis to determine whether changes have taken place that would suggest that a change in our depreciation policies  useful lives of our equipment or the assigned residual values is warranted 
in addition  periodically a determination is made  if indicators of impairment are present  as to whether the carrying value of our fleet exceeds its estimated future undiscounted cash flows 
the estimated useful lives for our leasing equipment ranges from to years from the date of manufacture  for both the successor and predecessor companies 
estimated useful lives have been based on independent appraisals and will be adjusted if necessary based on actual experience 
costs incurred to place new equipment into service  including costs to transport the equipment to its initial on hire location  are capitalized 
we charge inspection costs on new equipment and repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the lives of the assets at the time the costs are incurred  and include these costs in direct operating expenses 
an allowance is provided through direct operating expenses based on the net book value of a percentage of the units on lease to certain customers that are considered to be non performing which we believe we will not ultimately recover 
the percentage is developed based on historical experience 

table of contents equipment held for sale in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 equipment held for sale is carried at the lower of its fair value  based on current transactions  less costs to sell or carrying value  depreciation on such assets is halted and disposals generally occur within ninety days 
subsequent changes to the asset s fair value  either increases or decreases  are recorded as adjustments to the carrying value of the equipment held for sale  however  any such adjustments would not exceed the equipment s carrying value at the time it was initially classified as held for sale 
initial write downs of assets held for sale are recorded as an impairment ch arge and are included in net gain on sale of leasing equipment 
realized gains and losses resulting from the sale of equipment held for sale are recorded as a net gain on sale of leasing equipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is updated on a regular basis and is based upon a review of the collectibility of our receivables 
this review considers the risk profile of the customer  credit quality indicators such as the level of past due amounts and economic conditions 
an account is considered past due when a payment has not been received in accordance with the contractual terms 
accounts are generally charged off after an analysis is completed which indicates that collection of the full principal balance is in doubt 
changes in economic conditions or other events may necessitate additions or deductions to the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to provide for losses inherent in our receivables  and requires the application of estimates and judgments as to the outcome of collection efforts and the realization of collateral  among other things 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to pro vide for credit losses inherent in our existing receivables 
however  actual losses could exceed the amounts provided for in certain periods

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of changes in value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in results of our operations and cash flows 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  and credit risks 
foreign currency exchange rate risk although we have significant foreign based operations  the us dollar is the operating currency for the majority of our leases both customers obligations and company obligations  and most of our revenues and operating expenses in fiscal years and were denominated in us dollars 
as a result  foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact our financial results in those periods 
interest rate risk we enter into interest rate swap contracts to fix the interest rates on a portion of our debt 
we assess and manage the external and internal risk associated with these derivative instruments in accordance with our overall operating goals 
external risk is defined as those risks outside of our direct control  including counterparty credit risk  liquidity risk  systemic risk and legal risk 
internal risk relates to those operational risks within the management oversight structure and includes actions taken in contravention of our policy 
the primary external risk of our interest rate swap contracts is counterparty credit exposure  which is defined as the ability of a counterparty to perform its financial obligations under a derivative contract 
all derivative agreements are with major money center financial institutions rated investment grade by nationally recognized rating agencies  with our counterparties rated a or better 
credit exposures are measured based on the market value of outstanding derivative instruments 
both current exposures and potential exposures are calculated for each derivative contract to monitor counterparty credit exposure 
as of december   the company had in place interest rate swap contracts to fix the floating interest rates on a portion of the borrowings under its debt facilities as summarized below

years changes in the fair value on these interest rate swap contracts will be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations as unrealized gains or losses on interest rate swaps 
as a result of our variable rate indebtedness  our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
however  we utilize interest rate swap agreements to manage the market risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates 
if market interest rates for our variable rate indebtedness averaged basis points more than the weighted average interest rate actually paid during  our interest expense  after considering the effects of our interest rate swap agreements  would have increased  and income before incomes taxes would have decreased  by million for the year ended december  these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowings and interest rate swap agreements 
this analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
credit risk we maintain detailed credit records regarding our customers and set maximum exposure limits for our significant customers based on our review of these records 
credit criteria include  but are not limited to  customer payment history  customer financial position and performance eg  net worth leverage  profitability  trade routes  country of domicile  social and political climate  and the type of  
table of contents and location of  equipment that are to be supplied 
we diligently monitor our customers performance and our lease exposures on an ongoing basis  and our credit management processes are aided by the long payment experience we have with most of our customers and our broad network of long standing relationships in the shipping industry that provide current information about our customers 
in recent years  our credit losses have been minimal 
industry factors that have provided credit protection include the strong growth in the container industry and favorable creditor laws in several countries that are served by most of our large customers 
in addition  we have historically recovered in excess of of our containers that were subject of defaulted contracts and we are able to successfully re market these repossessed containers through our worldwide sales infrastructure 
however  we typically incur operating expenses such as repairs and positioning when containers are recovered after a customer default 
for the year ended december   our five largest customers accounted for approximately of our leasing revenues  with our largest customer accounting for approximately of our leasing revenues 
as of december   approximately of our equipment was on hire to our largest customers 
for the year ended december   another customer accounted for of net investment in finance leases 
the allowance for doubtful accounts includes an estimate of allowances necessary on our accounts receivable
