item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain matters discussed or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k are forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected 
please see forward looking statements on page therefore  the information set forth therein should be carefully considered when evaluating business prospects of the company 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the results reported 
accounting policies are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors reviews and evaluation of specific loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry groups  historical loan loss experiences  the level of classified and nonperforming loans and the results of regulatory examinations 
loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses assumptions and methodologies consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  historical loss experience  and the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
sale of sba loans in calculating gain on the sale of sba loans  the bank performs an allocation based on the relative fair values of the sold portion and retained portions of the loan 
the company assumptions are validated by reference to external market information 
available for sale securities the fair value of most securities classified as available for sale is based on quoted market prices 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are extrapolated from the quoted prices of similar instruments 
deferred tax assets our deferred tax assets are explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has sufficient taxable income from current and prior periods to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
as such  we have provided no valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
operating results for the year ended december   the company reported net income of million or basic and diluted earnings per share  compared with net income of million or basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  and million or basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  the improvement in net income for resulted primarily from an increase of million in net interest income and an increase of million in non interest income  offset  in part  by and increase in provision for credit losses of  and an increase of million in other expense 
see the specific sections below for details regarding these changes 
net income for represented an increase of million compared to primarily due to an increase of million in net interest income and by a decrease of  in provision for credit losses  offset  in part  by an increase of million in other expense 
net interest income and margin net interest income is the principal source of the company s operating earnings 
net interest income is affected by changes in the nature and volume of earning assets held during the year  the rates earned on such assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the following table shows the composition of average earning assets and average funding sources  average yields and rates  and the net interest margin for the three years ended december   and dollars in thousands year ended december  interest interest interest average income yields average income yields average income yields balance expense rates balance expense rates balance expense rates assets interest earning assets loans federal funds sold investment securities total earning assets noninterest earning assets cash and due from banks all other assets total liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing liabilities deposits demand savings time other total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing liabilities demand deposits accrued expenses and other liabilities shareholders equity total net interest income and margin includes amortization of loan fees of million for  million for and million for nonperforming loans have been included in average loan balances 
interest income is reflected on an actual basis  not on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
yields are based on amortized cost 
net of average allowance for credit losses of million and average deferred loan fees of million for  average allowance for credit losses of million and deferred loan fees of million for and average allowance for credit losses of million and deferred loan fees of million for interest differential is affected by changes in volume  changes in rates and a combination of changes in volume and rates 
volume changes are caused by changes in the levels of average earning assets and average interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
rate changes result from changes in yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities 
changes not solely attributable to volume or rates have been allocated to the rate component 
the following table shows the effect on the interest differential of volume and rate changes for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands year ended december  vs

net interest income in was million  comprised of million in interest income and million in interest expense 
the increase of million in net interest income in was primarily due to an increase of million in interest income offset  in part  by an increase of million in interest expense 
net interest income for the year ended december  represented an increase of million over million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income was primarily a result of an increase of million in interest income offset  in part  by an increase of million in interest expense 
the net interest margin net interest income divided by average earning assets was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  and for the decline in net interest margin in compared to was primarily the result of growth in the volume of average interest bearing liabilities and decreased balance sheet leverage 
the improvement in net interest margin in compared to was primarily the result of increases in the prime rate during the year  a shift in the mix of loans toward higher yielding product lines and an increase in federal funds sold 
average loans represented of average earning assets in compared to in and in in addition  in the bank s ratio of average loans to average deposits was  up from in and in reflecting slightly faster loan growth relative to deposit funding 
significant factors affecting net interest income include the volumes and mix of the loan  investment and deposit portfolios and changes in short term interest rates 
the interest rate earned on a majority of the company s assets  specifically the loan portfolio  adjust with changes in short term market rates 
as such  the nature of the company s balance sheet is that  over time as short term interest rates change  income on interest earning assets has a greater impact on net interest income than interest paid on liabilities 
the company s prime rate averaged   and for the years ended   and  respectively 
interest income for the year ended december   the company reported interest income of million  an increase of million or over million reported in the increase in interest income primarily reflects an increase in the volume of average earning assets in compared to average earning assets were million for the year ended december  an increase of million or over million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   the company reported interest income of million  an increase of million or over million reported in the increase in interest income primarily reflects an increase in the volume of average earning assets in compared to average earning assets were million for the year ended december  an increase of million or over million for the year ended december  in addition  the majority of the bank s earning assets have rate structures that re price with movements in short term interest rates  primarily the prime rate and fed funds rate 
during  each of these indices increased by basis points 
interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december   which represented an increase of million or compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense reflects an increase in the rate on and volume of average interest bearing liabilities in compared to average interest bearing liabilities were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or from million for the year ended december  interest expense was million for the year ended december   which represented an increase of million or compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense reflects an increase in the rate on and volume of average interest bearing liabilities in compared to average interest bearing liabilities were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or from million for the year ended december  credit risk and provision for credit losses the bank maintains an allowance for credit losses which is based  in part  on the loss experience of the bank and the california banking industry  the impact of economic conditions within the bank s market area  and  as applicable  the state of california  the value of underlying collateral  loan performance and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is reduced by charge offs and increased by provisions for credit losses charged to operating expense and recoveries of previously charged off loans 
based on management s evaluation of such risks  additions of million  million and million were made to the allowance for credit losses in  and  respectively 
during  the bank had million in charge offs and had recoveries of  as compared to no charge offs and  in recoveries in and  in charge offs and  in recoveries in the allowance for credit losses was million representing of total loans at december  as compared to million representing of total loans at december  and million representing of total loans at december management is of the opinion that the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level adequate for inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
however  the bank s loan portfolio  which includes approximately million in real estate loans  representing approximately of the portfolio  could be adversely affected if california economic conditions and the real estate market in the bank s market area were to weaken 
the effect of such events  although uncertain at this time  could result in an increase in the level of non performing loans and other real estate owned oreo and the level of the allowance for loan losses  which could adversely affect the bank s future growth and profitability

non interest income the following table sets forth the components of other income and the percentage distribution of such income for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands year ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent gain on sale of sba loans service charges on deposit accounts international fee income sba loan servicing fee income warrant income increase in value bank owned life insurance other non interest income non interest income totaled million in  an increase of million or over million in non interest income decreased  or from to non interest income consists primarily of gains recognized on sales of sba loans  service charge income on deposit accounts  and international fee income 
the increase in non interest income in compared to was primarily due to increased sba loan sales  international fee income  and warrant income 
the decrease in non interest income in compared to was primarily due to decreased sba loan sales  partially offset by increases in depositor service charges  international fee income  the amortization of the sba valuation allowance  and warrant income 
revenue from sales of sba loans is dependant on consistent origination and funding of new loan volumes  the timing of which may be impacted  from time to time  by increased competition from other lenders  the relative attractiveness of sba borrowing to other financing options  adjustment of programs by the sba  changes in activities of secondary market participants and  other factors 
gains recognized on sales of sba loans were million in which represented an increase of million or compared to million the same period one year earlier 
the increase was attributed to a higher volume of loans sold during the year

under the factoring program  the bank purchases accounts receivable invoices from its clients and then receives payment directly from the party obligated for the receivable 
in most cases the bank purchases the receivables subject to recourse from the bank s factoring client 
the asset based lending program requires a security interest in all of a client s accounts receivable 
at december   factoring and asset based loans totaled million or of total loans as compared to million or of total loans at december  the sba line of business operates primarily in santa clara county and also maintains loan production offices in sacramento county and southern california 
the bank  as a preferred lender  originates sba loans and participates in the sba a and sba lending programs 
under the a program  a loan is made for commercial or real estate purposes 
the sba guarantees these loans and the guarantee may range from to of the total loan 
in addition  the loan could be collateralized by a deed of trust on real estate 
under the program  the bank lends directly to the borrower and takes a first deed of trust to the subject property

at december   and  the fair value of sba loans exceeded aggregate cost and therefore  sba loans were carried at aggregate cost 
other loans consist primarily of loans to individuals for personal uses  such as installment purchases  overdraft protection loans and a variety of other consumer purposes 
at december   other loans totaled million as compared to million at december  and million at december  allowance for loan losses a consequence of lending activities is the potential for loss 
the amount of such losses will vary from time to time depending upon the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by economic conditions  rising interest rates and the financial experience of the borrowers 
the allowance for loan losses  which provides for the risk of losses inherent in the credit extension process  is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and decreased by the amount of charge offs net of recoveries 
there is no precise method of estimating specific losses or amounts that ultimately may be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
similarly  the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the level of the related provision for loan losses are determined in management s judgment based on consideration of economic conditions borrowers financial condition loan impairment evaluation of industry trends historic losses  migrations and delinquency trends industry and other concentrations loans which are contractually current as to payment terms but demonstrate a higher degree of risk as identified by management continuing evaluation of the performing loan portfolio periodic review and evaluation of problem loans off balance sheet risks assessments by regulators and other third parties in addition to the internal assessment of the loan portfolio  the bank also retains a consultant who performs credit reviews on a regular basis and then provides an assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the federal banking regulators also conduct examinations of the loan portfolio periodically

there were four non accrual loans at december  totaling million as compared to two non accrual loans at december  totaling  and one non accrual loan totaling million at december  included in the non accrual loans at december  was one loan totaling million which was collateralized by undeveloped land 
this loan had an indicated potential loss exposure of approximately  and an impairment reserve was included in the allowance for loan losses 
the other significant non accrual loan was an sba loan that totaled  and was adequately collateralized by undeveloped land 
as such  no specific reserve was required for this loan 
income on such loans is only recognized to the extent that cash is received and where the future collection of principal is probable 
accrual of interest is resumed only when principal and interest are brought fully current and when such loans are considered to be collectible as to both principal and interest 
at december    and  there were no loans past due days or more as to principal or interest and still accruing interest 
at december  there was one commercial property valued at  that was categorized as other real estate owned

funding deposits represent the bank s principal source of funds 
most of the bank s deposits are obtained from professionals  small to medium sized businesses and individuals within the bank s market area 
the bank s deposit base consists of non interest and interest bearing demand deposits  savings and money market accounts and certificates of deposit

at december   the company s capital resources increased million to million from million at december  tier capital increased million to million primarily due to net income of million 
tier capital increased  primarily due to the increase in the allowance for credit losses of million 
the company is subject to capital adequacy guidelines issued by the board of governors and the occ 
the company is required to maintain total capital equal to at least of assets and commitments to extend credit  weighted by risk  of which at least must consist primarily of common equity including retained earnings tier capital and the remainder may consist of subordinated debt  cumulative preferred stock or a limited amount of allowance for credit losses 
certain assets and commitments to extend credit present less risk than others and will be assigned to lower risk weighted categories requiring less capital allocation than the total ratio 
for example  cash and government securities are assigned to a risk weighted category  most home mortgage loans are assigned to a risk weighted category requiring a capital allocation and commercial loans are assigned to a risk weighted category requiring an capital allocation 
as of december   the company s and the bank s total risk based capital ratios were and  respectively  for the company and for the bank at december

the regulations establish five capital categories with the following characteristics well capitalized  consisting of institutions with a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital ratio of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater and which are not operating under an order  written agreement  capital directive or prompt corrective action directive  adequately capitalized  consisting of institutions with a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier risk based capital of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater and which do not meet the definition of a well capitalized institution  undercapitalized  consisting of institutions with a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or a leverage ratio of less than  significantly undercapitalized  consisting of institutions with a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or a leverage ratio of less than  and critically undercapitalized  consisting of institutions with a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 
financial institutions classified as undercapitalized or below are subject to various limitations including  among other matters  certain supervisory actions by bank regulatory authorities and restrictions related to i growth of assets  ii payment of interest on subordinated indebtedness  iii payment of dividends or other capital distributions  and iv payment of management fees to a parent holding company 
the fdicia requires the bank regulatory authorities to initiate corrective action regarding financial institutions that fail to meet minimum capital requirements 
such action may result in orders to  among other matters  augment capital and reduce total assets 
critically undercapitalized financial institutions may also be subject to appointment of a receiver or implementation of a capitalization plan 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity interest rate sensitivity the bank strives to manage its liquidity to provide adequate funds at an acceptable cost to support the borrowing requirements and deposit flows of its customers 
liquidity requirements are evaluated by taking into consideration factors such as deposit concentrations  seasonality and maturities  loan and lease demand  capital expenditures and prevailing and anticipated economic conditions 
the bank s business is generated primarily through customer referrals and employee business development efforts 
the bank is primarily a business and professional bank and  as such  its deposit base is more susceptible to economic fluctuations 
the bank strives to maintain a balanced position of liquid assets to volatile and cyclical deposits 
at december   liquid assets as a percentage of deposits were as compared to in in addition to cash and due from banks  liquid assets include interest bearing deposits with other banks  federal funds sold  and unpledged securities available for sale 
management regularly reviews general economic and financial conditions  both external and internal  and determines whether the positions taken with respect to liquidity and interest rate sensitivity continue to be appropriate 
the bank utilizes a monthly gap report as well as a quarterly simulation model to identify interest rate sensitivity over the short and long term 
management considers the results of these analyses when implementing its interest rate risk management activities  including the utilization of certain interest rate hedges 
the following table sets forth the distribution of repricing opportunities  based on contractual terms  of the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december   the interest rate sensitivity gap ie interest rate sensitive assets less interest rate sensitive liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie interest rate gap divided by interest rate sensitive assets and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
based on the contractual terms of its assets and liabilities  the bank s balance sheet at december  was asset sensitive in terms of its short term exposure to interest rates 
that is  at december  the volume of assets that might reprice within the next year exceeded the volume of liabilities that might reprice 
this position provides a hedge against rising interest rates  but has a detrimental effect during times of rate decreases 
net interest income is negatively impacted by a decline in interest rates and positively impacted by an increase in interest rates 
to partially mitigate the adverse impact of declining rates  the majority of variable rate loans made by the bank have been written with a minimum floor rate 
in addition  the bank has entered into two interest rate swaps to hedge the variable cash flows associated with million of existing variable rate assets
