item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations revenues were  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
this increase of  was primarily the result of an increase in public notice advertising revenues 
the company continued to benefit from the large number of foreclosure sales in california and arizona  for which public notice advertising is required by law 
public notice advertising revenues increased by  the company s smaller newspapers  those other than the los angeles and san francisco daily journals the daily journals  accounted for about of the total public notice advertising revenues 
public notice advertising revenues and related advertising and other service fees constituted about of the company s total revenues 
display advertising revenues decreased by  
classified advertising revenues decreased by  primarily due to a downturn in the employment advertising marketplace 
total circulation revenues decreased by  
the daily journals accounted for about of the company s total circulation revenues 
the court rule and judicial profile services generated about of the total circulation revenues  with the other newspapers and services accounting for the balance 
information system and service revenues increased by  primarily because of increases in sustain s consulting revenues 
the company s revenues derived from sustain s operations constituted about and of the company s total revenues for fiscal and  respectively 
costs and expenses increased by  to  from  due primarily to the reversal of a  contingent liability at sustain in fiscal that had the one time effect of reducing costs and expenses in that year 
ignoring this one time reversal  total costs and expenses increased by  
total personnel costs increased by  to  postage and delivery expenses increased by  mainly because of postal rate increases and pallet sack tray fees recently imposed by the post office 
other general and administrative expenses increased by  primarily due to increased bad debt exposure in the trustee sale marketplace 
the company s expenditures for the development of new sustain software products are highly significant and will materially impact overall results at least through fiscal these costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility of the product has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized  subject to expected recovery 
sustain s internal development costs  which are primarily incremental costs for both employees and outside contractors  aggregated  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
if sustain s internal development programs are not successful  they will significantly and adversely impact the company s ability to maximize its existing investment in the sustain software  to service its existing customers and to compete for new opportunities in the case management software business 
the company s traditional business segment pretax profit increased by  from  to  primarily because of the increase in trustee foreclosure sale notices  partially offset by the decrease in commercial advertising revenues 
sustain s business segment pretax income increased  from a loss of  before last year s reversal of sustain s contingent liability of  to an income of  primarily because of the increased consulting revenues 
whether the large increase in traditional business segment pretax profit will be sustained in fiscal is very much dependant on the number of california and arizona foreclosure sales and the offsetting effect of a continuing decline in display and classified advertising 
at some point  the number of foreclosure sales undoubtedly will slow  and because fewer advertisements will then be required  so will the company s traditional business segment earnings 
whether sustain generates a profit or loss in fiscal likely will be determined based on its consulting revenues  which are subject to uncertainty because they depend on i the timing of the acceptance of the completed consulting tasks  ii the unpredictable needs of sustain s existing customers  and iii sustain s ability to secure new customers 
consolidated net income was  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
on a pretax profit of  for fiscal  the company recorded a tax provision of  on a pretax profit of  for fiscal  the company recorded a tax provision of  which included a reserve for research and development tax credits claimed by the company in prior years 
the internal revenue service has been examining the tax returns for years to and has proposed an assessment that  if upheld  would result in disallowance of about  of previously claimed research and development credits 
these unrecognized tax benefits would have an effective rate impact if recognized 
the company is continuing to contest the issue  and the ultimate resolution of this dispute cannot be ascertained at this time 
net income per share increased to from which included from the reversal of the contingent liability of sustain in the prior year 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company s cash and cash equivalents and us treasury note and bill positions increased by  cash and cash equivalents were used primarily for paying off two real estate loans of  and for the purchase of capital assets of  primarily for computer software and office equipment 
the cash provided by operating activities of  included a net decrease in deferred subscription and other revenues of  proceeds from the sale of subscriptions from newspapers  court rule books and other publications and for software licenses and maintenance and other services are recorded as deferred revenue and are included in earned revenue only when the services are rendered

in general  technological feasibility is achieved when the developer has established the necessary skills  hardware and technology to produce a product and a detailed program design has been a completed  b traced to the product specifications and c reviewed for high risk development issues
