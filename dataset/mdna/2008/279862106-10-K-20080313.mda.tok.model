item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a review of our financial position and results of operations for the periods indicated 
our consolidated financial statements and supplementary information and the related notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a 
general overview edge petroleum corporation edge  we or the company is a houston based independent energy company that focuses its exploration  development  production  acquisition and marketing activities in selected onshore basins of the united states 
in late  we undertook a top level management change and began a shift in strategy from pure exploration  which focused more on prospect generation  to our current strategy which focuses on a balanced program of exploration  exploitation and development and acquisition of oil and gas properties 
we generate revenues  income and cash flows by producing and marketing oil and natural gas produced from our oil and natural gas properties 
we make significant capital expenditures in our exploration  development  and production activities that allow us to continue generating revenue  income and cash flows 
we have also spent considerable efforts on acquisitions  including both corporate and asset acquisitions  which have contributed to our growth in recent years

recently issued accounting pronouncements a discussion of certain recently issued accounting pronouncements that may impact our future results 
industry and economic factors in managing our business  we must deal with many factors inherent in our industry 
first and foremost is the fluctuation of oil and natural gas prices 
historically  oil and natural gas markets have been cyclical and volatile  which makes future price movements difficult to predict 
while our revenues are a function of both production and prices  wide swings in commodity prices have most often had the greatest impact on our results of operations 
we have little ability to predict those prices or to control them without losing some advantage of the upside potential 
although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation  inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business 
in a trend that began in and accelerated during and  commodity prices for oil and natural gas increased significantly 
the higher prices have led to increased activity in the industry and  consequently  rising costs 
these cost trends have put pressure not only on our operating costs but also on our capital costs for we expect this to be a factor in our operations entail significant complexities 
advanced technologies requiring highly trained personnel are utilized in both exploration and production 
even when the technology is properly used  we may still not know conclusively if hydrocarbons will be present or the rate at which they will be produced 
exploration is a high risk activity  often times resulting in no commercially productive reserves being discovered 
these factors  together with increased demand for rigs  equipment  supplies and services  have made it difficult at times for us to further our growth  and made timely execution of our planned activities difficult 
our business  as with other extractive businesses  is a depleting one in which each gas equivalent produced must be replaced or our asset base and capacity to generate revenues in the future will shrink 
the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
we compete with major and diversified energy companies  independent oil and gas businesses and individual operators in exploration  production  marketing and acquisition activities 
in addition  the industry as a whole competes with other businesses that supply energy to industrial and commercial end users 
extensive federal  state and local regulation of the industry significantly affects our operations 
in particular  our activities are subject to stringent operational and environmental regulations 
these regulations have increased the costs of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating and abandoning oil and natural gas wells and related facilities 
these regulations may become more demanding in the future 
approach to the business profitable growth of our business will largely depend upon our ability to successfully find and develop new proved reserves of oil and natural gas in a cost effective manner 
in order to achieve an overall acceptable rate of growth  we seek to maintain a prudent blend of low  moderate and higher risk exploration and development projects 
we have chosen to seek geologic and geographic diversification by operating in multiple basins in order to mitigate risk in our operations 
we also attempt to make selected acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties to augment our growth and provide future drilling opportunities 
in january  we completed the acquisition of certain oil and natural gas properties from a privately held company  as discussed below in acquisitions and divestitures acquisitions 
this was our largest acquisition to date  and we spent much of integrating those assets into our business 
we periodically hedge our exposure to volatile oil and natural gas prices on a portion of our expected production to reduce price risk 
in  we had and of our natural gas and crude oil production  respectively  hedged 
as a result of changes to our forecasted production and the impact of certain asset divestitures  both of which have reduced expected production as compared to that expected at the time we entered into the derivative contracts  we currently have approximately and of our anticipated natural gas and crude oil production  respectively  covered by derivative contracts 
this overhedged position exposes us to greater risk of commodity price increases because we will not have the physical production cash inflows to offset any potential losses incurred on the portion of the contracts that are overhedged 
implementation of our business approach relies on our ability to fund ongoing exploration and development projects with cash flow provided by operating activities and external sources of capital 
as a result of the ongoing strategic assessment process  our board has approved an interim capital expenditure budget for of approximately to million  while we continue to assess the potential sale or merger of the company 
based on current expectations for production volumes and commodity prices  we expect to fund those capital expenditures from internally generated cash from operating activities supplemented by modest borrowings on our credit facility 
any decision to expand our drilling program will depend in large part on the developments and results of our strategic assessment process that is currently underway see outlook section below 
as of march   we have unused borrowing capacity of million 
acquisitions and divestitures acquisitions we have become increasingly active in acquisitions in recent years 
we have looked to acquisitions to enable us to achieve our growth objectives 
acquisitions add meaningful incremental increases in reserves and production and may range in size from acquiring a working interest in non operated producing property to an entire field or company 
unlike drilling capital  which is planned and budgeted  acquisition capital is neither budgeted nor allocated 
specific timing and size of acquisitions cannot be predicted 
any such acquisition could involve the payment by us of a substantial amount of cash or the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares or other securities 
in today s high price environment  where production is providing greater cash flow and earnings to most companies in our industry  identifying quality opportunities is difficult 
january acquisition during the first quarter of  we completed the largest acquisition in our history 
we acquired oil and natural gas properties located in counties in south and southeast texas  exploration rights  leasehold acreage  gathering facilities and gathering pipelines from a privately held company the january acquisition 
the acquired assets include approximately gross net producing wells and an ownership interest in approximately  gross  net developed acres and  gross  net undeveloped acres of leasehold  all as of december  in addition to the properties and related acreage  we acquired certain gathering facilities and ownership of approximately miles of natural gas gathering pipelines and related infrastructure serving certain producing assets in southeast texas 
the pipeline system transports our natural gas as well as third party natural gas 
we also acquired of the seller s option and leasehold rights in an approximate square mile d exploration area with approximately  gross acres of leases and options located in the mission project area in hidalgo county in south texas  with a primary focus on the vicksburg formation 
we acquired a working interest in an approximate square mile d exploration area with approximately  gross acres of leases and options located in the yates ranch hostetter project area in mcmullen and duval counties in south texas 
the mile d area increases our exposure to the middle and deep wilcox trend 
furthermore  this venture allows us to participate in a proposed additional d shoot covering approximately square miles near the yates ranch within the wilcox trend 
we also acquired of the seller s option and leasehold rights in an approximate square mile d exploration area with approximately  gross acres of leases and options in newton county in southeast texas and beauregard parish in louisiana with a focus on prospects in the frio  yegua and wilcox formations at depths ranging between  and  feet 
the final adjusted cash purchase price was million 
pursuant to closing adjustment provisions in the agreements  the base purchase price was subject to adjustment for the results of operations between the january  effective date and the january  closing date 
we financed the purchase price of the january acquisition through public offerings of common and preferred stock see notes and to our consolidated financial statements and borrowings under our credit facility see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we also capitalized approximately million in other direct costs resulting from the acquisition and assumed aro liabilities of million 
the properties acquired are located in south and southeast texas  which we consider to be our main core area of operations 
this acquisition had a substantial impact on our reserves  production revenues  operating costs  and property base 
we have increased staffing levels to manage the growth and help with the integration of these assets into our operations 
during the third quarter  we elected to terminate the exploration venture located in the yates ranch hostetter project area in mcmullen and duval counties in south texas  which was entered into in january as discussed above and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the effective date of termination for this venture was october  in exchange for returning all d seismic data covering the area of mutual interest  the privately held company refunded our payments since january related to this exploration venture 
in october  we received million  including the million initial price paid for the venture and million in expenses related to the venture  which were incurred and paid to the privately held company from january to september chapman ranch acquisition on december   we executed an agreement to acquire certain working interests in the chapman ranch field in nueces county  texas from kerr mcgee oil gas onshore lp kerr mcgee  a wholly owned subsidiary of anadarko petroleum corporation 
in late  we acquired non operated working interests in certain wells in this field 
upon the closing of the kerr mcgee acquisition on december   we assumed the role of operator of the chapman ranch field 
the final adjusted purchase price was approximately million including a previously paid deposit of million as a result of adjustments for the results of operations between the december  effective date and the december  closing date  and other purchase price adjustments 
we financed the purchase price of the kerr mcgee acquisition through million in borrowings under our then existing credit facility 
chapman ranch acquisitions during  we acquired i the stock of a private company  cinco energy corporation cinco  whose primary asset is ownership of working interests in oil and natural gas properties located on the chapman ranch field in south texas closed november  and ii additional working interests in the same field owned by two other private companies closed october  for an aggregate cash purchase price of approximately million of which million was attributable to the stock purchase and million was attributable to the working interest asset purchase 
we allocated approximately million of the total purchase price to the unproved property category 
the properties acquired from these entities are located in nueces county  texas and consisted of six producing wells  one well undergoing completion operations  and one well shut in for evaluation  as well as an ownership interest in approximately  net acres of developed and undeveloped leasehold 
we financed the acquisitions through borrowings under our then existing credit facility 
divestitures we regularly review our asset base for the purpose of identifying non core assets  the disposition of which would increase capital resources available for other activities and create organizational and operational efficiencies 
while we generally do not dispose of assets solely for the purpose of reducing debt  such dispositions can have the result of furthering our objective of financial flexibility through reduced debt levels 
during the first quarter of  we expect to complete the sale of a small group of non core assets located in various areas of texas for an anticipated sale price of approximately million 
during january  we divested a portion of our interest in a louisiana well for million 
during  we sold our buckeye properties in live oak county  texas for million 
during  we had no divestitures 
assessment of strategic alternatives on december   we announced the hiring of a financial advisor to assist our board of directors with an assessment of strategic alternatives 
on february   we provided an update on the strategic assessment process  which includes a thorough review and assessment of our strengths and weaknesses  competitive position and asset base  reporting that after careful analysis  management and our board of directors believed that the best route to maximizing stockholder value at that time was to focus on an assessment of a potential merger or sale of edge 
we are working diligently to explore this alternative 
a decision on any particular course of action has not been made and there can be no assurance that our board of directors will authorize any transaction 
while that process is continuing  we intend to operate edge in a manner designed to capture the most value possible for our stockholders 
outlook we successfully completed a large acquisition in the first quarter of  which added significant reserves in our core area in texas 
this acquisition also required a great deal of our resources to integrate the acquired properties during the year 
during the first quarter of  we expect to complete the sale of a small group of non core assets located in various parts of texas and intend to use the proceeds of such sale to pay down a portion of our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility 
during  a total of wells were logged with apparent successes  for an overall success rate of approximately 
given the backdrop of the ongoing strategic assessment process  we will be operating under an interim capital spending budget in while we continue to assess the potential merger or sale of the company 
this interim program  which could be supplemented quickly  calls for the drilling of to wells to  net during  primarily in south texas  and to a lesser extent in southeast new mexico  and complemented by selected expenditures for land and seismic 
the interim program provides for total capital spending in the range of to million 
we had a disappointing start to our arkansas shale program where fracture stimulation during the completion of our initial wells caused communication with an underlying water bearing zone 
in  we drilled seven wells net in this area  six net of which were apparent successes  but five wells had operations temporarily suspended at year end many of the planned wells have been deferred and some of the reserves that we originally expected to be classified as proved were moved to non proved category 
due to the ongoing strategic assessment process  we have deferred additional drilling in this area 
in order to manage our recent growth  we increased our headcount from employees as of december  to employees as of december   resulting in increased g a costs for we do not expect to increase staffing levels during we apply mark to market accounting treatment to our outstanding derivative contracts  rather than cash flow hedge accounting treatment  and therefore significant volatility from the changes in fair value of those outstanding contracts have impacted our earnings in see note to our consolidated financial statements 
see approach to the business above for information regarding our current derivatives position in light of recent changes in expected production and dispositions 
our outlook and the expected results described above are both subject to change based upon factors that include  but are not limited to  drilling results  commodity prices  the results of our strategic assessment process  access to capital  the acquisitions market and factors referred to in forward looking information 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  contingent assets and liabilities and the related disclosures in the accompanying financial statements 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
all other significant accounting policies that we employ are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion presents information about the nature of our most critical accounting estimates  our assumptions or approach used and the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate 
nature of critical estimate item oil and natural gas reserves our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the economics of producing the reserves may change and therefore the estimate of proved reserves also may change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  our reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
assumptions approach used units of production method to amortize our oil and natural gas properties the quantity of reserves could significantly impact our depletion expense 
any reduction in proved reserves without a corresponding reduction in capitalized costs will increase the depletion rate 
ceiling test the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties requires a quarterly calculation of a limitation on capitalized costs  often referred to as a full cost ceiling test 
the ceiling is the discounted present value of our estimated total proved reserves using a discount rate adjusted for taxes and the impact of cash flow hedges on pricing  if cash flow hedge accounting is applied 
the ceiling test calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are to be used in calculating the discounted present value of our estimated total proved reserves 
however  if prices increase subsequent to the balance sheet date but before the filing date  sec guidelines allow a company to elect to use the subsequent date s higher prices in calculating the full cost ceiling 
we made this election for the third and fourth quarters of to the extent that our capitalized costs net of accumulated depletion and deferred taxes exceed the ceiling  the excess must be written off to expense 
once incurred  this impairment of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil and natural gas prices increase 
a ceiling test impairment could result in a significant loss for a reporting period  however  future depletion expense would be correspondingly reduced 
our average oil and natural gas prices at the balance sheet date of december  were per barrel and per mmbtu 
using these prices  we would have recorded an impairment of million million net of tax 
we elected to use subsequent pricing as of january  of per barrel of oil and per mmbtu 
as a result  no ceiling test impairment was required at december  during the year ended december   we recorded a ceiling test impairment of million million  net of tax 
no such impairment was required in the year ended december  effect if different assumptions used units of production method to amortize our oil and natural gas properties a increase or decrease in reserves would have decreased or increased  respectively  our depletion expense for the year by approximately 
ceiling test factors that contribute to a ceiling test impairment include the price used to calculate the reserve limitation threshold and reserve quantities 
a significant reduction in prices at a measurement date could trigger a full cost ceiling impairment 
such a reduction at september  was primarily responsible for our impairment recorded during the third quarter of we elected to use pricing as of january  for the year end ceiling test  as discussed above  and calculated a cushion of million  net of tax 
using prices in effect as of december   we would have recorded an impairment of million  net of tax 
a increase in the year end prices would have eliminated that impairment and a decrease in prices would have increased that impairment by approximately 
had we applied cash flow hedge accounting to our outstanding derivative contracts  the impairment at december  would have only been minimally impacted 
a increase in reserve volume would have eliminated the impairment and a decrease in reserve volume would have increased the impairment calculated at december  by approximately 
as noted above  we used subsequent date pricing to determine our ceiling test 
should commodity prices decrease significantly in or we further revise our reserve quantities  the possibility of a ceiling test impairment at a future date exists 
nature of critical estimate item asset retirement obligations we have certain obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  the costs associated with this activity were capitalized to the full cost pool and charged to income through depletion 
sfas no 
significantly changed the method of accruing for costs an entity is legally obligated to incur related to the retirement of fixed assets asset retirement obligations or aro 
primarily  sfas no 
requires us to estimate asset retirement costs for all of our assets  adjust those costs for inflation to the forecast abandonment date  discount that amount using a credit adjusted risk free rate back to the date we acquired the asset or obligation to retire the asset  and record an aro liability in that amount with a corresponding addition to our asset value 
when new obligations are incurred  ie new well drilled or acquired  we add a layer to the aro liability 
we accrete the liability layers quarterly using the applicable period end effective credit adjusted risk free rates for each layer 
should either the estimated life or the estimated abandonment costs of a property change upon our quarterly review  a new calculation is performed using the same methodology of taking the abandonment cost and inflating it forward to its abandonment date and then discounting it back to the present using our credit adjusted risk free rate 
the carrying value of the asset retirement obligation is adjusted to the newly calculated value  with a corresponding offsetting adjustment to the asset retirement cost included in the full cost pool  therefore  abandonment costs will almost always approximate the estimate 
when well obligations are relieved by sale of the property or plugging and abandoning the well  the related liability and asset costs are removed from our balance sheet 
assumptions approach used estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future  and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are regulatory  political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
inherent in the estimate of the present value calculation of our aros are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate settlement amounts  inflation factors  credit adjusted risk free rates  timing of settlement  and changes in the legal  regulatory  environmental and political environments 
effect if different assumptions used since there are so many variables in estimating aros  we attempt to limit the impact of management s judgment on certain of these variables by using input of qualified third parties 
we engage independent engineering firms to evaluate our properties annually 
we use the remaining estimated useful life from the year end reserve reports by our independent reserve engineers in estimating when abandonment could be expected for each property 
we utilize a three year average rate for inflation to diminish any significant volatility that may be present in the short term 
we expect to see our calculations impacted significantly if interest rates are volatile  as the credit adjusted risk free rate is one of the variables used on a quarterly basis 
we have developed a standard cost estimate based on historical costs  industry quotes and depth of wells 
unless we expect a well s plugging to be significantly different than a normal abandonment  we use this estimate 
the resulting estimate  after application of a discount factor and some significant calculations  could differ from actual results  despite all our efforts to make an accurate estimate 
nature of critical estimate item income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we have recorded a deferred tax asset and liability to account for the expected future tax benefits and consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
there are several items that result in deferred tax asset and liability impact to the balance sheet  but the largest of which are income taxes and the impact of net operating loss nol carryforwards 
we routinely assess our ability to use all of our nol carryforwards that resulted from substantial income tax deductions  prior year losses and acquisitions 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  it is reduced by a valuation allowance to remove the benefit of those nol carryforwards from our financial statements 
additionally  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin we have recorded a liability of million associated with uncertain tax positions 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we are required to determine whether it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than percent that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position in order to record any financial statement benefit 
if that step is satisfied  then we must measure the tax position to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
assumptions approach used numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income and tax return filing positions that we take  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
we are not currently required to pay any federal income taxes because of an anticipated loss generated during the current year 
effect if different assumptions used our in house tax department  along with consultation from an independent public accounting firm used in tax consultation  continually evaluate complicated tax law requirements and their effect on our current and future tax liability and our tax filing positions 
despite our attempt to make an accurate estimate  the ultimate utilization of our nol carryforwards is highly dependent upon our actual production  the realization of taxable income in future periods  internal revenue code section limitations  and potential tax elections 
if we estimate that some or all of our nol carryforwards are more likely than not going to expire or otherwise not be utilized to reduce future tax  we would record a valuation allowance to remove the benefit of those nol carryforwards from our financial statements 
our liability for uncertain tax positions is dependent upon our judgment on the amount of financial statement benefit that an uncertain tax position will realize upon ultimate settlement and on the probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement of an uncertain tax position using the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date to establish the appropriate amount of financial statement benefit 
to the extent that a valuation allowance or uncertain tax position is established or increased or decreased during a period  we may be required to include an expense or benefit within tax expense in the income statement 
nature of critical estimate item derivative and hedging activities due to the instability of oil and natural gas prices  we may enter into  from time to time  price risk management transactions eg  swaps  collars and floors related to our expected oil and natural gas production to seek to achieve a more predictable revenue  as well as to reduce exposure from commodity price fluctuations 
while these transactions are intended to be economic hedges of price risk  different accounting treatment may apply depending on if they qualify for cash flow hedge accounting 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended  all derivatives  other than those that meet the normal purchases and sales exception  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
see items and business and properties derivatives 
hedge contracts we formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used for hedging are expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged transactions 
the ongoing measurement of effectiveness determines whether the change in fair value is deferred through other comprehensive income oci on the balance sheet or recorded immediately in revenue on the income statement 
the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of hedge contracts is recorded initially in oci 
when the hedged production is sold  the realized gains and losses on the hedge contracts are removed from oci and recorded in revenue 
ineffective portions of the changes in the fair value of the hedge contracts are recognized in revenue as they occur 
the cash flows resulting from settlement of these hedge transactions are included in cash flows from operating activities on the statement of cash flows 
while the hedge contract is outstanding  the fair value may increase or decrease until settlement of the contract 
in the event it is determined that the use of a particular derivative may not be or has ceased to be effective in pursuing a hedging strategy  hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively 
during the first quarter of  we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting treatment applied to our natural gas contracts  therefore  all contracts are utilizing mark to market accounting treatment rather than cash flow hedge accounting treatment at december   as discussed below 
derivative contracts for transactions accounted for using mark to market accounting treatment  the change in the fair value of the derivative contract is reflected in revenue immediately  and not deferred through oci  and there is no measurement of effectiveness 
assumptions approach used estimating the fair values of derivative instruments requires complex calculations  including the use of a discounted cash flow technique  estimates of risk and volatility  and subjective judgment in selecting an appropriate discount rate 
in addition  the calculations use future market commodity prices  which although posted for trading purposes  are merely the market consensus of forecasted price trends 
the results of the fair value calculations cannot be expected to represent exactly the fair value of our commodity hedges 
we currently obtain the fair value of our positions from our counterparties 
our practice of relying on our counterparties who are more specialized and knowledgeable in preparing these complex calculations reduces our management s input and approximates the fair value of the contracts  as the fair value obtained from our counterparties would be the cost to us to terminate a contract at that point in time 
due to the fact that we apply mark to market accounting treatment  the offset to the balance sheet asset or liability  or the change in fair value of the contracts  is included in revenue on the income statement rather than in oci on the balance sheet 
effect if different assumptions used at december   a change in the commodity price per unit  as long as the price is either above the ceiling or below the floor price  would cause the fair value total of our derivative financial instruments to increase or decrease by approximately million 
had we applied cash flow hedge accounting treatment to all of our derivative contracts outstanding at december   our net income available to common stockholders for the year would have been million 
results of operations this section includes discussion of our  and results of operations 
we are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration  development  acquisition and production of crude oil and natural gas properties in the united states 
our resources and assets are managed and our results reported as one operating segment 
we conduct our operations primarily along the onshore united states gulf coast  with our primary emphasis in texas  mississippi  new mexico and louisiana

production volumes mcfe natural gas natural gas liquids crude oil total our revenue is sensitive to changes in prices received for our products 
a substantial portion of our production is sold at prevailing market prices  which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control 
imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas can have a dramatic effect on the prices we receive for our production 
political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply  while the economy  weather and other factors outside of our control could impact demand

natural gas revenue the overall increase in production for compared to resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately million based on comparable period pre derivative prices 
average prices received in were slightly lower than  resulting in decreased revenue of approximately million based on current period production 
the overall increase in production for compared to resulted in an increase in revenue of approximately million based on comparable period pre hedge derivative prices 
excluding the effect of hedge and derivative activity  the average natural gas sales price for production in was lower than  which resulted in decreased revenue of approximately million based on production 
average natural gas production increased from mmcf d in and to mmcf d in to mmcf d in the growth in natural gas production in was primarily due to the addition of new assets acquired in the january acquisition and to a lesser extent the additional assets acquired in the chapman ranch field in december of additionally  new wells drilled in the vicksburg and deep frio project areas of texas and in southeast new mexico contributed to the growth 
partially offsetting these increases were declines in mississippi  some of our queen city and lobo properties in texas  and on older wells in the southeast new mexico project area 
production increases in as compared to were attributable to significant drilling at our queen city and southeast new mexico properties  as well as acquisitions  including the chapman ranch field in late and additional working interests in the chapman ranch field in december of  for which the impact was more noticeable in partially offsetting the increases in production in as compared to were natural declines in production in our older properties including gato creek  encinitas and miller 
ngl revenue revenue from the sale of ngls remained flat for the year ended december  over the same period in  but increased significantly for the year ended december  average realized prices have increased  which positively impacted revenues 
the substantial increase in production in is partially attributable to the january acquisition 
in late and early  we entered into natural gas processing agreements for our chapman ranch production and our non operated queen city production in jim hogg county  which agreements contributed a portion of the increase in ngl production in as compared to the decrease in production from to is mainly attributed to natural production declines at our encinitas  gato creek and louisiana properties 
crude oil and condensate revenue revenue from the sale of oil and condensate  excluding derivative activity  has steadily increased from to and to as a result of both increases in production and average realized prices 
crude oil prices have increased in the marketplace and we have realized the benefit of those increases in our unhedged revenue 
production volumes for oil and condensate increased to  bbls d for the year ended december  from bbls d for the same period in and from bbls d for the same period in the growth in crude oil and condensate in was primarily due to the addition of new assets acquired in the january acquisition and to a lesser extent the additional assets acquired in the chapman ranch field in december of additionally  new wells in the vicksburg  deep frio and southeast new mexico project areas contributed to the growth 
partially offsetting these increases were declines in mississippi  some of our queen city and lobo properties in texas  and on older wells in the southeast new mexico project area 
the increase in as compared to was from production on new wells drilled in our queen city and southeast new mexico projects  as well as from the chapman ranch field properties acquired in late  partially offset by declines in production from our miller  encinitas  and gato creek properties 
derivatives our hedging and derivative contracts resulted in a net loss in and and a net gain in during the first quarter of  we discontinued cash flow hedge accounting treatment applied to our natural gas collars 
this change in accounting treatment affects the comparability of the periods see note to our consolidated financial statements because the change in fair market value of the natural gas hedge contracts in was deferred through oci on the balance sheet rather than presented in total revenue on the income statement  as presented in and the volume and price contract terms vary from period to period and therefore interact differently with the changing pricing environment 
while we are unable to predict the market prices  we enter into contracts that we expect will protect us in the event of significant downturns in the market  which has proven to be a benefit to us in and for natural gas 
natural gas prices declined in relation to our derivative contracts in place  resulting in cash settlement inflows from our hedge counterparties to offset the lower prices received for our physical production 
the opposite was true of our crude oil derivative contracts in and the following table summarizes the various components of the total gain or loss on hedging and derivatives for each of the periods indicated and the impact each component had on our realized prices year ended december  per unit per unit per unit in thousands  except prices natural gas contract settlements mcf   crude oil contract settlements bbl mark to market reversal of prior period unrealized change in fair value of gas derivative contracts mcf  mark to market unrealized change in fair value of gas derivative contracts mcf   mark to market reversal of prior period unrealized change in fair value of oil derivative contracts bbl mark to market unrealized change in fair value of oil derivative contracts bbl  gain loss on hedging and derivatives mcfe  should crude oil or natural gas prices increase or decrease from the current levels  it could materially impact our revenues 
our physical sales of these commodities are vulnerable to the volatility of market price movements 
therefore  we enter into contracts covering our anticipated production to ensure certain revenues that we expect will allow us to plan our business activities 
in a high price environment  hedged positions could result in lost opportunities if there is a ceiling in place  thus lowering our effective realized prices on hedged production  but in an environment of falling prices  these transactions offer some pricing protection for hedged production 
our current derivative position exceeds our expected production  therefore we could incur realized cash losses if oil and natural gas commodity prices increase significantly during  see approach to the business above 
costs and operating expenses the table below presents a detail of expenses for the periods indicated december  increase decrease vs 
vs 
in thousands  except percentages oil and natural gas operating expenses    severance and ad valorem taxes    depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion oil and natural gas property and equipment   other assets aro accretion impairment of oil and natural gas properties  general and administrative expenses bad debt expense general and administrative expenses    total operating expenses    other expense  net   income tax expense benefit    preferred stock dividends  not meaningful oil and natural gas operating expenses oil and natural gas operating expenses in were significantly impacted by the january acquisition  which contributed of the increase in costs averaging per mcfe for the year from to the increasing cost structure in as compared to resulted from added costs for compression  expensed workovers and salt water disposal as well as inflation in our industry 
the increase in expenses was also affected to a lesser extent by the chapman ranch acquisition in december of the results were impacted by increased costs on our states  gato creek and southeast new mexico properties 
we also experienced increases in  as compared to  due to the chapman ranch properties acquired late in  but costs for this area were not as high as expected due to delays in our chapman ranch drilling program during operating expenses averaged per mcfe  per mcfe and per mcfe for the years ended december   and  respectively 
severance and ad valorem taxes severance taxes are levied directly on our non hedge revenue dollars  so the increasing trend is consistent with our increasing revenue 
partially offsetting the increase from revenues is a declining rate realized 
the severance tax rate realized in the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the rate realized changes as a result of the changing mix of our production locations 
in recent years  we have expanded our production to areas outside of texas  which imposes a high tax rate of approximately of the revenue dollar 
additionally  in and  we received severance tax abatements on certain chapman ranch field locations acquired late in and as a result of these properties qualifying for high cost gas certification  which lowered our overall severance tax rate 
ad valorem costs have increased due to the addition of properties acquired in january if not for the january acquisition  ad valorem tax expense would have decreased by approximately as compared to the year ended december  on an equivalent basis  severance and ad valorem taxes averaged per mcfe  per mcfe and per mcfe for the years ended december   and  respectively 
depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a and accretion expense full cost depletion on our oil and natural gas properties has increased as a result of both rate and volume increases in recent years 
depletion expense on a unit of production basis for the years ended december   and was per mcfe  per mcfe and per mcfe  respectively 
the depletion rate has increased in recent years due to significant property costs for both drilling and exploration activities as well as our acquisition program without a corresponding increase in reserves 
additionally  negative revisions to our proved reserves at year end increased our depletion rate 
depreciation expense of other assets is related to our executive office furniture and fixtures  computer equipment and software and pipelines acquired in the january acquisition that transport third party gas 
depreciation expense related to other assets increased from to due to new assets needed for growth of our executive offices  including leasehold improvements for our office expansion  new office furniture and equipment and computers and software 
our depreciation expense related to other assets increased from to because we fully depreciated computer software programs during the year and then replaced those same programs with new  upgraded technology 
accretion expense on our aro liability increased in and due to the addition of new obligations associated with wells added each year  including the large acquisition completed in january accretion expense is calculated using the interest method of allocation  which calculates interest on the cumulative balance such that the interest increases with each subsequent period 
impairment of oil and natural gas properties we recorded a non cash full cost ceiling test impairment of oil and natural gas properties in the amount of million million  net of tax during as a result of declines in natural gas prices at september  no such impairment was recorded in or bad debt expense during  we recorded bad debt expense of million related to the ongoing golden prairie enron dispute that we no longer felt we could collect as we exhausted our efforts on this matter 
this was partially offset by a reduction of bad debt expense of million for a receivable that was reserved as uncollectible in  but recovered during the fourth quarter of during  we recorded  of bad debt expense to increase our allowance for outstanding receivables from joint interest owners 
there was no bad debt expense recorded in historically we have not experienced significant credit losses on our receivables  but we cannot ensure that similar such losses may not be realized in the future 
general and administrative g a expenses the majority of the increase in g a expense over the periods presented is the result of increasing our staffing levels 
our salary and benefits comprise approximately of total g a expense each year 
we added new employees during the year ended december  and seven during the year ended december  as a result of our continued growth 
a portion of the increase in g a expense is attributable to stock based compensation costs related to restricted stock awards granted over the past three years  which has increased from million in to million in and to million in this gradual increase in compensation for restricted stock awards is related to additional restricted stock awards granted in conjunction with our increase in employees from to as well as the vesting of additional tranches of grants already awarded to existing employees 
other cost increases during include rent expense for our corporate office expansion and professional service fees  offset by decreased costs for our board of directors and franchise taxes 
in  we experienced higher legal fees in conjunction with increased legal activity in texas and louisiana 
also in  we paid a franchise tax settlement to the state of texas of approximately million and a litigation settlement 
g a costs were partially offset by increased capitalized g a and overhead reimbursement fees which reduce total g a costs 
we capitalized million  million and million of general and administrative costs in  and  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  overhead reimbursement fees reduced g a costs by approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
g a expenses  excluding non cash share based compensation costs  on a unit of production basis for the years ended december   and were per mcfe  per mcfe and per mcfe  respectively 
upon adoption of sfas no 
r  as discussed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements  during  we recorded  in compensation expense for stock options that had not vested as of adoption of sfas no 
r 
those options have since vested and we have not issued new options since therefore  we did not record any stock option expense in nor do we expect to record expense related to stock options in the near future 
in  in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we discontinued the application of fin accounting treatment for repriced options and began recording compensation expense for stock options that had not vested as of the date of adoption of sfas no 
r 
prior to  fin accounting treatment was applied to our repriced options  which calls for a non cash charge to compensation expense if the price of our common stock on the last trading day of a reporting period is greater than the exercise price of certain repriced options 
fin could also result in a credit to compensation expense to the extent that the trading price declines from the trading price as of the end of the prior period  but not below the exercise price of the options 
pre  we adjusted compensation expense upward or downward monthly based on the trading price at the end of each such period 
we were required to report under this rule as a result of non qualified stock options granted to employees and directors in prior years and repriced in may of  as well as certain newly issued options in conjunction with the repricing 
a fin charge on our repriced stock options was required in as a result of our stock price exceeding the exercise price of those repriced options 
the average price at december  that was used to calculate this expense was per share 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
r on january   we discontinued the application of fin  and hence there will not be any additional adjustments for charges or credits to compensation expense related to repriced options 
other income expense for the years ended december  and  we only capitalized a portion of our interest expense 
but in the year ended december   we capitalized of our interest expense because our unproved property balance exceeded our weighted average debt balance 
at december   and our unproved property balance was million  million  and million  respectively 
we incurred higher gross interest costs for the year ended december  than for and due to higher commitment fees on our credit facility and higher outstanding debt balances  as well as a one time commitment fee of million paid to our lender for the unused bridge loan facility in january see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the year ended december  also includes interest paid on our franchise tax settlement in of approximately  interest costs on the franchise tax settlement were not subject to capitalization 
the table below details our interest expense  capitalized interest and weighted average debt for each of the periods indicated for the year ended december  in thousands gross interest    less capitalized interest    interest expense  net   weighted average debt    included in other income expense is amortization of deferred loan costs of million associated with our credit facility for the year ended december  and million associated with our then existing credit facility for the years ended december  and these costs were higher in due to the higher costs associated with our current credit facility compared to our prior credit facility 
also included in other income expense was interest income  which totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the interest is earned on daily cash invested in overnight money market funds 
we have had increased cash on hand in recent years providing for the increased interest income 
income tax expense benefit we are subject to state and federal income taxes and although we were recently generating taxable income for financial reporting purposes  we are not in a federal income tax paying position as a result of deducting intangible drilling costs idc that reduce our taxable income for income tax purposes and nol carryforwards that offset any remaining taxable income 
a deferred income tax provision of million was recorded for the year ended december  a deferred income tax benefit of million and a provision of million were recorded for the years ended december  and  respectively 
due to changes in amounts of permanent tax differences  including meals and entertainment and other expenses  our effective tax rate also changes from time to time 
the effective rate was for the year ended december   as compared to in and in as of december   approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards have been accumulated or acquired that will begin to expire in we were required to make alternative minimum tax payments of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  but do not expect any alternative minimum tax liability in preferred stock dividends our board of directors declared quarterly dividends on our series a cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock in the preferred stock was issued in connection with a public offering in january  therefore no comparable dividends were paid in or earnings loss per share for the years ended december  and  we reported a net loss available to common shareholders as compared to net income available to common shareholders in the same period in basic weighted average shares outstanding increased from approximately million at december  to million at december  and to million at december  there were minimal increases due to options exercised and vesting of restricted stock during each of these periods  but the primary cause of the significant increase from to was the public offering of common stock in january that was made to partially finance the january acquisition 
we issued approximately million shares of common stock 
we also issued approximately million shares of series a cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock  which  when converted  have an anti dilutive effect of approximately million shares of common stock  and therefore  are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  diluted earnings per share calculations in loss periods do not include certain shares that would result in an anti dilutive effect on earnings per share 
liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing source of capital is the cash flow generated from our operating activities supplemented by borrowings under our credit facility 
net cash generated from operating activities is a function of production volumes and commodity prices  both of which are inherently volatile and unpredictable  as well as operating efficiency and costs 
our business  as with other extractive businesses  is a depleting one in which each gas equivalent unit produced must be replaced or our asset base and capacity to generate revenues in the future will shrink 
our overall expected future production decline is estimated to be approximately per year 
less predictable than production declines from our proved reserves is the impact of constantly changing oil and natural gas prices on cash flows 
we attempt to mitigate the price risk with our hedging program 
reserves and production volumes are influenced  in part  by the amount of future capital expenditures 
in turn  capital expenditures are influenced by many factors including drilling results  oil and natural gas prices  industry conditions  prices  availability of goods and services and the extent to which oil and natural gas properties are acquired 
our primary cash requirements are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties  payment of preferred stock dividends and the repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt 
we attempt to fund our exploration and development activities primarily through internally generated cash flows and budget capital expenditures based largely on projected cash flows 
we routinely adjust capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices  drilling and acquisition costs  and cash flow 
we typically have funded acquisitions from borrowings under our credit facility  cash flow from operations and sales of common stock and preferred stock 
significant changes to working capital may affect our liquidity in the short term 
we now pay quarterly dividends on our preferred stock  which is a new and ongoing use of our cash 
the increase in our derivative instrument liability is indicative of potential future cash settlement outflows on our outstanding oil  and to a lesser extent natural gas  derivative positions  which are scheduled to settle in future months 
the fair market value represents the potential settlement for those contracts if the market prices remain unchanged  but should commodity prices increase or decrease  the fair value of those outstanding contracts would change and the settlements at maturity would also change 
when our derivatives result in cash settlement outflows  we receive higher cash inflows on the sale of unhedged production at those higher market prices  thus providing us with additional funds with which to cover at least a portion of any derivative payments that may come due in the future 
this will not be true  however  for the portion of our production that is overhedged 
currently we expect to have of our anticipated natural gas production and of our anticipated crude oil production hedged in as a result of a decrease in expected future production since the time we entered into our derivative positions 
we have no derivatives covering our substantial production of ngls  which have historically received a price of approximately of our realized crude oil price 
as a result  even though we do not benefit from increases in oil prices and might suffer increased losses as oil prices increase  those increased losses may be partially offset by increases in our ngl revenues 
see approach to the business above 
we have historically used our credit facility to supplement any deficiencies between operating cash flow and capital expenditures 
our outstanding debt balance at march  was million  primarily due to the funding of our acquisition program  principally the and acquisitions in the chapman ranch field and the january acquisition 
we typically do not rely on the sale of assets as a source of cash  but will realize approximately million related to the sale of several non core assets during the first quarter of  and we expect to use the proceeds to reduce outstanding debt 
we have reduced our planned capital spending for as compared to recent years 
as a result of the ongoing strategic assessment process  our board of directors has approved an interim capital budget 
initially that budget is expected to be approximately to million and is expected to be less than our cash flow from operating activities  thereby allowing us to reduce outstanding debt as we move through the year 
during and  we realized increased cash flows as a result of our public and private stock offerings 
we have also realized cash flows from the exercises of options and warrants to acquire shares of our common stock  although we typically do not rely on proceeds from the exercise of warrants and stock options to sustain our business  as the timing of their exercise is unpredictable 
at december  and  we had certain options outstanding and exercisable for shares of our common stock 
we had cash and cash equivalents at december  of million consisting primarily of short term money market investments  as compared to million at december  working capital was million as of december   as compared to million at december  for the year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by financing activities   net cash provided by operating activities the significant increase in cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  compared to and was primarily due to the january acquisition 
the major source of funds was revenue of million  partially offset by cash operating expenses of million and general and administrative expenses of million 
contributing to the decrease in the level of cash provided by operating activities in was the net timing effects of receipts of accounts receivable payments of accrued liabilities and accounts payables 
net cash generated from operating activities is a function of production and commodity prices  which are inherently volatile and unpredictable  and costs of operating our business and properties 
in an effort to reduce the volatility realized on commodity prices  we enter into derivative instruments 
due to lower natural gas market pricing  we realized a benefit in cash settlement gains of million and million on our natural gas derivatives during and  respectively 
partially offsetting these cash inflows were cash settlement losses of million on our crude oil derivatives during during  we recorded cash settlement losses on both natural gas and crude oil derivatives of million and million  respectively 
overall  oil and gas production revenue  including the effects of derivatives and hedging  for increased over and over although fluctuations in commodity prices have been the primary reason for our short term changes in cash flow from operating activities  increased production volumes also impacted us in and our business  as with other extractive businesses  is a depleting one in which each gas equivalent produced must be replaced or our asset base and capacity to generate revenues in the future will shrink 
our ability to prevent shrinkage will be affected in the future by the successes and or failures of our exploration  production and acquisition activities 
for these reasons  we put in place an annual budget that is based upon our forecasts for production  revenues and costs 
those forecasts are reviewed and updated regularly by management and our capital budget is adjusted as warranted 
in the event such capital resources are not available to us  our drilling and other activities may be curtailed 
see items a 
risk factors our operations have significant capital requirements which  if not met will hinder operations 
net cash used in investing activities we reinvest a substantial portion of our cash flows in our drilling  acquisition  land and geophysical activities 
as a result  we used million in investing activities during acquisition costs of million were related to the january acquisition  which was the largest in our history 
capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of gross wells  of which were apparently successful and recompletions 
higher net capital costs per well in as compared to prior years were due to higher average working interests and higher gross costs per well in arkansas and deep frio project areas as compared to wells drilled in previous years 
general increases in costs of services as a result of higher commodity price environment also contributed 
other spending included million attributable to land holdings  capitalized g a and interest and million for seismic data and other geological and geophysical expenditures 
the remaining capital expenditures were associated with computer hardware and office furniture and equipment 
we also received million during early from the sale of a portion of our interest in a louisiana well 
during the year ended december   we used million in investing activities 
capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of gross wells  of which were apparently successful 
acquisition costs totaled million  mainly related to the acquisition of additional interests in the chapman ranch field late in and final adjustments to the cinco purchase price 
other spending included million attributable to land holdings  capitalized g a and interest and million for increased seismic data and other geological and geophysical expenditures 
drilling advances to the operator of our queen city properties decreased in by approximately million 
we also received million during from the sale of our buckeye properties 
the remaining capital expenditures were associated with computer hardware and office furniture and equipment 
during the year ended december   we used million in investing activities 
capital expenditures of million were attributable to the drilling of gross wells  of which were apparently successful 
acquisition costs related to the private company corporate acquisition totaled million  net of cash acquired  and other acquisition costs totaled million  mainly related to the chapman ranch field asset acquisition 
other spending included million attributable to land holdings  capitalized g a and interest and million for increased seismic data and other geological and geophysical expenditures 
drilling advances to the operator of our queen city properties amounted to million during the remaining capital expenditures were associated with computer hardware  office furniture and equipment for the expansion into additional office space 
we will be operating under an interim capital spending budget in while we continue to assess the potential sale or merger of the company 
this interim program  which could be supplemented quickly  calls for the drilling of to wells to  net during  primarily in south texas  and to a lesser extent in southeast new mexico  complemented by selected expenditures for land and seismic 
the interim program is estimated to have total capital spending in the range of to million 
net cash provided by financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities were significantly impacted by the public offerings of common stock and preferred stock completed in january in connection with the newly issued preferred stock  we paid million in dividends to preferred shareholders during we also refinanced our prior credit facility borrowings of million with our current credit facility  which we borrowed against to partially finance the january acquisition 
in total  we had million in borrowings and million in repayments during in connection with our credit facility  we incurred loan costs of approximately million 
in addition  we received approximately  in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to options exercised in during the year ended december   cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million 
we had million in borrowings and million in repayments under our prior credit facility 
we incurred loan costs of approximately million in amending our prior credit facility 
in addition  we received million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to options exercised in for the year ended december   cash flows provided by financing activities totaled million 
we had million in borrowings and million in repayments under a prior credit facility 
we incurred loan costs of approximately  in amending a prior credit facility 
in addition  we received million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to options exercised in the majority of those proceeds are related to the january underwriter exercise of the over allotment option to the december common stock offering 
the funds generated from that exercise were used to reduce debt early in credit facility on december   we amended our third amended and restated credit agreement the prior credit facility  which we had originally entered into in march effective december  and previously amended on december  the prior credit facility permitted borrowings up to the lesser of i the borrowing base and ii million 
effective december  the borrowing base under the prior credit facility was increased from million to million as a result of acquisitions and our drilling activities since the last redetermination 
based on the increase  our available borrowing capacity at december  was million 
the prior credit facility s scheduled maturity date was march   and it was secured by substantially all of our assets 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  on january   we entered into a fourth amended and restated credit agreement the agreement for a new revolving credit facility with union bank of california uboc  as administrative agent and issuing lender  and the other lenders party thereto 
pursuant to the agreement  uboc acts as the administrative agent for a senior  first lien secured borrowing base revolving credit facility the credit facility in favor of us and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries which subsidiaries include edge petroleum operating company  inc  edge petroleum exploration company  miller oil corporation and miller exploration company in an amount equal to million  of which only million was available under the borrowing base established at the closing 
the credit facility has a letter of credit sub limit of million 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our oil and natural gas properties 
in connection with the credit facility  we paid the lenders fees in an amount equal to of the initial borrowing base established under the credit facility  or million  on january  we paid approximately million to the lenders for certain other administrative fees  fronting fees and work fees in connection with the credit facility 
upon initiation of the credit facility  we terminated our existing third amended and restated credit agreement described above and repaid the million in borrowings under the prior credit facility with proceeds from the public offerings described below and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the credit facility matures on january  and bears interest at libor plus an applicable margin ranging from to or prime plus a margin of up to  with an unused commitment fee ranging from to 
as of december   our interest rates on our outstanding prime and libor borrowings were and  respectively 
as of december   million in borrowings were outstanding under the credit facility 
the credit facility provides for certain restrictions  including  but not limited to  limitations on additional borrowings  sales of oil and natural gas properties or other collateral  and engaging in merger or consolidation transactions 
the credit facility restricts dividends and certain distributions of cash or properties and certain liens and also contains financial covenants including  without limitation  the following an ebitdax to interest expense ratio requires that as of the last day of each fiscal quarter the ratio of a our consolidated ebitdax defined as ebitda plus similar non cash items and exploration and abandonment expenses for such period to b our consolidated interest expense  not be less than to  calculated on a cumulative quarterly basis for the first months after the closing of the credit facility and then on a rolling four quarter basis 
a current ratio requires that as of the last day of each fiscal quarter the ratio of our consolidated current assets to our consolidated current liabilities  as defined in the credit facility  be at least to a maximum leverage ratio requires that as of the last day of each fiscal quarter the ratio of a total indebtedness as defined in the credit facility to b an amount equal to consolidated ebitdax be not greater than to  calculated on a cumulative quarterly basis for the first months after the closing of the credit facility and then on a rolling four quarter basis 
the credit facility includes other covenants and events of default that we believe are customary for similar facilities 
it is an event of default under the credit facility if we undergo a change in control 
change in control  as defined in the credit facility  means any of the following events a any person or group within the meaning of section d or d of the exchange act has become  directly or indirectly  the beneficial owner as defined in rules d and d under the exchange act  except that a person shall be deemed to have beneficial ownership of all such shares that any such person has the right to acquire  whether such right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time  by way of merger  consolidation or otherwise  of a majority or more of our common stock on a fully diluted basis  after giving effect to the conversion and exercise of all of our outstanding warrants  options and other securities whether or not such securities are then currently convertible or exercisable  b during any period of two consecutive calendar quarters  individuals who at the beginning of such period were members of our board of directors cease for any reason to constitute a majority of the directors then in office unless i such new directors were elected by a majority of our directors who constituted the board of directors at the beginning of such period or by directors so elected or ii the reason for such directors failing to constitute a majority is a result of retirement by directors due to age  death or disability  or c we cease to own directly or indirectly all of the equity interests of each of our subsidiaries 
our available borrowing capacity under the credit facility was million at december  the borrowing base was reduced from million to million during the fourth quarter of we expect another reduction in the borrowing base  which will be redetermined in the second quarter of  as a result of the sale of certain non core assets during the first quarter of and the reduction of total proved reserves as reported in the year end reserve reports of our independent reserve engineers 
as of march   million in borrowings were outstanding under our credit facility 
shelf registration statement offerings during the second quarter  we filed a registration statement with the sec which  as amended in a third quarter filing  registered securities of up to million of any combination of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock  warrants for debt securities or equity securities of the company and guarantees of debt securities by our subsidiaries 
net proceeds  terms and pricing of the offering of securities issued under the shelf registration statement will be determined at the time of the offerings 
the shelf registration statement does not provide assurance that we will or could sell any such securities 
our ability to utilize our shelf registration statement for the purpose of issuing  from time to time  any combination of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock or warrants for debt securities or equity securities will depend upon  among other things  market conditions and the existence of investors who wish to purchase our securities at prices acceptable to us 
the shelf registration statement replaced a previous shelf registration statement  which registered offerings of up to million of securities 
in january  we completed concurrent offerings of million shares of our common stock and million shares of our series a cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock convertible preferred stock 
the shares were offered to the public at a price of per share of common stock and per share of convertible preferred stock 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the offerings million from the common offering and million from the preferred offering  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the expenses of the offerings 
these proceeds were used to partially finance the january acquisition and to refinance our prior credit facility 
convertible preferred stock as noted above  we completed the public offering of  shares of our convertible preferred stock in january we used the million in net proceeds from this offering  along with the proceeds from the concurrent common stock offering and borrowings under our credit facility  to finance the january acquisition and to refinance our prior credit facility 
dividends 
the convertible preferred stock accumulates dividends at a rate of for each share of convertible preferred stock per year 
dividends are cumulative from the date of first issuance and  to the extent payment of dividends is not prohibited by our debt agreements  assets are legally available to pay dividends and our board of directors or an authorized committee of our board declares a dividend payable  we will pay dividends in cash  every quarter 
the first payment was made on april  and we continued to make quarterly dividends payments throughout no dividends or other distributions other than a dividend payable solely in shares of a like or junior ranking may be paid or set apart for payment upon any shares ranking equally with the convertible preferred stock parity shares or shares ranking junior to the convertible preferred stock junior shares  nor may any parity shares or junior shares be redeemed or acquired for any consideration by us except by conversion into or exchange for shares of a like or junior ranking unless all accumulated and unpaid dividends have been paid or funds therefor have been set apart on the convertible preferred stock and any parity shares 
liquidation preference 
in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation  winding up or dissolution  each holder of convertible preferred stock will be entitled to receive and to be paid out of our assets available for distribution to our stockholders  before any payment or distribution is made to holders of junior stock including common stock  but after any distribution on any of our indebtedness or senior stock  a liquidation preference in the amount of per share of the convertible preferred stock  plus accumulated and unpaid dividends on the shares to the date fixed for liquidation  winding up or dissolution 
ranking 
our convertible preferred stock ranks senior to all of the shares of our common stock and to all of our other capital stock issued in the future unless the terms of such capital stock expressly provide that it ranks senior to  or on a parity with  shares of our convertible preferred stock  on a parity with all of our other capital stock issued in the future  the terms of which expressly provide that it will rank on a parity with the shares of our convertible preferred stock  and junior to all of our existing and future debt obligations and to all shares of our capital stock issued in the future  the terms of which expressly provide that such shares will rank senior to the shares of our convertible preferred stock 
mandatory conversion 
on or after january   we may  at our option  cause shares of our convertible preferred stock to be automatically converted at the applicable conversion rate  but only if the closing sale price of our common stock for trading days within a period of consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately preceding the date we give the conversion notice equals or exceeds of the conversion price in effect on each such trading day 
optional redemption 
if fewer than of the shares of convertible preferred stock issued in the convertible preferred stock offering including any additional shares issued pursuant to the underwriters over allotment option are outstanding  we may  at any time on or after january   at our option  redeem for cash all such convertible preferred stock at a redemption price equal to the liquidation preference of plus any accrued and unpaid dividends  if any  on a share of convertible preferred stock to  but excluding  the redemption date  for each share of convertible preferred stock 
conversion rights 
each share of convertible preferred stock may be converted at any time  at the option of the holder  into approximately shares of our common stock which is based on an initial conversion price of per share of common stock  subject to adjustment plus cash in lieu of fractional shares  subject to our right to settle all or a portion of any such conversion in cash or shares of our common stock 
if we elect to settle all or any portion of our conversion obligation in cash  the conversion value and the number of shares of our common stock we will deliver upon conversion if any will be based upon a trading day averaging period 
upon any conversion  the holder will not receive any cash payment representing accumulated and unpaid dividends on the convertible preferred stock  whether or not in arrears  except in limited circumstances 
the conversion rate is equal to divided by the conversion price at the time 
the conversion price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events 
the conversion price on the conversion date and the number of shares of our common stock  as applicable  to be delivered upon conversion may be adjusted if certain events occur 
purchase upon fundamental change 
if we become subject to a fundamental change as defined herein  each holder of shares of convertible preferred stock will have the right to require us to purchase any or all of its shares at a purchase price equal to of the liquidation preference  plus accumulated and unpaid dividends  to the date of the purchase 
we will have the option to pay the purchase price in cash  shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares 
our ability to purchase all or a portion of the convertible preferred stock for cash is subject to our obligation to repay or repurchase any outstanding debt required to be repaid or repurchased in connection with a fundamental change and to any contractual restrictions then contained in our debt 
conversion in connection with a fundamental change 
if a holder elects to convert its shares of our convertible preferred stock in connection with certain fundamental changes  we will in certain circumstances increase the conversion rate for such convertible preferred stock 
upon a conversion in connection with a fundamental change  the holder will be entitled to receive a cash payment for all accumulated and unpaid dividends 
a fundamental change will be deemed to have occurred upon the occurrence of any of the following a person or group subject to specified exceptions  discloses that the person or group has become the direct or indirect ultimate beneficial owner of our common equity representing more than of the voting power of our common equity other than a filing with a disclosure relating to a transaction which complies with the proviso in subsection below  consummation of any share exchange  consolidation or merger of us pursuant to which our common stock will be converted into cash  securities or other property or any sale  lease or other transfer in one transaction or a series of transactions of all or substantially all of the consolidated assets of us and our subsidiaries  taken as a whole  to any person other than one of our subsidiaries  provided  however  that a transaction where the holders of more than of all classes of our common equity immediately prior to the transaction own  directly or indirectly  more than of all classes of common equity of the continuing or surviving corporation or transferee immediately after the event shall not be a fundamental change  we are liquidated or dissolved or holders of our capital stock approve any plan or proposal for our liquidation or dissolution  or our common stock is neither listed on a national securities exchange nor listed nor approved for quotation on an over the counter market in the united states 
however  a fundamental change will not be deemed to have occurred in the case of a share exchange  merger or consolidation  or in an exchange offer having the result described in subsection above  if or more of the consideration in the aggregate paid for common stock and excluding cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments pursuant to dissenters appraisal rights in the share exchange  merger or consolidation or exchange offer consists of common stock of a united states company traded on a national securities exchange or which will be so traded or quoted when issued or exchanged in connection with such transaction 
voting rights 
if we fail to pay dividends for six quarterly dividend periods whether or not consecutive or if we fail to pay the purchase price on the purchase date for the convertible preferred stock following a fundamental change  holders of our convertible preferred stock will have voting rights to elect two directors to our board 
in addition  we may generally not  without the approval of the holders of at least of the shares of our convertible preferred stock then outstanding amend our restated certificate of incorporation  as amended  by merger or otherwise  if the amendment would alter or change the powers  preferences  privileges or rights of the holders of shares of our convertible preferred stock so as to adversely affect them  issue  authorize or increase the authorized amount of  or issue or authorize any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase  any senior stock  or reclassify any of our authorized stock into any senior stock of any class  or any obligation or security convertible into or evidencing a right to purchase any senior stock 
off balance sheet arrangements the company currently does not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual cash obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  by payment due date total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt   fin expected liabilities operating leases     total contractual cash obligations   excludes amounts for interest expense payable upon outstanding debt 
long term outstanding debt under our credit facility is subject to floating interest rates see note to our consolidated financial statements and payable on the last day of each calendar month while any loan amounts remain outstanding 
we do not forecast debt repayments beyond the current year 
therefore  cash payments for interest beyond one year cannot be estimated 
we expect to pay approximately to million in interest during although unrecognized tax benefits are not a contractual obligation  they are presented in this table because they represent potential demands on our liquidity 
the table excludes quarterly dividends on our convertible preferred stock 
dividends are cumulative and payable in arrears if not paid each quarter and are expected to total million for we did not have any capital leases or purchase obligations as of december  we have not included our aro liability here because historically the actual cash outlay is minimized significantly by the salvage value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we do not account for salvage value on our balance sheet 
we have not included the deficiency payment on our delivery commitment because we believe we will be able to meet this physical delivery commitment 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
risk management activities derivatives and hedging due to the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  we may enter into  from time to time  price risk management transactions eg  swaps  collars and floors related to our expected oil and natural gas production to seek to achieve a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce exposure to commodity price fluctuations 
while the use of these arrangements may limit our ability to benefit from increases in the price of oil and natural gas  it is also intended to reduce our potential exposure to adverse price movements 
see approach to the business for a discussion of our current level of derivative contracts as it relates to expected production 
our arrangements  to the extent we enter into any  are intended to apply to only a portion of our expected production  and thereby provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices while limiting our potential gains from future increases in prices 
none of these instruments are  at the time of their execution  intended to be used for trading purposes but may be deemed as such because of the expected decrease in our anticipated production 
the use of derivative instruments involves the risk that the counterparties to such instruments will be unable to meet the financial obligations of such contracts 
on a quarterly basis  our management sets all of our price risk management policies  including volumes  types of instruments and counterparties 
these policies are implemented by management through the execution of trades by the chief financial officer after consultation and concurrence by the president and chairman of the board 
our board of directors monitors the company s price risk management policies and trades on a monthly basis 
all of these price risk management transactions are considered derivative instruments and accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended 
these derivative instruments are intended to hedge our price risk and may be considered hedges for economic purposes 
there are two types of accounting treatments for derivatives  i mark to market accounting and ii cash flow hedge accounting 
for discussion of these accounting treatments  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we currently apply mark to market accounting treatment to all of our derivative contracts 
all derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and the changes in fair value are presented in total revenue on the income statement 
the following table provides additional information regarding our various derivative transactions that were recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as of december  fair value of contracts outstanding at december   contracts realized or otherwise settled during the period  fair value of new contracts when entered into during asset liability  changes in fair values attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions other changes in fair values  fair values of contracts outstanding at december   the following table details the fair value of our commodity based derivative contracts by year of maturity and valuation methodology as of december  fair value of contracts at december  source of fair value maturity less than year maturity years maturity years maturity in excess of years total fair value prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources asset liability   prices based on models and other valuation methods total   tax matters at december   we had cumulative net operating loss carryforwards nols for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that expire beginning in we also had state nol carryforwards at december  of million  which will expire in varying amounts between and these estimated nols assume that certain items  primarily intangible drilling costs  have been written off for tax purposes in the current year 
however  we have not made a final determination if an election will be made to capitalize all or part of these items for tax purposes in the future 
our ability to utilize federal nol carryforwards in cases where the nol was acquired in a reorganization may be subject to limitations under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended section if we undergo a majority ownership change as defined by section we would undergo a majority ownership change if  among other things  the stockholders who own or have owned  directly or indirectly  five percent or more of our common stock or are otherwise treated as five percent stockholders under section and the regulations promulgated thereunder  increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our stock by more than percentage points over the lowest percentage of stock owned by these stockholders at any time during the testing period  which is generally the three year period preceding the potential ownership change 
in the event of a majority ownership change  section imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with the nol carryforwards 
any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration of the respective nol carryforwards 
the amount of the limitation may  under certain circumstances  be increased by built in gains held by us at the time of the change that are recognized in the five year period after the change 
if we were to undergo a majority ownership change  we would be required to record a reserve for some or all of the asset currently recorded on our balance sheet 
as of december   we believe that there may have been an additional change of ownership pursuant to section as a result of the concurrent public offerings of our common and preferred stock that occurred in january we cannot make assurances that we will not undergo a majority ownership change in the future because an ownership change for federal tax purposes can occur based on trades among our existing stockholders 
whether we undergo a majority ownership change may be a matter beyond our control 
further  in light of the ongoing strategic assessment process  we cannot provide any assurance that a potential sale or merger will not reduce the availability of our nol carryforward and other federal income tax attributes  which may be significantly limited or possibly eliminated 
at december   under section rules  approximately million of our total federal nol carryforward of million was subject to a potential annual limitation of million 
of that million  million was subject to further annual limitations 
the million amount represents the following two separate limitations which occurred prior to million acquired in a december merger  which is subject to an annual limitation of approximately million per year and million acquired in a november acquisition  which is subject to an annual limitation of approximately million per year 
in june  the fasb issued fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as a result of the adoption of fin on january   we recognized a liability of  which reduced the january  retained earnings balance 
the amount recorded does not include interest as the anticipated adjustments more likely than not will result in no current tax due as a result of nol carryovers 
all of the amounts of unrecognized tax benefits reported affect the effective tax rate through deferred tax accounting 
fin prescribes a benefit recognition model with a two step approach  a more likely than not recognition criterion and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being ultimately realized upon ultimate settlement 
if it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits  no benefit will be recorded 
fin also requires that the amount of interest expense to be recognized related to uncertain tax positions be computed by applying the applicable statutory rate of interest to the difference between the tax position recognized in accordance with fin and the amount previously taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we also adopted fsp fin as of january   which provides that a company s tax position will be considered settled if the taxing authority has completed its examination  the company does not plan to appeal  and it is remote that the taxing authority would reexamine the tax position in the future 
we had no reserves prior to adoption at january  we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense 
however  we accrued no interest or penalties at december  recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r expands the definition of transactions and events that qualify as business combinations  requires that the acquired assets and liabilities  including contingencies  be recorded at the fair value determined on the acquisition date and changes thereafter reflected in revenue  not goodwill  changes the recognition timing for restructuring costs  and requires acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred 
adoption of sfas no 
r is required for combinations after december  early adoption and retroactive application of sfas no 
r to fiscal years preceding the effective date are not permitted 
however  accounting for changes in valuation allowances for acquired deferred tax assets and the resolution of uncertain tax positions for prior business combinations will impact tax expense instead of impacting the prior business combination accounting starting january  we are currently evaluating the changes provided in sfas no 
r and believe it could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if we undertake a significant acquisition or business combination 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements sfas no 

sfas no 
re characterizes minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries as non controlling interests and requires the classification of minority interests as a component of equity 
under sfas no 
 a change in control will be measured at fair value  with any gain or loss recognized in earnings 
the effective date for sfas no 
is for annual periods beginning on or after december  early adoption and retroactive application of sfas no 
to fiscal years preceding the effective date are not permitted 
we currently do not expect adoption of this statement to have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fas statement no 
sfas no 
gives companies the option of applying at specified election dates fair value accounting to certain financial instruments and other items that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
if a company chooses to record eligible items at fair value  the company must report unrealized gains and losses on those items in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas no 
also prescribes presentation and disclosure requirements for assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value pursuant to this standard and pursuant to the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities as amended 
sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal year as the provisions of sfas no 
are applied prospectively  the impact to the registrants will depend on the instruments selected for fair value measurement at the time of implementation 
we are currently assessing the impact that sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also gives expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas no 
does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas no 
establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop fair value assumptions 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb issued a fasb staff position fsp on sfas no 
that permits a one year delay of the effective date for all non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january   with the exceptions allowed under the fsp described above and do not expect any significant impact on our consolidated financial statements  other than expanded disclosures beginning with our quarterly report on form q for the fiscal quarter ended march  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we use a credit facility  which has a floating interest rate  to finance a portion of our operations 
we are not subject to fair value risk resulting from changes in our floating interest rates 
the use of floating rate debt instruments provides a benefit due to downward interest rate movements but does not limit us to exposure from future increases in interest rates 
based on the year end december  outstanding borrowings and interest rates of and applied to various borrowings  a change in these interest rates would result in an increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
in the normal course of business  we enter into derivative transactions  including commodity price collars  swaps and floors to mitigate our exposure to commodity price movements  but not for trading or speculative purposes 
while the use of these arrangements may limit the benefit to us of increases in the price of oil and natural gas  it also limits the downside risk of adverse price movements 
during early  we put in place several natural gas and crude oil collars to hedge our expected and production to achieve a more predictable cash flow 
as a result of recent changes to our forecasted production and the impact of certain asset divestitures  both of which have reduced expected production as compared to that expected at the time we entered into the derivative contracts  we currently have approximately and of our anticipated natural gas and crude oil production  respectively  covered by derivative contracts 
this overhedged position exposes us to greater risk of commodity price increases because we will not have the physical production cash inflows to offset any potential losses incurred on the portion of the contracts that are overhedged 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these contracts 
the following is a list of contracts outstanding at december  transaction date transaction type beginning ending price per unit volumes per day fair value outstanding as of december  in thousands natural gas collar  mmbtu collar  mmbtu collar  mmbtu collar  mmbtu collar  mmbtu crude oil swap  bbl  collar bbl our natural gas collars were entered into on a per mmbtu delivered price basis  using the nymex natural gas index 
mark to market accounting treatment is applied to these contracts and the change in fair value is reflected in total revenue 
our crude oil contracts were entered into on a per barrel delivered price basis  using the west texas intermediate light sweet crude oil index 
mark to market accounting treatment is applied to these contracts and the change in fair value is reflected in total revenue 
at december   the fair value of the outstanding contracts was a net liability of approximately million see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management activities derivatives and hedging 
a change in the commodity price per unit  as long as the price is either above the ceiling or below the floor price of each contract  would cause the fair value total of the hedge to increase or decrease by approximately million 
all of our business is conducted in the united states with transactions denominated in us dollars and  as a result  we do not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks
