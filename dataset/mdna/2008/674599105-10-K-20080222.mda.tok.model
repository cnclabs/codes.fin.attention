item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a incorporating item a strategy general in this report  occidental refers to occidental petroleum corporation  a delaware corporation opc  and or one or more entities in which it owns a majority voting interest subsidiaries 
occidental s business is divided into two segments conducted through oil and gas subsidiaries and their affiliates and chemical subsidiaries and their affiliates 
occidental aims to generate superior total returns to stockholders using the following strategy focus on large  long lived oil and gas assets with long term growth potential  maintain financial discipline and a strong balance sheet  and manage the chemical segment to provide cash in excess of normal capital expenditures 
occidental prefers to own large  long lived legacy oil and gas assets  like those in california and the permian basin  that tend to have moderate decline rates  enhanced secondary and tertiary recovery opportunities and economies of scale that lead to cost effective production 
management expects such assets to contribute substantially to earnings and cash flow after invested capital 
at occidental  maintaining financial discipline means investing capital in projects that management expects will generate above cost of capital returns throughout the business cycle 
during periods of high commodity prices  occidental expects to use most of its cash flow after capital expenditures to enhance stockholders returns by continuing its program for evaluating dividend increases and potential stock repurchases 
the chemical business is not managed with a growth strategy 
capital is expended to operate the chemical business in a safe and environmentally sound way  to sustain production capacity and to focus on projects designed to improve the competitiveness of these assets 
asset acquisitions may be pursued when they are expected to enhance the existing core chlor alkali and polyvinyl chloride pvc businesses 
historically  the chemical segment has generated cash flow exceeding its normal capital expenditure requirements

the oil and gas business seeks to add new oil and natural gas reserves at a pace ahead of production while keeping costs incurred for finding and development among the lowest in the industry 
the oil and gas business implements this strategy within the limits of the overall corporate strategy primarily by continuing to add commercial reserves through a combination of focused exploration and development programs conducted in and around occidental s core areas  which are the united states  the middle east north africa and latin america  pursuing commercial opportunities in core areas to enhance the development of mature fields with large volumes of remaining oil by applying appropriate technology and advanced reservoir management practices  and maintaining a disciplined approach in buying and selling assets at attractive prices 
over the past several years  occidental has strengthened its asset base within each of the core areas 
occidental has invested in  and disposed of  assets with the goal of raising the average performance and potential of its assets 
see oil and gas segment business review for a discussion of these changes 
in addition  occidental has continued to make capital contributions and investments in the dolphin project in qatar and the united arab emirates uae  the mukhaizna project in oman  and libya for continued growth opportunities 
occidental s overall performance during the past several years reflects the successful implementation of its strategy to enhance the development of mature fields  beginning with the acquisition of the elk hills oil and gas field in california in  followed by a series of purchases in the permian basin in west texas and new mexico and the integration of vintage petroleum  inc vintage and plains exploration and production company plains operations acquired in at the end of  the elk hills and permian assets made up percent of occidental s consolidated proven oil reserves and percent of its consolidated proven gas reserves 
on a barrels of oil equivalent boe basis  these assets accounted for percent of occidental s consolidated reserves 
in  the combined production from these assets averaged approximately  barrels of oil equivalent boe per day

oxychem s strategy is to be a low cost producer in order to maximize its cash flow generation 
oxychem concentrates on the chlorovinyls chain beginning with chlorine  which is coproduced with caustic soda  after which chlorine and ethylene are converted through a series of intermediate products into pvc 
oxychem s focus on chlorovinyls permits it to take advantage of economies of scale 
key performance indicators general occidental seeks to ensure that it meets its strategic goals by continuously measuring its success in maintaining below average debt levels and top quartile performance compared to its peers in total return to stockholders  return on equity  return on capital employed  and other segment specific measurements such as profit per unit produced  cost to produce each unit  cash flow per unit  cost to find and develop new reserves  reserves replacement percentage and other similar measures 
debt structure occidental s year end total debt to capitalization ratio declined to percent from percent at the end of during that time  occidental has reduced its debt over percent while increasing its stockholders equity by percent 
since the second quarter of  occidental s long term senior unsecured debt has been rated a by standard and poor s corporation  a by moody s investors service moody s  and a low by dominion bond rating service 
in july  fitch ratings upgraded occidental s long term senior unsecured debt rating from a to a 
in december  moody s and standard and poor s raised their outlook on occidental s credit ratings from stable to positive 
a security rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities  may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization and should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
return on equity annual a three year average b a the return on equity for was calculated by dividing occidental s net income by the average equity balance in b the three year average return on equity was calculated by dividing the average net income over the three year period by the average equity balance over the same period 
occidental has focused on achieving top quartile return on equity 
in  occidental s return on equity was percent and the three year average return on equity was percent 
during the same three year period  occidental increased its stockholders equity by percent and its annual dividend by percent while its stock price increased by percent 
oil and gas segment business environment oil and gas prices are the major variables that drive the industry s short and intermediate term financial performance 
average yearly oil prices strengthened in over levels and ended the year higher than year end levels 
during  occidental experienced an improvement in its price differential between the average west texas intermediate wti price and occidental s realized prices 
occidental s realized price as a percentage of wti was approximately percent and percent for and  respectively 
prices and differentials can vary significantly  even on a short term basis  making it difficult to forecast realized prices 
the average wti market price for was per barrel compared with per barrel in occidental s average realized price for oil in was per barrel  compared with per barrel in the average new york mercantile exchange nymex domestic natural gas prices decreased approximately percent from for  nymex gas prices averaged mcf compared with mcf for business review all production and reserves figures are net to occidental unless otherwise specified

occidental acquired oil and gas interests in the permian basin and a gas processing plant in texas from bp 
occidental also sold its oil and gas interests in pakistan to bp 
as a result of these transactions  both the horn mountain and pakistan operations were classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the twelve months of include after tax gains of million related to these transactions 
in january  occidental sold its percent joint venture interest in russia for an after tax gain of approximately million 
permian basin the permian basin extends throughout southwest texas and southeast new mexico and is one of the largest and most active oil basins in the united states  with the entire basin accounting for approximately percent of the total united states oil production 
occidental is the largest producer in the permian basin with an approximate percent net share of the total permian basin oil production 
occidental also produces and processes natural gas and natural gas liquids ngl in the permian basin 
a significant portion of occidental s permian basin interests were obtained through the acquisition of altura energy ltd 
in additional acquisitions of oil and gas producing property interests were subsequently made 
occidental s total share of permian basin oil  gas and ngl production averaged approximately  boe per day in at the end of  occidental s permian basin properties had billion boe in proved reserves 
occidental s permian basin production is diversified across a large number of producing areas 
in  wasson san andres was occidental s largest permian producing field with an average of approximately  boe per day of production and with million boe of proved reserves at year end 
this field represents percent of occidental s daily permian basin production and percent of its year end permian basin proved reserves 
occidental s interests in the permian basin offer additional development and exploitation potential 
during  occidental drilled approximately wells on its operated properties and participated in additional wells drilled on outside operated interests 
occidental conducted significant development activity on nine carbon dioxide co projects during  including implementation of new floods and expansion of existing co floods 
occidental also focused on improving the performance of existing wells 
occidental had an average of well service units working in the permian area during performing well maintenance and workovers 
approximately percent of occidental s permian basin oil production is from fields that actively employ the application of co flood technology  an enhanced oil recovery eor technique 
this involves injecting co into oil reservoirs where it acts as a solvent  causing the oil to flow more freely into producing wells 
these co flood operations make occidental a world leader in the application of this technology 
california elk hills occidental s interest at elk hills includes the elk hills oil and gas field in the southern portion of california s san joaquin valley  which it operates with an approximately percent interest  and other non unit properties 
the elk hills field is the largest producer of gas in california 
oil and gas production in from the elk hills properties was approximately  boe per day 
during  occidental continued to perform infill drilling  field extensions and recompletions identified by advanced reservoir characterization techniques  resulting in new wells being drilled and wells being worked over 
at the end of  the elk hills properties had an estimated million boe of proved reserves 
vintage production california in  occidental combined its california properties acquired from vintage and plains with existing california properties excluding the elk hills  thums and tidelands oil production company tidelands properties

dolphin energy owns and operates a mile long  inch natural gas pipeline  which transports dry natural gas from qatar to the uae 
the transportation of gas through the pipeline started in the first quarter of using third party natural gas and production under the dpsa began in july from qatar s north field replacing the third party natural gas 
these contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on occidental s economic interest as defined in the contracts 
occidental s share of production was approximately  boe per day in the fourth quarter of with production expected to increase to approximately  boe per day in at december   occidental s share of proved oil and gas reserves from the dolphin project was million boe 
the dolphin project is expected to cost approximately billion in total  including investments in the local uae eastern gas distribution system  the al ain fujairah and taweelah fujairah pipelines  which were added to improve the natural gas distribution system but were not contained in the original scope of the dolphin project 
occidental expects to invest approximately billion of this total  with billion invested as of december  at the end of  all offshore facilities within the original scope of the project have been completed along with construction of three of the four trains in the onshore gas processing and compression plant at ras laffan 
the fourth train is expected to be completed in the first quarter of the pipeline has a capacity to transport up to billion cubic feet bcf of natural gas per day 
demand for natural gas in the uae and oman continues to grow and dolphin energy s customers have requested additional gas supplies 
to help fulfill this growing demand  dolphin energy will continue to pursue an agreement to secure an additional supply of gas from qatar 
qatar in addition to the dolphin project  occidental participates in two production projects in qatar idd el shargi north dome isnd and idd el shargi south dome issd 
in  occidental continued development of the isnd and issd fields to recover additional reserves through advanced drilling techniques and waterflood expansion 
capital expenditures in qatar for the isnd and issd projects were million in in october  occidental acquired anadarko petroleum corporation s percent interest in an exploration and production sharing agreement covering blocks and located offshore qatar 
block is an exploration block

under the new contracts  occidental which has a percent working interest and its partner would pay a signature bonus of billion  of which occidental s share is million and which is payable over a three year period 
occidental and its partner would also contribute percent of the development capital to the project and receive approximately to percent of the gross production  depending on the specific field 
latin america argentina substantially all of occidental s argentina assets were obtained as part of the acquisition of vintage in the assets consist of concessions located in the san jorge basin in southern argentina and the cuyo basin and neuqu n basin in western argentina 
occidental operates of the concessions with a percent working interest 
during  occidental drilled new wells and performed a number of recompletions and well repairs 
occidental expects to increase production significantly over the next four years through aggressive drilling  waterflooding and eor projects 
in  occidental plans to drill wells  complete the eight waterflood projects initiated in and implement a number of new waterflood projects 
occidental s share of production from argentina averaged  boe per day in proved reserves from these assets totaled million boe at december  bolivia in  occidental s operating subsidiary acquired working interests in four blocks located in the tarija  chuquisaca and santa cruz regions of bolivia as part of the vintage acquisition

these contracts went into effect in may colombia occidental is the operator under four contracts within the llanos norte basin the cravo norte  rond n  cosecha  and chipir n association contracts 
occidental s working interests under the four contracts are percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively 
colombia s national oil company  ecopetrol  operates the ca o lim n cove as oil pipeline and marine export terminal 
the pipeline transports oil produced from the llanos norte basin for export to international markets 
in the middle magdalena basin  occidental signed an agreement with ecopetrol in for an eor project in the la cira infantas lci field  in which occidental holds a percent working interest 
in december  occidental entered into the commercial phase of the project 
production from the field is transported by ecopetrol through its pipeline and sold to ecopetrol refineries 
additionally  occidental holds various working interests in five exploration blocks 
occidental s share of production from its colombia operations was  boe per day and proved reserves reported for these interests totaled million boe at the end of production sharing contracts occidental conducts its operations in qatar  oman and yemen under pscs and  under such contracts  receives a share of production and reserves to recover its costs and an additional share for profit 
in addition  occidental s share of production and reserves from thums and tidelands are subject to contractual arrangements similar to a psc 
these contracts do not transfer any right of ownership to occidental and reserves reported from these arrangements are based on occidental s economic interest as defined in the contracts 
occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline 
overall  occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices 
proved reserves proved reserves evaluation and review process a senior corporate officer of occidental is responsible for the internal audit and review of its oil and gas reserves data 
in addition  a corporate reserves review committee reserves committee has been established  consisting of senior corporate officers  to monitor and review occidental s oil and gas reserves 
the reserves committee reports to the audit committee of occidental s board of directors periodically throughout the year 
occidental has retained ryder scott company  lp ryder scott  independent petroleum engineering consultants  to review its annual oil and gas reserve estimation processes since again in  ryder scott has compared occidental s methods and procedures for estimating oil and gas reserves to generally accepted industry standards and has reviewed certain data  methods and procedures used in estimating reserves volumes  the economic evaluations and reserves classifications 
ryder scott reviewed the specific application of such methods and procedures for a selection of oil and gas fields considered to be a valid representation of occidental s total reserves portfolio 
in  ryder scott reviewed approximately percent of occidental s oil and gas reserves 
since being engaged in  ryder scott has reviewed occidental s reserve estimation methods and procedures for approximately percent of occidental s reported oil and gas reserves 
based on this review  including the data  technical processes and interpretations presented by occidental  ryder scott has concluded that the methodologies used by occidental in preparing the relevant estimates generally comply with current securities and exchange commission sec standards 
ryder scott has not been engaged to render an opinion as to the reserves volumes reported by occidental 
proved reserve additions occidental s consolidated subsidiaries had proved reserves at year end of  million boe  as compared with the year end amount of  million boe 
the increase in the consolidated subsidiaries reserves from all sources was million boe  which was comprised of an increase of million boe from proved developed reserves  partially offset by a decrease of million boe from proved undeveloped reserves 
proved developed reserves represented approximately percent of occidental s total proved reserves at year end compared to percent at year end proved reserve additions consolidated subsidiaries in millions of boe revisions of previous estimates improved recovery extensions and discoveries purchases total additions proved reserves consisted of percent crude oil and condensate and percent natural gas 
revisions of previous estimates in  occidental experienced a reduction of million boe of proved reserves through negative revisions of previous estimates  primarily in the dolphin project  qatar  elk hills  thums and argentina  partially offset by positive revisions in permian and hugoton 
oil price changes affect proved reserves recorded by occidental 
for example  if oil prices increased by per barrel  less oil volume is required to recover costs  and pscs would reduce occidental s share of proved reserves by approximately million boe 
conversely  if oil prices dropped by per barrel  occidental s share of proved reserves would increase by a similar amount 
oil price changes also tend to affect the economic lives of proved reserves from other contracts  in a manner partially offsetting the psc reserve volume changes 
apart from the effects of product prices  occidental believes its approach to interpreting technical data regarding oil and gas reserves makes it more likely future reserve revisions will be positive rather than negative 
improved recovery in  occidental added reserves of million boe through improved recovery 
in the united states  improved recovery additions were million boe in the elk hills field  million boe in the permian basin and million boe in western colorado 
foreign additions included million boe in oman  million boe in colombia and million boe in qatar 
the elk hills operations employ infill drilling and both gas flood and water flood techniques 
in the permian basin  the increased reserves were primarily attributable to enhanced recovery techniques  such as drilling additional co flood and water flood wells 
extensions and discoveries occidental obtains reserve additions from extensions and discoveries  which are dependent on successful exploitation programs 
in  as a result of such programs  occidental added reserves of million boe  including million boe in argentina  million boe in oman and million boe in the permian basin 
the success of improved recovery  extension and discovery projects depends on reservoir characteristics and technology improvements  as well as oil and gas prices  capital costs and operating costs 
many of these factors are outside of management s control  and will affect whether or not these historical sources of reserve additions continue at similar levels 
purchases of proved reserves in  occidental purchased reserves of million boe  of which million boe were in the united states and million boe were in the middle east north africa 
occidental continues to add reserves through acquisitions when properties are available at prices it deems reasonable 
acquisitions are dependent on successful bidding and negotiating of oil and gas contracts at attractive terms 
as market conditions change  the available supply of properties may increase or decrease accordingly 
proved undeveloped reserves occidental had proved undeveloped reserve additions of million boe resulting from improved recovery  extensions and discoveries and purchases  primarily in the elk hills field  the permian basin  oman and argentina 
elk hills provided percent of this increase 
these proved undeveloped reserve additions were offset by reserve transfers to the proved developed category as a result of development programs 
the dolphin project transferred million boe to the proved developed category during  with no remaining undeveloped reserves at year end 
in the united states  the elk hills field and the permian basin each transferred million boe into proved developed reserves from proved undeveloped reserves 
industry outlook the petroleum industry is highly competitive and subject to significant volatility due to numerous market forces 
crude oil and natural gas prices are affected by market fundamentals such as weather  inventory levels  competing fuel prices  overall demand and the availability of supply 
worldwide oil prices rose throughout and reached historical highs during the last half of the year 
continued economic growth  resulting in increased demand  and concerns about supply availability  could result in continued high prices 
a lower demand growth rate could result in lower crude oil prices 
oil prices have significantly affected profitability and returns for occidental and other upstream producers 
oil prices cannot be predicted with any certainty 
the wti price has averaged approximately per barrel over the past ten years 
however  the industry has historically experienced wide fluctuations in prices 
see the oil and gas segment business environment section above for further information 
while local supply demand fundamentals are a decisive factor affecting domestic natural gas prices over the long term  day to day prices may be more volatile in the futures markets  such as on the nymex and other exchanges  making it difficult to forecast prices with any degree of confidence 
over the last ten years  the nymex gas price has averaged approximately per mcf 
chemical segment business environment the chemical segment results decreased in due to the softening united states housing market and continued high feedstock costs  which led to lower margins in the pvc business 
this was partially offset by an increase in demand for united states products in export markets in aided by expanding international economies along with favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
business review basic chemicals during  demand and pricing for basic chemical products generally remained strong  although demand for domestic chlorine slightly weakened compared to due to a slowdown in the united states housing sector 
domestic industry demand for liquid caustic soda in was virtually flat compared to the prior year  however  industry export demand increased over export demand was supported by increasing alumina capacity in south america as well as favorable currency exchange rates 
margins in continued at levels as pricing and feedstock costs remained relatively unchanged 
pricing for liquid caustic soda started the year strong and increased every quarter of aided by unplanned global supply disruptions and a strong export market 
oxychem s chlor alkali operating rate for was percent  which was the same as the industry average operating rate for vinyls domestic demand for pvc in was percent below as a result of the significant slump in housing 
this was partially offset by exports from the united states  which were up percent in over  resulting in overall demand for pvc being down percent in compared to  margins in decreased as price increases were not able to compensate for raw material cost increases 
from early to the end of the year  industry pvc prices increased by percent while the cost of ethylene increased by percent 
oxychem operated its pvc facilities at an average operating rate of percent for  compared to the north american industry average of percent 
industry outlook in  occidental s chemical business earnings were lower than  primarily due to the weakening of the united states housing market 
future performance will depend on the recovery of united states construction activity  global economic activity  the competitiveness of the united states in the world economy  feedstock and energy pricing  and the impact of additional production capacity entering the market place 
basic chemicals forecasts of a slowing united states economy offset by a continued strong export market in are expected to result in demand levels similar to levels 
despite continued pressure on the vinyls market  margins in are expected to remain similar to  but could weaken in the second half due to the anticipated impact of capacity additions in mid vinyls industry wide pvc operating rates are expected to be lower in as a result of weak demand  especially in housing  coupled with the start up of new capacity in the first half of the year 
exports of united states produced products are expected to maintain their competitive advantage due to the weak united states dollar 
cost pressures are also expected to continue due to high feedstock costs 
corporate and other corporate and other includes investments in two cogeneration facilities in taft  louisiana and ingleside  texas and two common carrier pipelines in the permian basin  one of which was purchased in  which are used in corporate directed activities

consolidated analysis of financial position the changes in the following components of occidental s balance sheet are discussed below selected balance sheet components in millions current assets cash and cash equivalents short term investments trade receivables  net receivables from joint ventures  partnerships and other inventories prepaid expenses and other assets of discontinued operations total current assets investments in unconsolidated entities property  plant and equipment  net current liabilities current maturities of long term debt and notes payable accounts payable accrued liabilities dividends payable domestic and foreign income taxes liabilities of discontinued operations total current liabilities long term debt  net deferred credits and other liabilities income taxes deferred credits and other liabilities other long term liabilities of discontinued operations minority interest stockholders equity assets see cash flow analysis for discussion about the change in cash and cash equivalents 
the decrease in short term investments was due to the sale of occidental s investments in auction rate securities 
the increase in trade receivables  net was due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices and volumes during the fourth quarter of compared to the decrease in receivables from joint ventures  partnerships and other was due to mark to market adjustments on derivative instruments 
the increase in inventories was due to an increase in materials and supplies  mainly in colombia and libya  and higher purchases from third parties in the marketing and trading operations 
the increase in prepaid expense and other was due to increases in current deferred tax assets and higher prepaid insurance premiums 
the decrease in assets of discontinued operations was due to the sale of pakistan operations and an exchange involving the horn mountain operations with bp during the decrease in investments in unconsolidated entities was due to the sale of million shares of lyondell and the sale of occidental s interest in a russian joint venture 
the increase in property  plant and equipment pp e  net was due to capital expenditures in and various oil and gas acquisitions  offset by dd a and sales of various oil and gas assets 
liabilities and stockholders equity the increase in accounts payable was due to higher prices and volumes for purchased crude oil and natural gas in the marketing and trading operations 
in  the decrease in accrued liabilities was due to contract bonus payments in oman  contingent payments related to acquisitions and accruals for interest that were paid for in the debt tender offers 
the decrease in domestic and foreign income taxes was due to the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin the decrease in long term debt  net was due to the january debt repurchases under cash tender offers  the may redemption of the vintage senior notes due and required debt payments 
the increase in deferred credits and other liabilities other was due to an increase in asset retirement obligations and higher mark to market adjustments on derivative instruments 
the decrease in minority interest was due to occidental s purchase of the minority interest in a chemical operation from a third party 
the increase in stockholders equity reflects net income for partially offset by treasury stock repurchases of approximately million shares in and dividend payments 
liquidity and capital resources at december   occidental had approximately billion in cash on hand 
although income and cash flows are largely dependent on oil and gas prices and production  occidental believes that cash on hand and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund its operating needs  capital expenditure requirements  dividend payments  anticipated acquisitions  debt payments and purchases under its announced common stock repurchase program 
if needed  occidental could access its existing credit facilities 
in september  occidental amended and restated its billion bank credit credit facility to  among other things  lower the interest rate and extend the term to september in september  participating lenders extended the maturity date on billion of aggregate loan commitments under the credit facility to september the credit facility provides for the termination of the loan commitments and requires immediate repayment of any outstanding amounts if certain events of default occur or if occidental files for bankruptcy 
occidental did not draw down any amounts under the credit facility during available but unused lines of committed bank credit totaled approximately billion at december  none of occidental s committed bank credits contain material adverse change mac clauses or debt rating triggers that could restrict occidental s ability to borrow under these lines 
occidental s credit facilities and debt agreements do not contain rating triggers that could terminate bank commitments or accelerate debt in the event of a ratings downgrade 
at december   under the most restrictive covenants of certain financing agreements  occidental s capacity for additional unsecured borrowing was approximately billion  and the capacity for the payment of cash dividends and other distributions on  and for acquisitions of  occidental s capital stock was approximately billion  assuming that such dividends  distributions and acquisitions were made without incurring additional borrowing 
in may  occidental redeemed all million of the outstanding principal amount of its percent vintage petroleum  llc vintage senior notes due in january  occidental completed cash tender offers for its percent senior debentures due  percent senior debentures due  percent medium term notes due  percent senior debentures due and percent senior notes due  resulting in the repurchase of a portion of these debt instruments totaling million in principal amount 
the redemption and repurchases resulted in a pre tax interest expense of million 
in the first quarter of  occidental filed a shelf registration statement for up to billion of various securities 
as of december   no securities had been issued under this shelf 
cash flow analysis in millions net cash provided by operating activities the increase in operating cash flow in  compared to  resulted from higher crude oil prices and higher oil and gas production partially offset by the effects of lower chemical margins  particularly pvc  and reduced cash flow from discontinued operations 
in  occidental s realized crude oil prices increased percent and its oil and gas production increased by over percent compared to the increase in production was mainly due to the start up of the dolphin project production in the third quarter of increases in the costs of producing oil and gas  such as purchased goods and services  and higher utility  maintenance and gas plant costs  partially offset the effect of increases in realized crude oil prices 
other cost elements  such as labor costs and overhead  are not significant drivers of cash flow because they are mainly fixed within a narrow range over the short to intermediate term 
these cost increases had a much smaller effect on cash flow than the higher crude oil prices and higher crude oil and natural gas production 
most major chemical prices  especially pvc  decreased in  compared to  which reduced chemical margins 
the overall impact of the chemical price decreases on cash flow was much less significant than the increase in crude oil prices because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller that those for the oil and gas segment 
the significant increase in operating cash flow in  compared to  resulted from several factors 
the most important drivers were higher crude oil prices  higher oil and gas production and  to a much lesser extent  higher chemical margins  partially offset by the effects of lower gas prices and reduced cash flow from discontinued operations 
in  occidental s realized crude oil prices increased by percent and its oil and gas production increased by over percent compared to the increase in production was mainly due to the months of production from the vintage acquisition 
increases in the costs of producing oil and gas  such as purchased goods and services  and higher utility costs  gas plant costs and ad valorem and export taxes  partially offset the effect of oil price increases 
the cost increases had a smaller effect on cash flow than the higher crude oil prices and the higher crude oil and natural gas production 
most major chemical prices increased in  compared to  at a higher rate than ethylene costs  thereby improving chemical margins 
the overall impact of the chemical price changes on cash flow was much less than for oil and gas price changes because the chemical segment earnings and cash flow are significantly smaller than those for the oil and gas segment 
other non cash charges to income in included deferred compensation  stock incentive plan amortization and environmental remediation accruals 
other non cash charges to income in included stock incentive plan amortization  deferred compensation and environmental remediation accruals

in millions net cash used by investing activities the amount includes cash proceeds of million from the sale of million shares of lyondell  million received from the sale of occidental s interest in a russian joint venture  million from the sale of other businesses and properties  and million from the sale of auction rate securities 
the amount also includes the cash paid for the acquisitions of various oil and gas and chemical interests  a permian basin common carrier pipeline system and a gas processing plant in texas totaling billion 
the amount includes the cash payments associated with the acquisition of vintage and the property acquisition from plains  partially offset by cash proceeds from the vintage assets subsequently sold and from the sale of lyondell shares 
the amount includes the cash payments for several permian basin acquisitions  the acquisition of the vulcan chlor alkali manufacturing facilities and the payments to re enter libya and to assume operations of the mukhaizna field in oman 
these were partially offset by the cash proceeds from the sale of the premcor valero shares and the lyondell shares

in millions net cash used by financing activities the amount includes net debt payments of billion  including the repurchase of various debt issues under cash tender offers and the redemption of the vintage senior notes due the amount also included billion of cash paid for repurchases of million shares of occidental s common stock at an average price of per share 
the amount consists of billion of cash paid for occidental s stock repurchase plan and net debt payments of approximately million 
the amount includes net debt payments of approximately million 
occidental paid common stock dividends of million in  million in and million in capital expenditures in millions oil and gas chemical corporate and other total a a excludes acquisitions 
amounts are included in net cash used by investing activities discussed above 
occidental s capital spending estimate for is approximately to billion 
most of the capital spending increase will be allocated to oil and gas exploration  production and development activities for the colombia lci project and the vintage properties in argentina and california 
commitments at december   for major capital expenditures during and thereafter were approximately million 
occidental will fund these commitments and capital expenditures with cash from operations 
off balance sheet arrangements in the course of its business activities  occidental pursues a number of projects and transactions to meet its core business objectives 
the accounting and financial statement treatment of these transactions is a result of the varying methods of funding employed 
occidental also makes commitments on behalf of unconsolidated entities 
these transactions  or groups of transactions  are recorded in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and  unless otherwise noted  are not reflected on occidental s balance sheets 
the following is a description of the business purpose and nature of these transactions 
dolphin project see oil and gas segment business review middle east north africa dolphin project for further information about the structure of the dolphin project 
in july  dolphin energy entered into a bridge loan in an amount of billion 
the proceeds of the new bridge loan were used to pay off amounts outstanding on a previous bridge loan and are being used to fund the construction of the dolphin project 
the new bridge loan has a term of four years  is a revolving credit facility through april and may be converted to a term loan thereafter 
in september  dolphin energy entered into an agreement with banks to provide a billion facility to fund the construction of a certain portion of the dolphin project 
occidental guarantees percent of both of these obligations of dolphin energy 
at december   occidental s portion of the bridge loan and financing facility was million 
occidental had recorded million on the balance sheet at december   for the combined bridge loan and financing facility 
the remaining amounts of the bridge loan and financing facility drawdowns are discussed in the guarantees section below 
ecuador in ecuador  occidental has a percent interest in the oleoducto de crudos pesados ltd 
ocp oil export pipeline 
as of december   occidental s net investment in and advances to the project totaled million 
occidental reports this investment in its consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting 
the project was funded in part by senior project debt  which is to be repaid with the proceeds of ship or pay tariffs of certain upstream producers in ecuador 
in may  ecuador terminated occidental s contract for the operation of block  which comprised all of its oil producing operations in the country  and seized occidental s block assets 
occidental s guarantee of its share of the ship or pay obligations provides the lenders the right to require occidental to make an advance tariff payment as a result of the expropriation  which has not been exercised to date 
at december   the total pre tax advance tariff of approximately million was accrued in occidental s consolidated financial statements 
this advance tariff would be used by the pipeline company to service or prepay project debt 
at december   occidental also had obligations relating to performance bonds totaling million 
leases occidental has entered into various operating lease agreements  mainly for railcars  power plants  manufacturing facilities and office space 
occidental leases assets when it offers greater operating flexibility 
lease payments are expensed mainly as cost of sales 
for more information  see the contractual obligations table below 
guarantees occidental has entered into various guarantees including performance bonds  letters of credit  indemnities  commitments and other forms of guarantees provided by occidental to third parties  mainly to provide assurance that opc or its subsidiaries and affiliates will meet their various obligations guarantees 
at december   the notional amount of the guarantees that are subject to the reporting requirements of fin was approximately million  which consists of occidental s guarantee of equity investees debt  primarily from the dolphin project equity investment  and other commitments 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes and cross references certain contractual obligations that are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and or disclosed in the accompanying notes 
payments due by year contractual obligations in millions total to to and thereafter consolidated balance sheet long term debt note a capital leases note other liabilities b other obligations operating leases note c purchase obligations d  e total a excludes unamortized debt discount and interest expense on the debt 
as of december   interest on long term debt totaling million is payable in the following years in millions  to  to and and thereafter b includes accounts payable  certain accrued liabilities and obligations under postretirement benefit and deferred compensation plans 
c amounts have not been reduced for sublease rental income 
d includes long term purchase contracts and purchase orders and contracts for goods and services used in manufacturing and producing operations in the normal course of business 
some of these arrangements involve take or pay commitments but they do not represent debt obligations 
long term material purchase contracts are discounted using a percent discount rate 
e amounts exclude purchase obligations related to oil and gas marketing and trading activities where an offsetting sales position exists 
lawsuits  claims  commitments  contingencies and related matters opc or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in many lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings 
these actions seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  breach of contract  property damage  punitive damages  civil penalties or other losses  or injunctive or declaratory relief 
opc or certain of its subsidiaries also have been named in proceedings under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla and similar federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws 
these environmental proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and  in some cases  compensation for alleged property damage  punitive damages and civil penalties  however  occidental is usually one of many companies in these proceedings and has to date been successful in sharing response costs with other financially sound companies 
with respect to all such lawsuits  claims and proceedings  including environmental proceedings  occidental accrues reserves when it is probable a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
since  occidental chemical corporation occ has been served with ten lawsuits filed in nicaragua by approximately  individual plaintiffs 
these individuals allege that they have sustained several billion dollars of personal injury damages as a result of their alleged exposure to a pesticide 
occ is aware of  but has not been served in  additional cases in nicaragua  which occidental understands make similar allegations 
in the opinion of management  the claims against occ are without merit because  among other things  occ believes that none of the pesticide it manufactured was ever sold or used in nicaragua 
under the applicable nicaraguan statute  defendants are required to pay pre trial deposits so large as to effectively prohibit defendants from participating fully in their defense 
occ filed a response to the complaints contesting jurisdiction without posting such pre trial deposit 
in  the judge in one of the cases osorio case ruled the court had jurisdiction over the defendants  including occ  and that the plaintiffs had waived the requirement of the pre trial deposit 
in order to preserve its jurisdictional defense  occ elected not to make a substantive appearance in the osorio case 
in  the judge in the osorio case entered judgment against several defendants  including occ  for damages totaling approximately million 
in december  the court in a second case in nicaragua rios case entered a judgment against several defendants  including occ  for damages totaling approximately million 
while preserving its jurisdictional defenses  occ has appealed the judgments in the osorio and rios cases 
in september  the plaintiffs in the osorio case filed an action in state court in florida seeking to enforce the nicaraguan judgment 
that action was removed to and is presently pending in federal court 
occ has no assets in nicaragua and  in the opinion of management  any judgment rendered under the statute  including in the osorio and rios cases  would be unenforceable in the united states 
during the course of its operations  occidental is subject to audit by tax authorities for varying periods in various federal  state  local and foreign tax jurisdictions 
taxable years prior to are generally closed for us federal and state corporate income tax purposes 
corporate tax returns for taxable years through the current year are in various stages of audit by the us internal revenue service 
disputes may arise during the course of such audits as to facts and matters of law 
occidental has entered into agreements providing for future payments to secure terminal and pipeline capacity  drilling services  electrical power  steam and certain chemical raw materials 
at december   the net present value of the fixed and determinable portion of the obligations under these agreements  which were used to collateralize financings of the respective suppliers  aggregated million  which was payable as follows in millions     and thereafter fixed payments under these agreements were million in  million in and million in see off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations for further information 
occidental has certain other commitments under contracts  guarantees and joint ventures  including purchase commitments for goods and services at market related prices and certain other contingent liabilities 
see off balance sheet arrangements for further information 
some of these commitments  although not fixed or determinable  involve capital expenditures and are part of the to billion in capital expenditures estimated for occidental has indemnified various parties against specified liabilities that those parties might incur in the future in connection with purchases and other transactions that they have entered into with occidental 
these indemnities usually are contingent upon the other party incurring liabilities that reach specified thresholds 
as of december   occidental is not aware of circumstances that it believes would reasonably be expected to lead to future indemnity claims against it in connection with these transactions that would result in payments materially in excess of reserves 
it is impossible at this time to determine the ultimate liabilities that opc and its subsidiaries may incur resulting from any lawsuits  claims and proceedings  audits  commitments  contingencies and related matters or the timing of these liabilities 
if these matters were to be ultimately resolved unfavorably at amounts substantially exceeding occidental s reserves  an outcome not currently anticipated  it is possible that such outcome could have a material adverse effect upon occidental s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
however  after taking into account reserves  management does not expect the ultimate resolution of any of these matters to have a material adverse effect upon occidental s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
environmental liabilities and expenditures occidental s operations are subject to stringent federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to improving or maintaining environmental quality 
costs associated with environmental compliance have increased over time and are expected to rise in the future 
environmental expenditures related to current operations are factored into the overall business planning process and are considered an integral part of production in manufacturing quality products responsive to market demand 
environmental remediation the laws that require or address environmental remediation may apply retroactively to past waste disposal practices and releases of substances to the environment 
in many cases  the laws apply regardless of fault  legality of the original activities or current ownership or control of sites 
opc or certain of its subsidiaries participate in environmental assessments and cleanups under these laws at currently owned facilities  previously owned sites and third party sites 
also  opc or certain of its subsidiaries have been involved in a substantial number of governmental and private proceedings involving historical practices at various sites including  in some instances  having been named in proceedings under cercla and similar federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws 
these proceedings seek funding or performance of remediation and  in some cases  compensation for alleged property damage  punitive damages and civil penalties 
as of december   occidental  through a wholly owed subsidiary  participated in or monitored ongoing or recent assessments  remediation  proceedings or information requests at sites 
thirty nine of those sites are currently listed or proposed for listing by the us environmental protection agency on the national priorities list 
the following table presents occidental s environmental remediation reserves at december   and  grouped by three categories of environmental remediation sites amounts in millions of sites reserve balance of sites reserve balance of sites reserve balance cercla equivalent sites active facilities closed or sold facilities total the following table shows environmental reserve activity for the past three years in millions balance beginning of year remediation expenses and interest accretion changes from acquisitions payments other balance end of year occidental expects to expend funds equivalent to about half of the current environmental reserve over the next four years and the balance over the next ten or more years 
occidental believes it is reasonably possible that it will continue to incur additional liabilities beyond those recorded for environmental remediation at these sites 
the range of reasonably possible loss for existing environmental remediation matters could be up to million beyond the amount accrued 
for management s opinion with respect to environmental matters  refer to the lawsuits  claims  commitments  contingencies and related matters section above 
cercla and equivalent sites as of december   opc or certain of its subsidiaries have been named in cercla or equivalent proceedings  as shown below 
description amounts in millions of sites reserve balance minimal no exposure a reserves between mm reserves over mm total a includes sites for which maxus energy corporation has retained the liability and indemnified occidental  sites where occidental has denied liability without challenge  sites where occidental s reserves are less than  each  and sites where reserves are between  and million each 
the six sites with individual reserves over million in include a former copper mining and smelting operation in tennessee  two closed landfills in western new york and groundwater treatment facilities at three closed chemical plants montague  michigan  western new york and tacoma  washington 
active facilities certain subsidiaries of opc are currently addressing releases of substances from past operations at active facilities 
four assets a chemical plant in louisiana  a chemical plant in kansas and certain oil and gas properties and pipeline systems in the southwestern united states account for percent of the reserves associated with these facilities 
closed or sold facilities there are other sites formerly owned or operated by certain subsidiaries of opc that have ongoing environmental remediation requirements in which opc or its subsidiaries are involved 
four sites account for percent of the reserves associated with this group 
the four sites are an active refinery in louisiana where occidental indemnifies the current owner and operator for certain remedial actions  a water treatment facility at a former coal mine in pennsylvania  a closed chemical plant in pennsylvania and a former phosphorous processing and recovery facility in tennessee 
environmental costs occidental s costs  some of which may include estimates  relating to compliance with environmental laws and regulations  are shown below for each segment in millions operating expenses oil and gas chemical capital expenditures oil and gas chemical remediation expenses corporate operating expenses are incurred on a continual basis 
capital expenditures relate to longer lived improvements in currently operating facilities 
remediation expenses relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and do not contribute to current or future revenue generation 
although total costs may vary in any one year  over the long term  segment operating and capital expenditures for environmental compliance generally are expected to increase 
occidental presently estimates that capital expenditures for environmental compliance will be approximately million for and million for foreign investments portions of occidental s assets are located outside of north america 
at december   the carrying value of occidental s assets in countries outside north america aggregated approximately billion  or approximately percent of occidental s total assets at that date 
of such assets  approximately billion are located in the middle east north africa and approximately billion are located in latin america 
for the year ended december   net sales outside north america totaled billion  or approximately percent of total net sales 
critical accounting policies and estimates the process of preparing financial statements in accordance with gaap requires the management of occidental to make estimates and judgments regarding certain items and transactions 
it is possible that materially different amounts could be recorded if these estimates and judgments change or if the actual results differ from these estimates and judgments 
occidental considers the following to be its most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve the judgment of occidental s management 
there has been no material change to these policies over the past three years 
the selection and development of these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
oil and gas properties occidental uses the successful efforts method to account for its oil and gas properties 
under this method  costs of acquiring properties  costs of drilling successful exploration wells and development costs are capitalized 
the costs of exploratory wells are initially capitalized pending a determination of whether proved reserves have been found 
at the completion of drilling activities  the costs of exploratory wells remain capitalized if a determination is made that proved reserves have been found 
if no proved reserves have been found  the costs of each of the related exploratory wells are charged to expense 
in some cases  a determination of proved reserves cannot be made at the completion of drilling  requiring additional testing and evaluation of the wells 
occidental s practice is to expense the costs of such exploratory wells if a determination of proved reserves has not been made within a twelve month period after drilling is complete 
occidental has no proved oil and gas reserves for which the determination of commercial viability is subject to the completion of major additional capital expenditures 
annual lease rentals and geological  geophysical and seismic costs are expensed as incurred 
proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and ngls that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  can be recovered in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions considering future production and development costs 
several factors could change occidental s recorded oil and gas reserves 
occidental receives a share of production from pscs to recover its costs and an additional share for profit 
occidental s share of production and reserves from these contracts decreases when oil prices rise and increases when oil prices decline 
overall  occidental s net economic benefit from these contracts is greater at higher oil prices 
in other contractual arrangements  sustained lower product prices may lead to a situation where production of proved reserves becomes uneconomical 
estimation of future production and development costs is also subject to change partially due to factors beyond occidental s control  such as energy costs and inflation or deflation of oil field service costs 
these factors  in turn  could lead to changes in the quantity of recorded proved reserves 
an additional factor that could result in a change of proved reserves is the reservoir decline rates differing from those estimated when the reserves were initially recorded 
occidental s revisions to proved reserves were negative for and amounted to approximately percent of the total reserves for the year 
occidental s revisions to proved reserves were positive for and amounted to less than percent of the total reserves for the year 
in  revisions to proved reserves were negative and amounted to less than percent of the total reserves for the year 
occidental s revisions to proved reserves have been positive for seven of the last ten years 
additionally  occidental is required to perform impairment tests pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 generally when prices decline other than temporarily  reserve estimates change significantly or other significant events occur that may impact the ability to realize the recorded asset amounts 
if occidental s consolidated oil and gas reserves were to change based on the factors mentioned above  the most significant impact would be on the dd a rate 
for example  a percent increase in the amount of consolidated oil and gas reserves would change the rate from per barrel to per barrel  which would increase pre tax income by million annually 
a percent decrease in the oil and gas reserves would change the rate from per barrel to per barrel and would result in a decrease in pre tax income of million annually 
dd a of oil and gas producing properties is determined by the unit of production method and could change with revisions to estimated proved reserves 
the change in the dd a rate over the past three years due to revisions of previous proved reserve estimates has been immaterial 
a portion of the carrying value of occidental s oil and gas properties is attributable to unproved properties 
at december   the capitalized costs attributable to unproved properties  net of accumulated valuation allowance  were billion 
the unproved amounts are not subject to dd a or impairment until a determination is made as to the existence of proven reserves 
as exploration and development work progresses  if reserves on these properties are proven  capitalized costs attributable to the properties will be subject to depreciation and depletion 
if the exploration and development work were to be unsuccessful  the capitalized costs of the properties related to this unsuccessful work would be expensed in the year in which the determination was made 
the timing of any writedowns of these unproven properties  if warranted  depends upon the nature  timing and extent of future exploration and development activities and their results 
occidental believes its exploration and development efforts will allow it to realize the unproved property balance 
chemical assets the most critical accounting policy affecting occidental s chemical assets is the determination of the estimated useful lives of its pp e 
occidental s chemical plants are depreciated using either the unit of production or straight line method  based upon the estimated useful life of the facilities 
the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical assets  which range from years to years  are used to compute depreciation expense and are also used for impairment tests 
the estimated useful lives used for the chemical facilities are based on the assumption that occidental will provide an appropriate level of annual expenditures to ensure productive capacity is sustained 
without these continued expenditures  the useful lives of these plants could significantly decrease 
other factors that could change the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical plants include sustained higher or lower product prices  which are particularly affected by both domestic and foreign competition  feedstock costs  energy prices  environmental regulations and technological changes 
occidental performs impairment tests on its assets  per sfas no 
 whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction in the estimated useful lives or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable  or when management s plans change with respect to those assets 
occidental s net pp e for chemicals is approximately billion and its depreciation expense for is expected to be approximately million 
if the estimated useful lives of occidental s chemical plants were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above  the most significant impact would be on depreciation expense 
for example  a reduction in the remaining useful lives of one year would increase depreciation and reduce pre tax earnings by approximately million per year 
environmental liabilities and expenditures environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate 
reserves for estimated costs that relate to existing conditions caused by past operations and that do not contribute to current or future revenue generation are recorded when environmental remedial efforts are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
in determining the reserves and the reasonably possible range of loss  occidental refers to currently available information  including relevant past experience  available technology  regulations in effect  the timing of remediation and cost sharing arrangements 
the environmental reserves are based on management s estimate of the most likely cost to be incurred and are reviewed periodically and adjusted as additional or new information becomes available 
environmental reserves are recorded on a discounted basis only when a reserve is initially established and the aggregate amount of the estimated costs for a specific site and the timing of cash payments are reliably determinable 
the reserve methodology for a specific site is not modified once it has been established 
recoveries and reimbursements are recorded in income when receipt is probable 
as of december  and  occidental has not accrued any reimbursements or indemnification recoveries for environmental remediation matters as assets 
many factors could result in changes to occidental s environmental reserves and reasonably possible range of loss 
the most significant are the original cost estimate may have been inaccurate 
modified remedial measures might be necessary to achieve the required remediation results 
occidental generally assumes that the remedial objective can be achieved using the most cost effective technology reasonably expected to achieve that objective 
such technologies may include air sparging or phyto remediation of shallow groundwater  or limited surface soil removal or in situ treatment producing acceptable risk assessment results 
should such remedies fail to achieve remedial objectives  more intensive or costly measures may be required 
the remedial measure might take more or less time than originally anticipated to achieve the required contaminant reduction 
site specific time estimates can be affected by factors such as groundwater capture rates  anomalies in subsurface geology  interactions between or among water bearing zones and non water bearing zones  or the ability to identify and control contaminant sources 
the regulatory agency might ultimately reject or modify occidental s proposed remedial plan and insist upon a different course of action 
additionally  other events might occur that could affect occidental s future remediation costs  such as the discovery of more extensive contamination than had been originally anticipated 
for some sites with impacted groundwater  accurate definition of contaminant plumes requires years of monitoring data and computer modeling 
migration of contaminants may follow unexpected pathways along geologic anomalies that could initially go undetected 
additionally  the size of the area requiring remediation may change based upon risk assessment results following site characterization or interim remedial measures 
improved remediation technology might decrease the cost of remediation 
in particular  for groundwater remediation sites with projected long term operation and maintenance  the development of more effective treatment technology  or acceptance of alternative and more cost effective treatment methodologies such as bioremediation  could significantly affect remediation costs 
laws and regulations might change to impose more or less stringent remediation requirements 
at sites involving multiple parties  occidental provides environmental reserves based upon its expected share of liability 
when other parties are jointly liable  the financial viability of the parties  the degree of their commitment to participate and the consequences to occidental of their failure to participate are evaluated when estimating occidental s ultimate share of liability 
based on these factors  occidental believes that it will not be required to assume a share of liability of other potentially responsible parties  with whom it is alleged to be jointly liable  in an amount that would have a material effect on occidental s consolidated financial position  liquidity or results of operations 
most cost sharing arrangements with other parties fall into one of the following three categories category cercla or equivalent sites wherein occidental and other alleged potentially responsible parties share the cost of remediation in accordance with negotiated or prescribed allocations  category oil and gas joint ventures wherein each joint venture partner pays its proportionate share of remedial cost  or category contractual arrangements typically relating to purchases and sales of property wherein the parties to the transaction agree to methods of allocating the costs of environmental remediation 
in all three of these categories  occidental records as a reserve its expected net cost of remedial activities  as adjusted by recognition for any nonperforming parties 
in addition to the costs of investigating and implementing remedial measures  which often take in excess of ten years at cercla sites  occidental s reserves include management s estimates of the cost of operation and maintenance of remedial systems 
to the extent that the remedial systems are modified over time in response to significant changes in site specific data  laws  regulations  technologies or engineering estimates  occidental reviews and changes the reserves accordingly on a site specific basis 
if the environmental reserve balance were to either increase or decrease based on the factors mentioned above  the amount of the increase or decrease would be immediately recognized in earnings 
for example  if the reserve balance were to decrease by percent  occidental would record a pre tax gain of million 
if the reserve balance were to increase by percent  occidental would record an additional remediation expense of million 
other loss contingencies occidental is involved with numerous lawsuits  claims  proceedings and audits in the normal course of its operations 
occidental records a loss contingency for these matters when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in addition  occidental discloses  in aggregate  its exposure to loss in excess of the amount recorded on the balance sheet for these matters if it is reasonably possible that an additional material loss may be incurred 
occidental reviews its loss contingencies on an ongoing basis so that they are adequately reserved on the balance sheet 
these reserves are based on judgments made by management with respect to the likely outcome of these matters and are adjusted as appropriate 
management s judgments could change based on new information  changes in laws or regulations  changes in management s plans or intentions  the outcome of legal proceedings  settlements or other factors

derivative activities and market risk general occidental s market risk exposures relate primarily to commodity prices 
occidental has entered into derivative instrument transactions to reduce these price fluctuations 
a derivative is an instrument that  among other characteristics  derives its value from changes in another instrument or variable 
in general  the fair value recorded for derivative instruments is based on quoted market prices  dealer quotes and the black scholes or similar valuation models 
commodity price risk general occidental s results are sensitive to fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas prices 
based on current levels of production  if oil prices vary overall by per barrel  it would have an estimated annual effect on pre tax income of approximately million 
if domestic natural gas prices vary by per mcf  it would have an estimated annual effect on pre tax income of approximately million 
if production levels change in the future  the sensitivity of occidental s results to oil and gas prices also would change 
occidental s results are also sensitive to fluctuations in chemical prices  however  changes in cost usually offset part of the effect of price changes on margins 
if chlorine and caustic soda prices vary by ton  it would have a pre tax annual effect on income of approximately million and million  respectively 
if pvc prices vary by 
lb  it would have a pre tax annual effect on income of approximately million 
if ethylene dichloride edc prices vary by ton  it would have a pre tax annual effect on income of approximately million 
historically  product price changes either precede or follow raw material and feedstock product price changes  therefore  the margin improvement of price changes can be mitigated 
according to chemical market associates  inc  december average contract prices were chlorine ton  caustic soda ton  pvc lb and edc ton 
marketing and trading operations occidental periodically uses different types of derivative instruments to achieve the best prices for oil and gas 
derivatives have been used by occidental to reduce its exposure to price volatility and to mitigate fluctuations in commodity related cash flows 
occidental enters into low risk marketing and trading activities through its separate marketing organization  which operates under established policy controls and procedures 
with respect to derivatives used in its oil and gas marketing operations  occidental utilizes a combination of futures  forwards  options and swaps to offset various physical transactions 
occidental s use of derivatives in marketing and trading activities relates primarily to managing cash flows from third party purchases  which includes occidental s periodic gas storage activities 
risk management occidental conducts its risk management activities for energy commodities which include buying  selling  marketing  trading  and hedging activities under the controls and governance of its risk control policy 
the president and chief financial officer and the risk management committee  comprising members of occidental s management  oversee these controls  which are implemented and enforced by the trading control officer 
the trading control officer provides an independent and separate check on results of marketing and trading activities 
controls for energy commodities include limits on value at risk  limits on credit  limits on trading  segregation of duties  delegation of authority and a number of other policy and procedural controls 
fair value of marketing and trading derivative contracts the following tables reconcile the changes in the net fair value of occidental s marketing and trading contracts  a portion of which are hedges  during and  and segregate the open contracts at december  by maturity periods 
in millions fair value of contracts outstanding at beginning of year unrealized losses losses on contracts realized or otherwise settled during the year changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques and assumptions losses or other changes in fair value a fair value of contracts outstanding at end of year unrealized losses a primarily relates to price changes on existing production hedges

these prices are entered into an industry standard options pricing model to determine fair value 
production hedges in  occidental entered into a series of fixed price swaps and collar agreements that qualify as cash flow hedges for the sale of a portion of its crude oil production 
additionally  occidental acquired oil and gas fixed price and basis swaps with the vintage acquisition 
the fixed price swaps and the basis swaps expired in the collar agreements continue to the end of the volume that was hedged was less than percent of occidental s crude oil and natural gas production 
information about these cash flow hedges  which are included in the total fair value of million in the table above  is presented in a tabular presentation below as of december  volumes in thousands of barrels crude oil collars daily volume average floor average cap millions crude oil collars fair value liability quantitative information occidental uses value at risk to estimate the potential effects of changes in fair values of commodity based derivatives and commodity contracts used in marketing and trading activities 
this method determines the maximum potential negative short term change in fair value with a percent level of confidence 
the marketing and trading value at risk was immaterial during all of interest rate risk general occidental s exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to its long term debt obligations 
in  occidental terminated all of its interest rate swaps that were accounted for as fair value hedges 
these hedges had effectively converted approximately billion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
the fair value of the swaps at termination resulted in a gain of approximately million  which was recorded into income when the debt was paid in and the amount of interest expense recorded in the income statement was lower  as a result of the swaps and recognition of the gain  by approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
tabular presentation of interest rate risk in millions of us dollars  except rates the table below provides information about occidental s debt obligations which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
debt amounts represent principal payments by maturity date 
year of maturity us dollar fixed rate debt us dollar variable rate debt grand total a thereafter total average interest rate fair value a excludes unamortized net discounts of million 
credit risk occidental s energy contracts are spread among several counterparties 
creditworthiness is reviewed before doing business with a new counterparty and on an ongoing basis 
occidental monitors aggregated counterparty exposure relative to credit limits 
credit exposure for each customer is monitored for outstanding balances  current month activity  and forward mark to market exposure 
losses associated with credit risk have been immaterial for all years presented 
foreign currency risk a few of occidental s foreign operations have currency risk 
occidental manages its exposure primarily by balancing monetary assets and liabilities and maintaining cash positions in foreign currencies only at levels necessary for operating purposes 
most international crude oil sales are denominated in us dollars 
additionally  all of occidental s consolidated foreign oil and gas subsidiaries have the us dollar as the functional currency 
at december  and  occidental had not entered into any foreign currency derivative instruments 
the effect of exchange rates on transactions in foreign currencies is included in periodic income and is immaterial
