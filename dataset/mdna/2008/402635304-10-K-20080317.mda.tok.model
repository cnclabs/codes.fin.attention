item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations  estimates and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position 
actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in the sections entitled risk factors and cautionary note regarding forward looking statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company with our principal producing properties located along the louisiana gulf coast in the west cote blanche bay  or wcbb  and hackberry fields 
we have also recently acquired strategic assets in west texas in the permian basin 
we also hold a significant acreage position in the alberta oil sands in canada through our interest in grizzly oil sands ulc and have interests in entities that operate in southeast asia  including the phu horm gas field in thailand 
we seek to achieve reserve growth and increase our cash flow through our annual drilling programs 
highlights oil and natural gas revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for net income increased to million for the year ended december  from million for production increased to  boe for the year ended december  from  boe for we received net proceeds of approximately million from sales of our common stock in underwritten public offerings completed in february  may  july and december  after deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses 
these net proceeds were used to pay down existing debt under our credit facility and fund substantially all of the purchase price for the acquisition of certain strategic assets in west texas in the permian basin discussed in more detail below 
on december   we completed an acquisition of strategic assets in west texas in the permian basin for approximately million  effective as of november  in this transaction we acquired  net acres with production of approximately net boe a day from gross wells  predominately from the wolfcamp formation 
existing production is approximately oil  natural gas liquids and natural gas 
we have identified gross future development drilling locations 
we expect to net wells to be drilled on this acreage in the wells are expected to be drilled to approximately  feet at an estimated average gross completed well cost of million 
we funded this transaction predominately through a million common share offering  which closed on december  operations from these properties were included in our results of operations for only from the closing date of december  through december  during the third quarter of  we purchased a interest in grizzly oil sands ulc  a canadian unlimited liability company holding leases in the athabasca region located in northern alberta province  canada near fort mcmurray near other oil sands development projects 
as of december   our net investment in grizzly was approximately million 
as of december   grizzly had approximately  acres under lease 
grizzly drilled core holes during the winter delineation drilling season and tested three separate lease blocks with four

index to financial statements drilling rigs 
core hole samples have been collected and sent to a lab to assess the quantity and thickness of the bitumen in place on our acreage 
future plans currently include acquiring additional leases  drilling approximately to additional core holes and a seismic program during the winter drilling season  and initial planning for construction of a  barrel per day sagd facility as soon as  which could lead to initial production in estimated gross capital expenditures for a comparable production facility are approximately million 
during  we drilled wells and recompleted wells 
of our new wells drilled  were completed as producing wells and six were non productive 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates including those related to oil and natural gas properties  revenue recognition  income taxes and commitments and contingencies  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements oil and natural gas properties 
we use the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas operations 
accordingly  all costs  including non productive costs and certain general and administrative costs directly associated with acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties  are capitalized 
net capitalized costs are limited to the estimated future net revenues  after income taxes  discounted at per year  from proven oil and natural gas reserves and the cost of the properties not subject to amortization 
such capitalized costs  including the estimated future development costs and site remediation costs  if any  are depleted by an equivalent units of production method  converting gas to barrels at the ratio of six mcf of gas to one barrel of oil 
no gain or loss is recognized upon the disposal of oil and natural gas properties  unless such dispositions significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proven oil and natural gas reserves 
oil and natural gas properties not subject to amortization consist of the cost of undeveloped leaseholds and totaled  at december  and  at december  these costs are reviewed periodically by management for impairment  with the impairment provision included in the cost of oil and natural gas properties subject to amortization 
factors considered by management in its impairment assessment include our drilling results and those of other operators  the terms of oil and natural gas leases not held by production and available funds for exploration and development 
ceiling test 
companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of the oil and gas properties 
net capitalized costs are limited to the lower of unamortized cost net of deferred income taxes or the cost center ceiling 
the cost center ceiling is defined as the sum of a estimated future net revenues  discounted at per annum  from proved reserves  based on unescalated year end prices and costs  adjusted for any contract provisions or financial derivatives  if any  that hedge our oil and natural gas revenue  and excluding the estimated abandonment costs for properties with asset retirement obligations recorded on the balance sheet  b the cost of properties not being amortized  if any  and c the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties included in the cost being amortized  less income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the oil and natural gas properties 
if the net book value reduced by the related net deferred income tax liability exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or noncash writedown is required 
ceiling test impairment can give us a significant loss for a particular period  however  future depletion expense would be reduced 
a future decline in oil and gas prices may result in an impairment of oil and gas properties 

table of contents 
index to financial statements asset retirement obligations 
we have obligations to remove equipment and restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and associated production facilities 
we account for abandonment and restoration liabilities under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas no 
 which requires us to record a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated cost to retire an asset 
the asset retirement liability is recorded in the period in which the obligation meets the definition of a liability  which is generally when the asset is placed into service 
when the liability is initially recorded  we increase the carrying amount of the related long lived asset by an amount equal to the original liability 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related long lived asset 
upon settlement of the liability or the sale of the well  the liability is reversed 
these liability amounts may change because of changes in asset lives  estimated costs of abandonment or legal or statutory remediation requirements 
the fair value of the liability associated with these retirement obligations is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of the plugging and abandonment or retirement  annual inflations of these costs  the productive life of the asset and our risk adjusted cost to settle such obligations discounted using our credit adjustment risk free interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to the carrying amount of the related long lived asset  resulting in prospective changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion of discount 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long life of most of our oil and natural gas assets  the costs to ultimately retire these assets may vary significantly from previous estimates 
oil and gas reserve quantities 
our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that engineering and geological analysis demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
netherland  sewell associates  inc  pinnacle energy services  llc and to a lesser extent our personnel have prepared reserve reports of our reserve estimates on a well by well basis for our properties 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
our reserve estimates and the projected cash flows derived from these reserve estimates have been prepared in accordance with sec guidelines 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of many factors including the following the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
our proved reserve estimates are a function of many assumptions  all of which could deviate significantly from actual results 
as such  reserve estimates may materially vary from the ultimate quantities of oil and natural gas eventually recovered 
income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are based on enacted tax rates applicable to the future period when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income during the period the rate change is enacted 
deferred tax assets are recognized in the year in which realization becomes determinable 

table of contents 
index to financial statements periodically  management performs a forecast of its taxable income to determine whether it is more likely than not that a valuation allowance is needed  looking at both positive and negative factors 
a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets is established  if in management s opinion  it is more likely than not that some portion will not be realized 
at december   a valuation allowance of  had been provided for deferred tax assets based on the uncertainty of future taxable income 
revenue recognition 
we derive almost all of our revenue from the sale of crude oil and natural gas produced from our oil and gas properties 
revenue is recorded in the month the product is delivered to the purchaser 
we receive payment on substantially all of these sales from one to three months after delivery 
at the end of each month  we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers that month and the price we will receive 
variances between our estimated revenue and actual payment received for all prior months are recorded at the end of the quarter after payment is received 
historically  our actual payments have not significantly deviated from our accruals 
commitments and contingencies 
liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation or other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we are involved in certain litigation for which the outcome is uncertain 
changes in the certainty and the ability to reasonably estimate a loss amount  if any  may result in the recognition and subsequent payment of legal liabilities 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we seek to reduce our exposure to unfavorable changes in oil prices by utilizing energy swaps and collars  or fixed price contracts 
we follow the provisions of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
it requires that all derivative instruments be recognized as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet  measured at fair value 
we estimate the fair value of all derivative instruments using established index prices and other sources 
these values are based upon  among other things  futures prices  correlation between index prices and our realized prices  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values reported in the financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
designation is established at the inception of a derivative  but re designation is permitted 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges and meeting the effectiveness guidelines of sfas  changes in fair value are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
hedge effectiveness is measured at least quarterly based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
we recognize any change in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness immediately in earnings

such arrangements may expose us to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances where production is less than expected or oil prices increase 
these contracts require physical delivery of production quantities and are exempted from the provisions of sfas as normal sales of production 
results of operations results of operations the markets for oil and natural gas have historically been  and will continue to be  volatile

our recent capital commitments have been primarily for the development of our proved reserves  to increase our net acreage position in grizzly oil sands ulc and fund grizzly s delineation drilling program and for acquisitions  primarily our recently completed transaction in the permian basin 
our strategy is to continue to increase cash flow generated from our operations by undertaking new drilling  workover  sidetrack and recompletion projects to exploit our existing properties and explore other acquisition opportunities 
we have upgraded our infrastructure and our existing facilities with the goal of increasing operating efficiencies and volume capacities and lowering lease operating expenses 
these upgrades were also intended to better enable our facilities to withstand future hurricanes with less damage 
additionally  we completed the reprocessing of d seismic data in one of our principal properties  wcbb 
the reprocessed data enables our geophysicists to continue to generate new prospects and enhance existing prospects in the intermediate zones in the field  thus creating a portfolio of new drilling opportunities 
in addition  with our acquisition of strategic assets in the permian basin in west texas  we will also be required to pay of all drilling costs for future drilling activity on such properties

index to financial statements in our december  reserve reports  of our net reserves were categorized as proved undeveloped 
our proved reserves will generally decline as reserves are depleted  except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration or development activities or acquire properties containing proved developed reserves  or both 
to realize reserves and increase production  we must continue our exploratory drilling  undertake other replacement activities or use third parties to accomplish those activities 
our inventory of prospects includes approximately drilling locations at wcbb 
the drilling schedule used in our december  reserve report anticipates that all of those wells will be drilled by from january  through march   we drilled two wells and recompleted existing wells at our wcbb field 
we currently intend to spend a total of approximately to million for drilling  recompletion and other activities in our wcbb field during in our east hackberry field  from january  through march   we drilled one well and recompleted three wells 
we intend to drill three to five additional land wells and recomplete one additional well during total capital expenditures for our east hackberry field during are estimated at to million 
during the third quarter of  we purchased a interest in grizzly 
as of december   our net investment in grizzly was approximately million 
capital requirements in for this project are now estimated to be approximately to million  primarily for the expenses associated with our to well core hole drilling program  a seismic program and additional lease acquisitions 
capital expenditures in relating to our interest in thailand are expected to be approximately million  which we believe will be mostly offset from our share of production from the phu horm field 
capital expenditures in relating to our interest in the bakken shale in the williston basin are expected to be approximately million  which we believe will be partially offset from our share of production from the field 
we anticipate that our capital requirements for our properties in the permian basin in west texas purchased on december  will be approximately million during we have identified gross future development drilling locations 
we currently expect that approximately to net wells will be drilled on this acreage in our total capital expenditures for are currently estimated to be million 
we believe that our cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our normal recurring operating needs  debt service obligations  and our wcbb  hackberry  bakken  and permian basin capital requirements for the next twelve months 
in the event we elect to further expand or accelerate our drilling programs  pursue acquisitions or accelerate our canadian oil sands project  we will be required to obtain additional funds which we may do so through traditional borrowings  offerings of debt or equity securities or other means  including the sale of assets 
needed capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms  we may be required to delay or curtail implementation of our business plan or not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our revenues  operating results  profitability  future rate of growth and the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties depend primarily upon the prevailing prices for oil and natural gas 
historically  oil and natural gas prices have been volatile and are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors  including worldwide and domestic supplies of oil and natural gas  the level of prices  and expectations about future prices  of oil and natural gas  the cost of exploring for  developing  producing and delivering oil and natural gas  the expected rates of declining current production  weather conditions  including hurricanes  that can affect oil and natural gas operations over a wide area  the level of consumer demand  the price and availability of alternative fuels  technical advances affecting energy consumption  risks associated with operating drilling rigs  the availability of pipeline capacity  the price and level of foreign imports  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes  the ability of the members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  political instability or armed conflict in oil and natural gas producing regions  and the overall economic environment 

table of contents 
index to financial statements these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil and natural gas price movements with any certainty 
for example  over the last four years  the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil has ranged from a low of per barrel  or bbl  in january to a high of per bbl on march  the henry hub spot market price of natural gas has ranged from a low of per million british thermal units  or mmbtu  in october to a high of per mmbtu in october on december   the west texas intermediate posted price for crude oil was per bbl and the henry hub spot market price of natural gas was per mmbtu 
any substantial decline in the price of oil and natural gas will likely have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial condition and level of expenditures for the development of our oil and natural gas reserves  and may result in write downs of oil and natural gas properties due to ceiling test limitations

borrowings under our term loan with bank of america bear interest at bank of america prime at december  
based on the current debt structure  a increase in interest rates would increase interest expense by approximately  per year  based on an aggregate of million outstanding under our credit facilities as of december  as of december   we did not have any interest rate swaps to hedge our interest risks
