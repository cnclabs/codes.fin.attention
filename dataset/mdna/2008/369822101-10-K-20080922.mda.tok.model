item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations located elsewhere in this annual report on form k for a discussion of us and royal wolf as successor and predecessor  respectively 
on april  may in new zealand  royal wolf acquired the stock of rwnz acquisition co 
limited rwac and its wholly owned subsidiary  royalwolf trading new zealand rwnz  believed to be the largest marketer and lessor of storage containers in new zealand  for approximately million 
royal wolf is the leading provider in australia and new zealand of mobile storage containers  portable container buildings and freight containers  which we refer to as mobile storage or storage container products 
royal wolf leases and sells storage container products through its customer service centers which we refer to as cscs in australia and six in new zealand  which are located in every state in australia and the north and south islands of new zealand 
we believe royal wolf has the largest lease fleet of storage container products in australia and new zealand 
royal wolf is the only portable container lease and sales company with cscs in all major business centers in australia and new zealand and  as such  is the only company in australia and new zealand with a national infrastructure and work force 

table of contents royal wolf s storage container products are used by a broad range of industries 
our storage container products provide secure  accessible temporary storage for a diversified client base of over  large and small customers who conduct business in industries that include mining  road and rail  construction  moving and storage  manufacturing  transportation and defense 
our customers use our products for a wide variety of storage applications  including retail and manufacturing inventory  construction materials and equipment  documents and records and household goods 
we are pursuing strategies which include the growth of our leasing operations 
historically  royal wolf s revenue mix has been approximately sales and leasing  but by shifting priorities and incentives  supporting organic growth and by making subsequent acquisitions  our strategy is to focus on building the leasing component of our revenues 
we believe a leasing business with a fleet of storage container products has the following advantages recurring revenues from leases with an average duration of months  monthly lease rates that recoup our unit investment within an average of months  long useful asset lives exceeding years with low maintenance and high residual values  the ability to leverage the relatively fixed costs of our cscs to service a larger fleet of storage container products  and incremental leasing operating margins in excess of 
industry overview the storage industry includes two principal markets  fixed self storage and mobile storage 
the fixed self storage market consists of permanent structures located away from customer locations used primarily by consumers to temporarily store excess household goods 
although we have containers that are used for self storage on our sites and have sites that are focused on self storage such as auckland and christchurch in new zealand and tomago in australia  we do not participate in the fixed self storage market with permanent structures 
the mobile storage market  in which we operate  differs from the fixed self storage market in that it brings the storage solution to the customer s location and addresses the need for secure  temporary storage with immediate access to the storage unit 
the advantages of mobile storage include convenience  immediate accessibility  better security and lower costs 
in contrast to fixed self storage  the mobile storage market is primarily used by businesses 
mobile storage container market since the mid s  the storage container industry in australia and new zealand has developed into a stable market analogous to the marine container business of or years ago 
marine containerization displaced less efficient and more expensive specialized equipment 
we believe mobile storage containers are achieving increased market share compared to the other options because of an increasing awareness that containers provide ground level access  durable protection against damage caused by wind or water and custom modifications tailored to customers specific uses 
we are not aware of any published third party analysis of the australia and new zealand mobile storage container markets 
based upon internal analysis  royal wolf s management team estimates that the mobile storage market in australia and new zealand currently generates annual revenues of approximately million aus million  with an estimated derived from sales of mobile storage containers 
royal wolf s management team also anticipates that  as the market matures  rental revenue will account for an increasing proportion of the total revenue 

table of contents the mobile storage market has experienced steady growth since the mid s 
although there is no official forecast of industry growth rates or the future potential size market for mobile storage in australia and new zealand  we believe that a number of factors suggest that the market will continue to grow the level of knowledge among potential customers regarding the availability and benefits of containerized storage in key australia and new zealand markets  such as the construction and mining industries  is still relatively low  suppliers and customers continue to develop further uses for mobile storage containers  thereby broadening the market for mobile storage containers  and as the market leader in australia and new zealand  royal wolf has consistently achieved organic growth based  in part  on growth in the market as a whole 
royal wolf s competition in this market is regionalized and highly fragmented 
in most locations in australia  royal wolf competes with several national and regional competitors  including simply containers  cronos  macfield and anl cgm  as well as smaller  full and part time operators 
local competitors are regionally focused  and are usually more capital constrained 
therefore  in general  most are heavily reliant on monthly sales performance  have slowly growing rental fleets and have limited ability to transact larger deals 
the new zealand market is even more fragmented 
the following table lists royal wolf s principal competitors in the mobile storage container market in australia 
this information was compiled by royal wolf s management team based upon informal estimates and internal surveys of competitor rental fleet size  annual sales volumes and  where possible  external information such as competitor newsletters  placement of advertising in regional yellow pages and discussions with corporate customers and suppliers of used boxes  such as wholesalers  shipping lines and container fleet lessors 
we have no independent corroboration of this market information  and there is no assurance that this internally generated information is accurate or complete 
scope of competitor operations simply containers national macfield regional cronos national anl cgm national portable buildings market the portable buildings market in australia was estimated to have generated revenue totaling million aus million during the twelve month period ending june   of which approximately million aus million relates to the markets in which royal wolf offers a competing product  according to reports from ibis world industry report published in march the portable buildings market consists of the following engineering  construction and resources approximately 
non residential building construction approximately 
recreation and holiday market approximately 
within the engineering  construction and resources market  portable buildings are used for site offices  toilet and shower facilities  and worker housing and temporary accommodation blocks 
this market is influenced by trends in public and private sector spending on infrastructure  generally  and  particularly  mine development and road and pipeline construction 

table of contents demand from the non residential buildings market principally stems from the demand for work sheds  site offices  industrial garages and temporary warehousing 
demand can be significantly affected by special projects such as the commonwealth games hosted in australia 
the recreation and holiday market is increasingly becoming an important source of demand  particularly for the supply of fitted out cabins to be used as rental accommodations and second homes on purchased blocks of land 
growth in demand has been driven by growth in disposable income and increased leisure time associated with an aging population 
we believe that the portable buildings market will grow over the medium term  driven in part by a cyclical expansion in the mining and construction markets 
we also believe that differentiation and new portable building products such as the hazardous materials unit and containerized portable office and portable housing units introduced by royal wolf in will act as a stimulus for longer term growth in the market as older style products are replaced 
the lease and sale of containerized portable buildings have major advantages over traditional portable buildings in terms of transportability  security and flexibility  and we believe that this represents a significant market and growth opportunity for royal wolf 
in the portable buildings markets  royal wolf competes with three or four other large participants who manufacture their own units and most of whom offer units for both lease and sale to customers 
these competitors include coates  atco  ausco and nomad 
at present  royal wolf has a small presence in this market 
the major barrier to entry for new participants is the degree of market penetration necessary to create a wide profile with contractors and clients 
penetrating and competing with the range of products and number of depots and agencies offered by incumbent operators tends to inhibit new entrants 
as royal wolf already has a national sale and distribution network  established supply channels and a strong profile in its target markets  many of the barriers to entry applicable to other new entrants are not applicable to it 
the following table lists royal wolf s principal competitors in the australian portable buildings market scope of competitor operations coates national ausco national nomad national atco national freight container market based upon internal analysis  royal wolf s management team estimates that the freight container market in australia generates approximately million aus million in aggregate annual lease and sales revenues 
the rate of growth in this industry has been slow compared with the portable container storage and portable buildings market  which reflects the relative maturity of this industry 
although there is potential for growth in the freight container market as more road and rail carriers recognize the efficiencies of containerization  royal wolf s present strategy is to maintain rather than grow its container fleet investment and dependence upon this sector of its business activities 
competitors include macfield  cronos and simply containers 

table of contents the following table lists royal wolf s principal competitors in the australian freight container market scope of competitor operations macfield national cronos national simply containers national business strengths of royal wolf royal wolf is the leading provider of storage container products in australia and new zealand 
we believe this leading position is based upon the following strengths market leader 
with a lease fleet of approximately  containers  a sales inventory of approximately  containers and cscs located in every state in australia and in the north and south islands of new zealand  we believe royal wolf is the market leader in australia and new zealand for storage container products 
diversified customer base 
our storage container products provide secure  accessible temporary storage for a diversified client base of over  customers that includes large and small mining companies  road and rail businesses  construction companies  moving and storage providers  manufacturers  transportation businesses and the australian military 
experienced management team 
royal wolf has an experienced senior management team 
robert allan  the chief executive officer of royal wolf  has over years of experience in the equipment leasing industry 
the ten members of the senior management team of royal wolf have an average of over years of experience in the equipment leasing industry 
we believe the experience of this management team will be critical to growing royal wolf s business 
business strategy our business strategy consists of the following focus on mobile storage leasing business 
we focus on growing our core leasing business because it provides predictable  recurring revenue and high margins 
we believe that we can generate substantial demand for our storage container products throughout australia and new zealand 
royal wolf s leasing revenues grew from million in the year ended december  to million in the fiscal year ended june   reflecting a compound annual growth rate of over 
the container storage and portable building industry is relatively underdeveloped in australia and new zealand 
we believe the underdeveloped nature of the market presents significant growth opportunities for royal wolf 
although use for mobile storage  domestic freight movement and portable building applications is increasing  we believe there are many more uses for our storage container products still to be developed 
royal wolf s market opportunity is to fully develop and service these applications 
generate strong internal growth 
we define internal growth as an increase in lease revenues on a year over year basis at our branch locations in operation for at least one year  without inclusion of leasing revenue attributed to same market acquisitions 
we continue to focus on increasing the number of storage container units we lease from our existing branches to both new and repeat customers as well as changing the billing methodologies that are represented in the us market  such as billing in advance  a day billing cycle  fuel surcharges and a damage waiver program 
historically  we have been able to generate strong internal growth within our existing markets through sales and marketing programs designed to increase brand recognition  expand market awareness of the uses of mobile storage and differentiate our products from our competitors 

table of contents launch enhanced and innovative products 
we continue to enhance our existing products to meet our customers needs and requirements 
we have introduced new products and features that expand the applications and overall market for our storage products 
for example  in we introduced a foot wide storage unit that has proven to be a popular product with our customers 
in  we also introduced a new accommodation unit used in mining camps 
in  we introduced specialized products for the construction and engineering sectors as well as a blast resistant container unit for the refinery and energy sector 
leverage our infrastructure through acquisitions 
our branch network infrastructure covers a broad geographic area and is capable of serving additional volume at minimal levels of additional fixed costs 
our objective is to add volume by organically growing the lease fleet in these locations and through acquisitions 
asset purchases of tuck in competitors to existing branches or adding newly acquired fleets with branch locations in better locations can be very effective 
in addition  the corporate infrastructure of royal wolf is capable of managing existing fleets and locations in geographies outside of australia and new zealand  but within the asia pacific area 
from july through june  royal wolf completed four acquisitions on november  we acquired substantially all of the assets of ge seaco australia pty ltd 
geseaco for million 
the acquisition added more than  containers to royal wolf s fleet  of which  units are leased by approximately mid sized businesses and approximately national accounts serving such industries as road and rail  moving and storage and logistics 
prior to the acquisition  we believe ge seaco was the third largest storage container lessor in australia 
ge seaco exited the domestic container leasing market in australia through this transaction and the simultaneous sale of its tank container business 
royal wolf assumed several depot and agency contracts  including a third party sales agreement for intermodal containers from the ge seaco international fleet 
on february  we acquired the dry and refrigerated container assets of container hire and sales chs  located south of perth  australia for million 
with this acquisition  royal wolf added storage containers  of which approximately units were leased in the mining dominated western australia marketplace 
this acquisition ultimately consolidated with an existing csc in the bibra lakes suburb  south of perth 
on april  may in new zealand  we acquired rwnz acquisition co 
limited rwac and its wholly owned subsidiary royalwolf trading new zealand rwnz  believed to be the largest marketer and lessor of storage containers in new zealand  for approximately million 
through this acquisition royal wolf acquired more than  storage containers  of which approximately  storage containers were in the leasing fleet that are primarily delivered through five branches or customer service centers 
on june   we acquired storage containers from container hire storage pty ltd d b a tomago self storage in tomago  new south wales for approximately  as a result of these acquisitions and organic growth  royal wolf s lease fleet grew to  units as of june  
table of contents subsequent merger announcement on july   we announced the signing of a merger agreement among general finance  our wholly owned subsidiary  gfn north america corp 
gfna  mobile office acquisition corp 
moac and its subsidiary  pac van  inc pac van  and certain stockholders of moac in a transaction valued at million  plus the cost of any subsequent acquisitions by pac van 
pac van is a provider of modular buildings and mobile offices in the united states 
moac s stockholders are ronald l 
havner jr 
an over five percent beneficial owner of gfn  ronald f 
valenta our chief executive officer  laminar de shaw and pac van management employees 
a special committee made up of the independent members of our board of directors retained independent counsel and a financial advisor and negotiated and approved the merger  which is subject to approval of the our stockholders at a special meeting on september  and other customary closing conditions 
pac van  inc is headquartered in indianapolis  indiana and operates branch locations in states in the united states with more than  customers 
the transaction will establish general finance as a key player and provider of modular units and mobile storage solutions in north america and the asia pacific area with estimated combined annual revenues of approximately million 
pursuant to the merger agreement  the stockholders of moac will be entitled to receive up to million of cash   restricted shares of our common stock issued at per share with an aggregate value of million and a month subordinated promissory note in the aggregate principal amount of million or the note 
the note and million of the restricted stock will secure the indemnification obligations for months 
pursuant to the merger agreement  gfna will assume approximately million of pac van s indebtedness and will acquire all outstanding shares of moac 
we and the stockholders of moac will enter into several agreements  including a stockholders agreement which will provide registration rights with respect to the  restricted shares of common stock which may be exercised after june  pac van s indebtedness consists of approximately million outstanding under its senior secured credit facility and million outstanding under a senior subordinated promissory note

royal wolf s freight container products include curtain side  refrigerated and bulk cargo containers  together with a range of standard and industry specific dry freight containers 
the amount and percent of royal wolf s total sales and leasing of container revenues attributable to the market for the fiscal year ended june  were as follows in millions sales leasing containers in lease fleet product lives and durability most of our fleet is comprised of new and refurbished and customized storage containers  manufactured steel containers and record storage units  along with our freight and accommodation units 
these products are designed for long useful lives 
a portion of our fleet consists of used storage containers of eight to years in age  a time at which their useful life as ocean going shipping containers is over according to the standards promulgated by the international organization for standardization  which we refer to as iso 
because we do not have the same stacking and strength requirements that apply in the ocean going shipping industry  we have no need for these containers to meet iso standards 
we purchase these containers in large quantities  refurbish them by removing any rust and paint them with a rust inhibiting paint  and further customize them  and add our decals and branding 
we maintain our steel containers on a regular basis by painting them on average once every three to five years  removing rust  and occasionally replacing the wooden floor or a rusted panel 
this periodic maintenance keeps the container in good condition and is designed to maintain the unit s value and rental rates comparable to new units 

table of contents branch network royal wolf leases and sells its storage container products from an australia and new zealand network of cscs  the largest branch network of any company in australia and new zealand in the business of selling and leasing storage container products 
royal wolf is represented in all major metropolitan areas  and royal wolf is the only container leasing and sales company with a nationally integrated infrastructure and work force 
a typical royal wolf csc consists of a leased site of approximately two to five acres with a sales office  forklifts and all weather container repair workshop 
csc office staffing ranges from two to people and includes a branch manager supported by the appropriate level of sales  operations and administrative personnel 
yard and workshop staffing usually ranges between one and people and can consist of welders  spray painters  boilermakers  forklift drivers and production supervisors 
csc inventory holding ranges between and storage containers at any one time  depending on market size and throughput demand 
the following map shows royal wolf s existing csc locations map each branch has a branch manager who has overall supervisory responsibility for all activities of the branch 
branch managers report to one of our six regional managers 
our regional managers  in turn  report to our csc or retail manager 
performance based incentive bonuses are a portion of the compensation for the csc  regional and branch managers 
each branch has its own sales force  and we are introducing a transportation department that will deliver and pick up mobile storage units from customers in certain hub areas 
each branch has forklifts to load  transport and unload units and a storage yard staff responsible for unloading and stacking units 
steel units can be stored by stacking them three high to maximize usable ground area 
our larger branches also have a fleet maintenance department to make modifications to the containers and maintain the branch s forklifts and other equipment 
our smaller branches perform preventative maintenance tasks and outsource major repairs 
except for the auckland  new zealand self storage and regional office site  we lease all of our branch locations 
all of our major leased properties have remaining lease terms of between one month and years  and we believe that satisfactory alternative properties can be found in all of our markets  if we do not renew these existing leased properties 
we lease royal wolf s corporate and administrative offices in hornsby  new south wales 
these offices have approximately  square feet of office space 
the lease term expires november 
table of contents customers royal wolf has a broad base of over  active customers  with only four customers constituting more than of our annual revenue for the fiscal year ended june  our customer base includes the retail and manufacturing sectors  councils and government departments  the farming and agricultural community  the building and construction industry  clubs and sporting associations  the mining sector and the general public 
we believe the breadth of royal wolf s customer base reduces the business exposure to a downturn in any particular industry 
royal wolf provides its customers a solutions oriented approach  with high reliability in equipment quality and supply  with prompt and efficient delivery and pick up  and with superior service and product knowledge 
this is supported by a highly responsive national marketing team  in house finance  and control and engineering expertise and nationally linked fleet management and accounting systems 
royal wolf is the largest and only truly national supplier of container products in australia and new zealand  and the only container company with the scale and capacity to service a full range of customers  from small local accounts right through to the largest national businesses 
royal wolf s diverse customer base uses mobile storage containers for a variety of uses for the fiscal year ended june  pie chart rapid deployment storage for the military  emergency services and disaster relief  portable work camps for the resources industry  including accommodations  ablution and kitchen containers  low cost accommodations for remote communities and caravan parks  blast resistant containers for refineries  offices  workshops or storerooms in a growing range of sizes and configurations  temporary storage of excess inventory for the retail and wholesale industries  and farm storage for cattle feed  farm equipment  fertilizers and other items 
during the fiscal year ended june   our asset acquisition from ge seaco significantly increased our exposure in the transport sector 
we also enhanced our national accounts team with the addition of a focused group in construction  engineering and maintenance 

table of contents during the fiscal year ended june  sales of our storage container products to both the mining  construction and transport industries increased 
we believe the diversity of our customer base will allow us to take advantage of growth in a wide variety of industries 
employees as of june   royal wolf employed approximately full time employees in the following major categories management administrative sales and marketing operations in addition  we have two full time employees at our corporate office in pasadena  california 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good 
we have never experienced any material labor disruption  and we are not aware of any efforts or plans to unionize our employees 
sales and marketing royal wolf s sales and marketing strategy is designed to reach thousands of potential customers 
communication with potential customers is predominantly generated through a combination of yellow pages and print media advertising  phone sales and cold calling  web site  word of mouth  signage and decal awareness  walk ins and direct mail 
the customer hiring or buying process is being driven by customer awareness of the products combined with price shopping 
we believe that while a typical customer may shop a limited number of suppliers  the customer does not spend much time doing so because the potential cost savings is relatively low compared to the value of their time 
our goal is for royal wolf to be one of the suppliers that potential customers call 
product procurement royal wolf purchases marine cargo containers from a wide variety of international shipping lines and container leasing companies  plus new container products directly from storage container manufacturers in china 
we believe royal wolf is the largest buyer of both new and used storage container products for the australia and new zealand markets 
the majority of used storage containers purchased are standard foot and foot units which royal wolf converts  refurbishes or customizes 
royal wolf purchases new storage containers directly from container manufacturers 
each of the following material suppliers was the source of five percent or more of royal wolf s container purchases during the fiscal year ended june  suppliers type of product purchased percentage of container purchases nantong cimc new civet zhuhai container factory new shanghai baoshan new jiangsu wanlong special container new 
table of contents royal wolf purchases new storage container products under purchase orders issued to container manufacturers  which the manufacturers may or may not accept or be able to fill 
there are several alternative sources of supply for storage containers 
royal wolf is not dependent upon any one manufacturer and is able to purchase storage container products from a variety of suppliers 
the failure of one or more of its suppliers to timely deliver containers to royal wolf could adversely affect its operations 
if these suppliers do not timely fill royal wolf s purchase orders or do not properly manufacture the ordered products  royal wolf s reputation and financial condition also could be harmed 
in connection with the asset purchase from ge seaco in november  we entered into a preferred supply agreement with ge seaco 
under the preferred supply agreement  ge seaco has agreed to sell to us  and we have agreed to purchase  all of ge seaco s containers that ge seaco determines to sell  up to a maximum of  containers each year 
the purchase price for the containers will be based on their condition and is specified in the agreement  subject to annual adjustment 
in addition  we received a right of first refusal to purchase any additional containers that ge seaco desires to sell in australia  new zealand and papua new guinea 
either party may terminate the agreement upon no less than days prior notice at any time after november  approximately  units were purchased under this contract in the year ended june  fleet management royal wolf regularly needs to re locate containers between its cscs to meet peaks in regional demand and optimize inventory levels 
royal wolf has close relationships with the national road and rail hauling companies that enable it to transport the majority of containers interstate at attractive rates 
royal wolf s management information systems are instrumental to its fleet management and targeted marketing efforts 
fleet information is updated daily at the branch level which provides management with on line access to utilization  leasing and sale fleet unit levels and revenues by branch or geographic region 
management information and back office systems our management information systems  including the rmi and navision software programs  are scalable and provide us with critical information to manage our business 
utilizing our systems  we track a number of key operating and financial metrics including utilization  lease rates  customer trends and fleet data 
all our branches use rmi navision and our support office provides financial  inventory and customer reports for branch managers 
regulatory matters we must comply with various federal  state and local laws and regulations in connection with our operations 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with these laws and regulations 
in addition to compliance costs  we may incur costs related to alleged environmental damage associated with past or current properties owned or leased 
we believe that our liability  if any  for any environmental remediation will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  we cannot be certain that the discovery of currently unknown matters or conditions  new laws and regulations  or stricter interpretations of existing environmental laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the future 
in january  royal wolf was notified by a department of the australian government of an odor that might be caused by high levels of formaldehyde or volatile organic compounds that exceed national guidelines in some of its containers 
royal wolf engaged the services of independent consultants in cooperation with the australian government in testing ventilation improvements 
we believe that  based on their investigation and field test outcomes to date  the remediation of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows

item a 
risk factors in addition to risk factors included in this annual report on form k  you should also consider all the risks related to our business and operations following our acquisition of pac van  risks related to the acquisition and risk related to our substantial indebtedness as set forth in definitive proxy materials filed with the securities and exchange commission for a special meeting of stockholders to be held on september   as described under subsequent merger announcement in item risks related to our business our overall financial results will be affected by the relative value of the australian dollar to the us dollar and may be affected by other currencies with future acquisitions while the past two years have seen gains in the australian dollar relative to the us dollar  there is a likelihood that that trend will reverse 
if the australian dollar loses value against the us dollar then the value of the operating results and the value of the investment in australia will decline for financial reporting purposes and our overall financial results will be diminished 
future acquisitions in other countries may further impact the currency exchange impact on our financial results and may not be offset by increases in our us dollar based operations 
sales of storage container units constitute a significant portion of royal wolf s revenues 
failure to continue to sell units at historic levels could adversely affect our financial results and our ability to grow 
sales of storage container units and related modification revenues constituted approximately of royal wolf s total revenues for the fiscal year ended june  revenues from sales of storage container units have a material impact on our financial results and our ability to service our debt 
further  the funding of the growth of the container lease fleet is dependent upon the sales of storage container units to take advantage of business and growth opportunities available to it 

table of contents general or localized economic downturns or weakness may adversely affect royal wolf s customers  in particular those in the mining  transport and construction industries  which may reduce demand for royal wolf s products and services which would negatively impact our future revenues and results of operations 
a significant portion of royal wolf s revenues is derived from customers in industries and businesses that are cyclical in nature and subject to changes in general economic conditions  including the mining  transport and construction industries  which constituted approximately  and respectively  of royal wolf s revenues in the fiscal year ended june  although we believe the variety of royal wolf s products  the breadth of its customer base and its geographic diversity throughout australia and new zealand reduce its exposure to general economic or localized downturns  such downturns could reduce demand for royal wolf s products and negatively impact our future revenues and results of operations 
we may need additional debt or equity to sustain our growth  but we do not have commitments for such funds 
we finance our growth through a combination of borrowings  cash flow from operations and equity financing 
our ability to continue growing at the pace we have historically grown will depend in part on our ability to obtain either additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms and pricing 
the terms on which debt and equity financing is available to us varies from time to time and is influenced by our performance and by external factors  such as the economy generally and developments in the market  that are beyond our control 
also  additional debt financing or the sale of additional equity securities may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
if we are unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms  we may have to curtail our growth by delaying new branch openings  or  under certain circumstances  lease fleet expansion 
royal wolf faces significant competition in the portable buildings industry and regional competition in the portable storage market 
royal wolf also faces potentially significant competition from modular industry companies who have portable storage offerings  especially from national competitors in australia who have greater financial resources and pricing flexibility than royal wolf does 
if royal wolf is unable to compete successfully in these industries  it could lose customers and our future revenues could decline 
although royal wolf s competition varies significantly by market  the portable buildings market in which royal wolf competes is dominated by three or four large participants and is highly competitive 
in addition  royal wolf competes with a number of large to mid sized regional competitors  as well as many smaller  full and part time operators in many local regions 
the modular space industry is highly competitive and almost all of the competitors have portable storage product offerings 
the primary modular national competitors with portable storage offerings are less leveraged than royal wolf  and have greater financial resources and pricing flexibility than royal wolf does 
if they focus on portable storage  royal wolf could lose customers and our future revenues could decline 
if royal wolf is unable to compete successfully in these markets  it could lose customers and our future revenues could decline 
we may be required to take certain actions to satisfy bison capital s put option or our call option for bison capital s interest in gfn us prior to when we determine it would be feasible to do so 
we have entered into a shareholders agreement with bison capital with respect to our and bison capital s ownership interest in gfn us  which indirectly owns royal wolf 
under our shareholders agreement with bison capital  at any time after september   bison capital has the option to cause us to purchase from them all of its outstanding capital stock of gfn us also  under the shareholders agreement  we have the option to  at anytime prior to september   cause bison capital to sell and transfer its outstanding capital stock of gfn us to us 
if bison capital exercises its put option or if we exercise our call option under unfavorable market conditions  we may choose to take actions such as selling assets  seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures  in order to satisfy the payment to bison capital for its interest in gfn us any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
the failure of royal wolf to achieve its business strategy of increasing its leasing revenue could adversely affect the predictability of our quarterly earnings results and adversely affect our results of operations 
historically  sales of containers have been approximately of royal wolf s total revenues and leasing of containers has generated approximately of total revenues 
we are pursuing a strategy of increasing revenue generated from leasing operations 
revenues generated from sales can vary greatly from quarter to quarter  while revenue from leasing operations is more predictable 
if we are not successful in increasing the percentage of our revenues generated by our leasing operations  our results of operations may vary greatly quarter to quarter  and would therefore be less predictable 
in addition  if we are not successful in increasing the percentage of our revenues from our leasing operations  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
our customers lease our storage container products on a month to month basis  and our results of operations could be adversely affected by a downturn in economic activity 
should a significant number of royal wolf s storage container products be returned by customers during a short period of time  royal wolf would have to lease a large supply of units to new customers at similar rates in order to maintain historic revenues from these operations 
royal wolf s failure to effectively lease to new customers a large influx of units returned by customers from leases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents the supply and cost of used ocean going containers fluctuates  which fluctuation could affect royal wolf s pricing and our ability to grow 
royal wolf currently purchases  refurbishes and modifies used ocean going containers in order to replenish and expand its lease fleet 
various freight transportation companies  freight forwarders and commercial and retail storage companies also purchase used ocean going containers 
many of these other companies have greater financial resources than royal wolf does 
as a result  if the number of available containers for sale decreases  these competitors may be better able to absorb an increase in the cost of containers 
if used ocean going container prices increase substantially  royal wolf may not be able to purchase enough new units to maintain or increase the size of its fleet 
these price increases also could increase royal wolf s acquisition costs and operating expenses and adversely affect our results of operations and reduce our earnings 
conversely  an oversupply of used ocean going containers may cause container prices to fall  which may result in competitors then lowering the lease rates on their storage units 
as a result  royal wolf may need to lower its lease rates to remain competitive  which would cause our future revenues to decline 
governmental regulations could impose substantial costs and restrictions on royal wolf s operations that could harm our future results of operations 
royal wolf is subject to various australia and new zealand federal  state and local environmental  transportation  health and safety laws and regulations in connection with its operations 
any failure to comply with these laws or regulations could result in capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of severe penalties or restrictions on its operations or reductions or delays in sales of storage container products 
in addition  these laws and regulations could change in a manner that materially and adversely affects royal wolf s ability to conduct its business 
more burdensome regulatory requirements in these or other areas may increase our general and administrative costs 
if royal wolf is unable to pass these increased costs on to its customers  our future operating results could be negatively impacted 
royal wolf may not be able to facilitate its growth strategy by identifying or completing transactions with attractive acquisition candidates  which could impair the growth and profitability of its business 
an important element of our growth strategy for royal wolf is to continue to seek additional acquisitions in order to add new leasing customers within existing geographic markets and branch locations and to expand royal wolf s operations into new markets 
any future growth through acquisitions will be partially dependent upon the continued availability of suitable acquisition candidates at favorable prices  upon advantageous terms and conditions and upon successful integration of the acquired businesses 
however  future acquisitions may not be available at advantageous prices or upon favorable terms and conditions 
in addition  acquisitions involve risks that the businesses acquired will not perform in accordance with expectations  that business judgments concerning the value  strengths and weaknesses of businesses acquired will prove incorrect  that the acquired businesses may not be integrated successfully and that the acquisitions may strain royal wolf s management resources 
future acquisitions and any necessary related financings also may involve significant transaction related expenses 
if royal wolf is unable to complete additional acquisitions or successfully integrate any businesses that it does acquire  our future growth and operating results would be adversely impacted 
there is no assurance that we or royal wolf will be able to identify  negotiate or complete any future acquisitions  or  if completed that any such acquisitions will be successful 
failure to retain key personnel could adversely affect royal wolf s operations and could impede our ability to execute our business plan and growth strategy 
royal wolf is managed largely by its existing officers  including robert allan  its chief executive officer  and peter mccann  its chief financial officer 
the continued success of royal wolf will depend largely on the efforts and abilities of these executive officers and certain other key employees 
the ten members of the senior management team of royal wolf have an average of over years of experience in the equipment leasing industry 
these officers and employees have knowledge and an understanding of royal wolf and its industry that cannot be readily duplicated 
each of messrs 
allan and mccann has an employment agreement which is terminable under certain circumstances upon notice to him 
however  we do not have key man insurance on any of these key personnel 
the loss of any member of royal wolf s senior management team could impair our ability to execute our business plan and growth strategy  cause a loss of customers  reduce revenues and adversely affect employee morale 

table of contents any failure of royal wolf s management information systems could disrupt our business and result in decreased lease or sale revenues and increased overhead costs  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
royal wolf depends on its management information systems to actively manage its lease fleet  control new unit capital spending and provide fleet information  including leasing history  condition and availability of our units 
these functions enhance royal wolf s ability to optimize fleet utilization  lease fleet condition and redeployment 
the failure of royal wolf s management information systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt its business and could result in  among other things  decreased leases or sales and increased overhead costs  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
a write off of all or a part of our goodwill and intangibles would hurt our operating results and reduce our stockholders equity 
as a result of our acquisition of royal wolf and subsequent acquisitions  we have recorded significant intangible assets related to goodwill  which represent the excess of the total purchase price of the acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we are not permitted to amortize goodwill under the us accounting standards and instead are required to review goodwill and other non amortizable intangibles at least annually for impairment 
in the event impairment is identified  a charge to earnings would be recorded 
although it does not affect our cash flow  a write off in future periods of all or a part of our goodwill or intangibles would hurt our operating results and stockholders equity 
we are unable to currently estimate if and when it may become necessary to write off goodwill or intangibles or the effect such a write off may have on our financial results or the market prices of our securities 
significant increases in raw material costs could increase our operating costs significantly and harm our stockholders equity 
royal wolf purchases raw materials  including metals  lumber  siding and roofing and other products  to perform periodic refurbishment of its units and to modify containers to its customers requirements 
during periods of rising prices for raw materials  and in particular when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal  we may incur significant increases in our operating costs and may not be able to pass price increases through to our customers in a timely manner  which could harm our future results of operations 
failure by chinese manufacturers to sell and deliver products to royal wolf in timely fashion may harm royal wolf s reputation and our financial condition 
royal wolf currently purchases new storage container products directly from container manufacturers in china 
although royal wolf is not dependent on any one manufacturer and is able to purchase products from a variety of suppliers  the failure of one or more of its suppliers to timely manufacture and deliver containers to royal wolf could adversely affect its operations 
royal wolf purchases new storage container products under purchase orders issued to container manufacturers  which the manufacturers may or may not accept or be able to fill 
royal wolf has no contracts with any supplier 
if these suppliers do not timely fill royal wolf s purchase orders  or do not properly manufacture the ordered products  our reputation and financial condition also could be harmed 
some zoning laws restrict the use of royal wolf s storage container units and therefore limit its ability to offer its products in all markets 
most of royal wolf s customers use royal wolf s storage container units to store goods on their own properties 
local zoning laws in some of royal wolf s geographic markets prohibit customers from maintaining portable storage units on their properties or require that portable storage units be located out of sight from the street 
if local zoning laws in one or more of royal wolf s geographic markets were to ban or restrict portable storage units stored on customers sites  royal wolf s business in that market will suffer 
unionization by some or all of royal wolf s employees could cause increases in operating costs 
royal wolf s employees are not presently covered by collective bargaining agreements 
however  from time to time various unions have attempted to unionize some of royal wolf s employees 
we are unable to predict the outcome of any continuing or future efforts to unionize royal wolf s employees  the terms of any future labor agreements  or the effect  if any  those agreements might have on our operations or financial performance 

table of contents we may not take certain actions with respect to royal wolf without the written consent of bison capital  as the holder of of the outstanding capital stock of gfn us  which indirectly owns royal wolf 
under the shareholders agreement  neither gfn us nor royal wolf may take certain actions without the written consent of bison capital  including  without limitation  selling material assets outside the ordinary course of business  entering into transactions with gfn  issuing capital stock to gfn without offering a pro rata share to bison capital  issuing capital stock to a third party  issuing subordinated debt to any person without offering bison its pro rata share  paying dividends or  with certain exceptions  make other payments to gfn  changing the nature of the business  merging with any person that results in a change of control  or acquiring any business if the purchase price and assumed debt exceeds million 
under our shareholders agreement with bison capital  we have agreed to acquire businesses comparable with royal wolf in a certain geographic territory solely through royal wolf 
under our shareholders agreement with bison capital  we have agreed to acquire businesses engaged in the sale and lease of portable storage containers  portable container buildings and freight containers in certain geographic territory solely through royal wolf 
the geographic territory is that part of the world south of guam  west of hawaii and east of viet nam 
covenants in our debt instruments restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into a variety of transactions 
the agreements governing our secured senior subordinated note with bison capital and our secured credit facility with australian and new zealand banking group limited contain various covenants that may limit our discretion in operating our business 
in particular  we are limited in our ability to merge  consolidate or transfer substantially all of our assets  issue preferred stock of subsidiaries and create liens on our assets to secure debt 
in addition  if there is default  and we do not comply with certain financial covenants or maintain borrowing availability in excess of certain pre determined levels  we may be unable to incur additional indebtedness  make restricted payments including paying cash dividends on our capital stock or redeem or repurchase our capital stock 
our secured credit facility requires us  under certain limited circumstances  to maintain certain financial ratios and limits our ability to make capital expenditures 
these covenants and ratios could have an adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing  merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities and to fund our operations 
breach of a covenant in our debt instruments could cause acceleration of a significant portion of our outstanding indebtedness 
any future debt could also contain financial and other covenants more restrictive than those imposed under the agreements governing the secured senior subordinated note and the secured credit facility 
a breach of a covenant or other provision in any debt instrument governing our current or future indebtedness could result in a default under that instrument and  due to cross default and cross acceleration provisions  could result in a default under our other debt instruments 
upon the occurrence of an event of default under the secured credit facility or any other debt instrument  the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
if we were unable to repay those amounts  the lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them  if any  to secure the indebtedness 
if the lenders under our current or future indebtedness accelerate the payment of the indebtedness  we cannot assure you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to repay in full our outstanding indebtedness 
the amount we can borrow under our secured credit facility depends in part on the value of the portable storage units in our lease fleet 
if the value of our lease fleet declines  the amount we are able to borrow may decline 
we are required to satisfy several covenants with our lenders that are affected by changes in the value of our container for lease fleet 
we would breach some of these covenants if the value of our lease fleet drops below specified levels 
if this happens  we may not be able to borrow the amounts we need to expand our business  and we may be forced to liquidate a portion of our existing fleet 
gfn or its subsidiaries operations may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to its meet debt service obligations 
gfn or its subsidiaries ability to make payments on its indebtedness will depend on its ability to generate cash from operations 
the business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable it to repay gfn or its subsidiaries indebtedness and to fund other liquidity needs  including capital expenditure requirements 
the indebtedness to be incurred by gfn or its subsidiaries under the secured credit facility will bear interest at variable rates  and therefore if interest rates increase  gfn or its subsidiaries debt service requirements will increase 
in such case  gfn or its subsidiaries may need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity 
gfn or its subsidiaries may not be able to refinance any of its indebtedness  including the new credit facility  on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
if gfn or its subsidiaries cannot service or refinance its indebtedness  it may have to take actions such as selling assets  seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 

table of contents ronald f 
valenta and john o 
johnson allocate some portion of their time to other businesses  which could cause conflicts of interest in their allocation of time to our affairs 
these conflicts of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to function as an operating company and consummate future acquisitions 
our ability to be successful may depend on the efforts of ronald f 
valenta and john o 
johnson 
neither ronald f 
valenta  our chief executive officer  nor john o 
johnson  our chief operating officer  devotes or is required to devote his full time to our affairs 
this could create a conflict of interest when allocating their time between our operations and their other commitments 
these executive officers are engaged in several other business endeavors and are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our affairs 
if these executive officers other business affairs require them to devote more substantial amounts of time to such affairs  it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs and could have a negative impact on our ability to function as an operating company and consummate future business combinations 
mr 
valenta has significant experience and contacts in owning  operating and acquiring companies in the business of equipment sales and leasing  our present business 
mr 
johnson has significant experience in acquisitions  and part of our strategy is to acquire additional businesses engaged in equipment sales and leasing 
neither mr 
valenta nor mr 
johnson has an employment agreement with us  and they are not currently compensated for their services  although mr 
valenta and mr 
johnson currently beneficially own approximately and  respectively  of our outstanding common stock 
mr 
johnson and mr 
valenta intend to serve in their current capacities without compensation and employment agreement until october  and january   respectively

valenta is affiliated with companies in the specialty finance business  which could create a conflict of interest in decisions affecting our business 
ronald f 
valenta  a director and our chief executive officer  is also affiliated with other companies in the specialty finance industry 
among them  he is a director of and the chairman of the board of directors of moac  the parent company of pac van  a us office modular and portable storage company that we are attempting to acquire  as described under subsequent merger announcement in item risks associated with future acquisitions to complete future business combinations  we may issue shares of our capital stock that would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and could cause a change in control of our ownership  or incur debt  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares of common stock and up to  shares of preferred stock 
at june   there were  authorized shares of our common stock available for issuance after appropriate reservation for the issuance of shares upon full exercise of our outstanding warrants and options that may be issued under our stock option plan 
if we seek to consummate future business combinations  we may be required to issue a substantial number of additional shares of our common or preferred stock  or a combination of common and preferred stock  to complete the other business combination 
the issuance of additional shares of our common stock or any number of shares of our preferred stock may significantly reduce the equity interest of investors  may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded to our common stock  will likely cause a change in control if a substantial number of our shares of common stock are issued  which may affect  among other things  our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards  if any  and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors  and may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
in addition  we may incur substantial debt to complete another business combination 
the incurrence of debt could result in default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations  acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves are breached without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant  our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest  if any  if the debt security is payable on demand  and our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security instrument covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt instrument is outstanding 

table of contents while part of our business strategy is to acquire additional businesses  there is no assurance that we will be able to identify businesses that we can acquire upon terms we believe acceptable  or if such acquisitions require additional financing  that we could obtain such additional financing 
if we do seek to complete other acquisitions  we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for other future transactions 
we cannot assure you that  if required  additional financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
to the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate a particular acquisition  we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular acquisition 
in addition  if we consummate a future acquisition  we may require additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business 
the failure to secure additional financing may impact the continued development or growth of the target business 
our growth plan includes the expansion of royal wolf s operations into markets outside of australia and new zealand  including asia pacific areas 
such international expansion may not prove successful  and may divert significant capital  resources and management s time and attention and adversely affect royal wolf s on going operations in australia and new zealand 
to date  royal wolf has conducted all of its business within australia and new zealand 
however  royal wolf has plans to enter international markets  including the asia pacific area  in the future  which will require meaningful amounts of management time and attention 
royal wolf s products and its overall marketing approach may not be accepted in other markets to the extent needed to make its international expansion profitable 
in addition  the additional demands on its management from these activities may detract from royal wolf s efforts in the australian and new zealand markets and adversely affect its operating results in its principal market 
any international expansion will expose royal wolf to the risks normally associated with conducting international business operations  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  changes in foreign legislation  possible foreign currency controls  currency exchange rate fluctuations or devaluations  tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  difficulties in obtaining and managing vendors and distributors  potential negative tax consequences and difficulties collecting accounts receivable 
royal wolf s planned growth could strain our management resources  which could disrupt our development of new royal wolf cscs 
our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to manage royal wolf s planned growth 
royal wolf s growth could strain our existing management  human and other resources 
to successfully manage this growth  we must continue to add managers and employees and improve royal wolf s operating  financial and other internal procedures and controls 
we also must effectively motivate  train and manage royal wolf s employees 
if we do not manage royal wolf s growth effectively  some of its new cscs and acquisitions may lose money or fail  and we may have to close unprofitable locations 
closing a csc would likely result in additional expenses that would adversely affect our future operating results future acquisitions of businesses could subject us to additional business  operating and industry risks  the impact of which cannot presently be evaluated  and could adversely impact our capital structure 
we intend to pursue additional acquisition opportunities in an effort to diversify our investments and or grow our business 
any business we acquire may cause us to be affected by numerous risks inherent in the acquired business s operations 
if we acquire a business in an industry characterized by a high level of risk  we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that industry 
although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular industry or target business  we cannot assure you that we will be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors 
in addition  the financing of any acquisition we complete could adversely impact our capital structure as any such financing would likely include the issuance of additional equity securities and or the borrowing of additional funds 
the issuance of additional equity securities may significantly reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and or adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
increasing our indebtedness could increase the risk of a default that would entitle the holder to declare all of such indebtedness due and payable and or to seize any collateral securing the indebtedness 
in addition  default under one debt instrument could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those other instruments to be due and payable pursuant to cross default clauses 
accordingly  the financing of future acquisitions could adversely impact our capital structure and your equity interest in our company 
except as required by law or the rules of any securities exchange on which our securities might be listed at the time we seek to consummate a subsequent acquisition  you will not be asked to vote on any such proposed acquisition and no redemption rights in connection with any such acquisition will exist 
risks associated with our warrants our outstanding options and warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of common stock and increase the difficulty of effecting future business combination 
at june   we had outstanding options and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the potential for the issuance of substantial numbers of additional shares of common stock upon exercise of these warrants and options could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle in the eyes of a target business 
such securities  when exercised  will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of our common stock and reduce the value of the shares issued 
additionally  the sale  or even the possibility of sale  of the shares underlying the warrants and options could have an adverse effect on the market price for our securities or on our ability to obtain future financing 

table of contents we may choose to redeem outstanding warrants at a time that it is disadvantageous to our warrant holders 
subject to there being a current prospectus under the securities act of  as amended  with respect to the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants issued as a part of the units in our initial public offering  we may redeem the warrants at any time after the warrants become exercisable  in whole and not in part  at a price of 
per warrant  upon a minimum of days prior written notice of redemption  if and only if  the last sales price of our common stock equals or exceeds per share for any trading days within a trading day period ending three business days before the notice of redemption is sent 
we may also elect to reduce the warrant price in our sole discretion to encourage warrant holders to exercise their warrants to purchase our common stock 
redemption of the warrants could force the warrant holders i to exercise the warrants and pay the exercise price therefore at a time when it may be disadvantageous for the holders to do so  ii to sell the warrants at the then current market price when they might otherwise wish to hold the warrants  or iii to accept the nominal redemption price which  at the time the warrants are called for redemption  is likely to be substantially less than the market value of the warrants 
although we are required to and intend to use our best efforts to have an effective registration statement covering the issuance of the shares underlying the warrants issued in our ipo at the time that the warrant holders exercise their warrants  we cannot guarantee that a registration statement will be effective  in which case the warrant holders may not be able to exercise their warrants 
holders of the warrants issued in our ipo will be able to receive shares upon exercise of the warrants only if i a current registration statement under the securities act of relating to the shares of common stock underlying the warrants is then effective and ii such shares are qualified for sale or exempt from qualification under the applicable securities laws of the states in which the various holders of warrants reside 
although we have agreed in the warrant agreement  and therefore have a contractual obligation  to use our best efforts to maintain a current registration statement covering the shares underlying the warrants to the extent required by federal securities laws  and we intend to comply with such agreement  we cannot give assurance that we will be able to do so 
in addition  some states may not permit us to register the shares issuable upon exercise of our warrants for sale 
the value of the warrants will be greatly reduced if a registration statement covering the shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants is not kept current or if the securities are not qualified  or exempt from qualification  in the states in which the holders of warrants reside 
holders of warrants who reside in jurisdictions in which the shares underlying the warrants are not qualified and in which there is no exemption will be unable to exercise their warrants and would either have to sell their warrants in the open market or allow them to expire unexercised 
if and when the warrants become redeemable by us  we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws 
the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  which may make it difficult for shareholders to resell common stock when they want or at a price they find attractive 
we expect that the market price of our common stock will fluctuate 
our common stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  changes in interest rates and other general economic conditions  significant acquisitions or business combinations  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us  news reports relating to trends  concerns  litigation  regulatory changes and other issues in our industry  geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts  and relatively low trading volume 
if equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock  the price of our common stock could decline 
the trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business 
we do not control these analysts 
the price of our stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business 
we do not currently intend to pay dividends  which may limit the return on your investment in us 
we currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future

table of contents year ended june  fy compared to year ended june  fy we had no business or operations prior to our acquisition of royal wolf on september  comparisons of our results of operations for fy with fy therefore are not particularly meaningful

this increase was due to growth in revenues from sales of containers in our retail operations of million  sales of million in our national accounts group or non retail operations and million due to favorable foreign exchange rates

the million increase in our national accounts group operations consisted of million due to higher unit sales and million due to price increases 
leasing of container revenues during fy amounted to million compared to million during fy  representing an increase of million  or

as a percentage of revenues  operating expenses at royal wolf decreased to in fy from not including the net effect of share based payment in march in fy depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million to million during fy compared to million during fy the increase was primarily the result of adjustments to fair values of fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets as a result of acquisitions 
the amortization of identifiable intangible assets customer lists and non compete agreements represented approximately million of this increase 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of fy  royal wolf revised the estimated useful life and residual value of its containers for lease fleet 
the financial impact of the revision resulted in depreciation expense for fy being million less than what it would have been if the previous useful life estimate had been applied 

table of contents interest income

the increase in interest expense of million in fy  as compared to fy  was due primarily to an increase in total long term debt  which was million at june  and million at june  the increase in total debt in fy was due primarily to our acquisitions of royal wolf  ge seaco  chs  rwnz and tomago  funded principally with the senior credit facility with australia and new zealand banking group limited  or anz  and the secured senior subordinated notes issued to bison capital 
foreign currency exchange 
as a result of the acquisition of royal wolf  we now have certain us dollar denominated debt at royal wolf  including intercompany borrowings  which are remeasured at each financial reporting date with the impact of the remeasurement being recorded in our consolidated statements of operations 
we had foreign currency exchange gains of approximately million in fy because the australian dollar strengthened against the us dollar during fy as compared to fy effective october   the foreign exchange effect of the principal balance of the us dollar denominated intercompany borrowings are now included in accumulated other comprehensive income since we do not expect repayment in the foreseeable future 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate decreased to during the fy as a result of certain non deductible amounts included in the fy for australian income tax purposes being extinguished and the amortization of goodwill for us income tax reporting purposes being deductible in fy net income 
we had net income of million during fy compared to net income of million during fy primarily as a result of increased revenues from the sales and leasing of containers in fy  the fact that fy included share based expense of approximately million and the favorable impact of the foreign currency exchange gain  offset somewhat by increased interest expense

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by million to million during fy compared to million during fy during the fourth quarter of fy  royal wolf revised the estimated useful life and residual value of its containers for lease fleet 
the financial impact of the revision resulted in depreciation expense for fy being million less than what it would have been if the previous useful life estimate had been applied 
the financial impact of the revision in future periods cannot be reliably estimated due to the uncertainty over the timing of sales of existing containers and the purchases of new containers

in addition  during fy  we commenced recording purchases of containers directly into inventory rather than initially into fixed assets  which increased the inventory balance by approximately million at june  from june  property  plant and equipment increased from million at june  to million at june   primarily due to the step up to fair value in the basis of the fixed assets as a result of the purchase accounting adjustments in connection with our acquisition of royal wolf and the acquisition of rwnz

long term debt  including current portion  increased from million at june  to million at june   primarily due to the acquisitions of royal wolf  ge seaco  chs and tomago 
these acquisitions were funded in large part by borrowings on the anz senior credit facility and the issuance of the secured senior subordinated notes to bison capital 
reference is made to note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our long term debt 
we believe that our cash on hand and cash flow provided by operations will be adequate in the foreseeable future to cover our working capital  debt service requirements and a certain portion of our planned capital expenditures  to the extent such items are known or are reasonably determinable  based on current business and market conditions 
we expect to finance our capital expenditure requirements primarily under our anz senior credit facility or through capital lease agreements 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and we expect that any future acquisitions will be funded through cash flow provided by operations and by additional borrowings under our anz senior credit facility 
however  we are continually seeking and evaluating additional sources of capital  particularly a source of funding that will enable us to exercise our call option for bison capital s minority interest in gfn us prior to september

royal wolf also financed a smaller portion of its capital requirements through capital leases and lease purchase contracts 
operating activities 
operations provided net cash flow of million for fy compared to million during the fy the million decrease is primarily related to cash management needs from royal wolf s growth that resulted in a significant satisfaction of payables and increase in receivables that more than offset a million increase in net income 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fy compared to million for fy capital expenditures for our lease fleet  net of proceeds from sale of lease fleet units  were million for fy and million for fy the capital expenditures for the lease fleet are primarily due to continued demand  requiring the purchase and refurbishment of more containers and portable buildings

table of contents contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of june  payment due by fiscal year ending june  and contractual obligations total thereafter in thousands capital leases obligations  including interest operating leases long term debt principal long term debt interest total off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet transactions  arrangements  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or others that are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
seasonality although demand from certain specific customer segments can be seasonal  our operations as a whole are not seasonal to any significant extent 
we experience a reduction in sales volumes during australia s summer holiday break from mid december to the end of january  followed by february being a short working day month 
however  this reduction in sales typically is counterbalanced by the increased lease revenues derived from the relocations industry  which experiences its seasonal peak of personnel relocations during this same summer holiday break 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our business 
however  during periods of rising prices for raw materials  and in particular when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal  we may incur significant increases in our operating costs and may not be able to pass price increases through to our customers in a timely manner  which could harm our future results of operations 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate all of our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods 
we believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we are required to estimate the collectability of our trade receivables 
accordingly  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
on a recurring basis  we evaluate a variety of factors in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of our customers  its days outstanding trends  a review of historical collection results and a review of specific past due receivables 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  resulting in decreased net income 
to date  uncollectible accounts have been within the range of our expectations 
we lease and sell portable storage containers to our customers 
leases to customers are generally on a short term basis qualifying as operating leases 
the aggregate lease payments are generally less than the purchase price of the equipment 
revenue is recognized as earned in accordance with the lease terms established by the lease agreements and when collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue from sales of equipment is recognized upon delivery and when collectability is reasonably assured 
we have a fleet of storage containers that we lease to customers under operating lease agreements with varying terms 
the container for lease or lease equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life years  after the date the units are put in service  and are depreciated down to their estimated residual values 
in our opinion  estimated residual values do not cause carrying values to exceed net realizable value 
we continue to evaluate these depreciation policies as more information becomes available from other comparable sources and our own historical experience 
for the issuances of stock options  we follow the fair value provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  which we refer to as sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires recognition of employee share based compensation expense in the statements of income over the vesting period based on the fair value of the stock option at the grant date 
the pricing model we use for determining fair values of the purchase option and the embedded derivative is the black scholes pricing model 
valuations derived from this model are subject to ongoing internal and external verification and review 
the model uses market sourced inputs such as interest rates  market prices and volatilities 
selection of these inputs involves management s judgment and may impact net income 
in particular  the company uses volatility rates based upon a sample of comparable companies in royal wolf s industry and a risk free interest rate  which is the rate on u 
s 
treasury instruments  for a security with a maturity that approximates the estimated remaining expected term of the derivative 
we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and requires these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually 
we will test goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in sfas no 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
we have determined that no impairments related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets exist as of june  other intangible assets with finite useful lives consist primarily of customer lists and non compete agreements 
customer lists and non compete agreements are amortized on the straight line basis over the expected period of benefit which range from one to ten years 
costs to obtaining long term financing are deferred and amortized over the term of the related debt using the straight line method 
amortizing the deferred financing costs using the straight line method does not produce significantly different results than that of the effective interest method 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we recognize income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
for each jurisdiction  we estimate the actual amount of taxes currently payable or receivable as well as deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which these temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 

table of contents a valuation allowance is provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not that the related benefits will not be realized 
in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  we consider estimated future taxable income as well as feasible tax planning strategies in each jurisdiction 
if we determine that we will not realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets  we will increase our valuation allowance with a charge to income tax expense or offset goodwill if the deferred tax asset was acquired in a business combination 
conversely  if we determine that we will ultimately be able to realize all or a portion of the related benefits for which a valuation allowance has been provided  all or a portion of the related valuation allowance will be reduced with a credit to income tax expense except if the valuation allowance was created in conjunction with a tax asset in a business combination 
no valuation allowance has been determined to be required as of june  we have adopted fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no
