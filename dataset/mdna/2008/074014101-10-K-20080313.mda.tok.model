item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a radio broadcasting company whose primary business is acquiring  developing  and operating radio stations throughout the united states 
we own and operate radio stations in the following markets philadelphia  pa  atlanta  ga  boston  ma  miami ft 
lauderdale  fl  las vegas  nv  west palm beach boca raton  fl  ft 
myers naples  fl  wilmington  de  greenville new bern jacksonville  nc  augusta  ga and fayetteville  nc 
we refer to each group of radio stations that we own in each radio market as a market cluster 
over the past three years  we have experienced a more competitive environment in our markets and the radio broadcasting industry in general  which has resulted in slower growth in net revenue from radio stations that we have owned for more than one year 
we expect the more competitive environment to continue 
in response to the slower growth in our net revenue we have focused on improving the operations at our radio stations through investment in programming  promotions and sales while continuing to monitor costs and expenses in other areas 
recent developments we tested our fcc broadcasting licenses for impairment as of december  in accordance with the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of the testing  we recorded impairment losses of million related to the fcc broadcasting licenses in our west palm beach boca raton  fl  wilmington  de and augusta  ga market clusters 
the impairment losses were primarily due to a decrease in projected growth rates for radio advertising revenue in these markets 
for further discussion  see the critical accounting policies section elsewhere in this item 
financial statement presentation the following discussion provides a brief description of certain key items that appear in our consolidated financial statements and general factors that impact these items 
net revenue 
our net revenue is primarily derived from the sale of advertising airtime to local and national advertisers 
net revenue is gross revenue less agency commissions  generally of gross revenue 
local revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sales to advertisers in a radio station s local market either directly to the advertiser or through the advertiser s agency 
national revenue generally consists of advertising airtime sales to agencies purchasing advertising for multiple markets 
national sales are generally facilitated by our national representation firm  which serves as our agent in these transactions 
the advertising rates that we are able to charge and the number of advertisements that we can broadcast without jeopardizing listener levels generally determine our net revenue 
advertising rates are primarily based on the following factors a radio station s audience share in the demographic groups targeted by advertisers as measured principally by quarterly reports issued by the arbitron ratings company  the number of radio stations  as well as other forms of media  in the market competing for the attention of the same demographic groups  the supply of  and demand for  radio advertising time  and the size of the market 
our net revenue is affected by general economic conditions  competition and our ability to improve operations at our market clusters 
seasonal revenue fluctuations are also common in the radio broadcasting 
table of contents industry and are primarily due to variations in advertising expenditures by local and national advertisers 
our revenues are typically lowest in the first calendar quarter of the year 
a growing source of revenue comes from our radio station websites primarily through the sale of advertiser promotions and advertising on our websites and the sale of advertising airtime during audio streaming of our radio stations over the internet 
our radio station websites contributed approximately  and of net revenue during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we use trade sales agreements to reduce cash paid for operating costs and expenses by exchanging advertising airtime for goods or services  however  we endeavor to minimize trade revenue in order to maximize cash revenue from our available airtime 
the following summary table presents a comparison of our trade sales revenue and expenses 
year ended december  trade revenue trade expenses operating costs and expenses 
our operating costs and expenses consist primarily of programming  engineering  and promotional expenses  reported as cost of services  and selling  general and administrative expenses incurred at our radio stations  general and administrative expenses  including compensation and other expenses  incurred at our corporate offices  and depreciation and amortization 
we strive to control our operating expenses by centralizing certain functions at our corporate offices and consolidating certain functions in each of our market clusters 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate was approximately in  in and in  which differs from the federal statutory rate of due to the effect of state income taxes and certain of our expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been selected could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
impairment of fcc broadcasting licenses 
as of december   fcc broadcasting licenses with an aggregate carrying amount of million represented of our total assets 
we are required to estimate the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses on at least an annual basis 
we combine our fcc broadcasting licenses into single units of accounting based on our market clusters for impairment testing purposes 
we estimated the fair values of our fm licenses using discounted future cash flows and the fair values of our am licenses using a market valuation approach 
the discounted cash flow model includes certain assumptions and estimates including i the projected growth rate for radio advertising revenue in each market  ii average market share and profit margin for each class of license in each market  iii estimated capital start up capital costs  and iv the determination of an appropriate discount rate 
if we had made different assumptions or used different estimates the fair value of our fcc broadcasting licenses could have been materially different 
we recorded impairment losses of million related to the fcc broadcasting licenses in our west palm beach  fl  wilmington  de and augusta  ga market clusters in the impairment losses represented of the aggregate carrying amount of our fcc broadcasting licenses as of december  and were primarily due to 
table of contents a decrease in projected growth rates for radio advertising revenue in these markets 
there can be no assurance that additional impairments of our fcc broadcasting licenses will not occur in future periods 
impairment of goodwill 
as of december   goodwill with an aggregate carrying amount of million represented of our total assets 
we are required to estimate the fair value of our reporting units on at least an annual basis 
for the purpose of testing our goodwill for impairment  we have identified our market clusters as our reporting units 
we used internally generated estimates of future cash flows to determine the fair value of each reporting unit as of december  these estimates required management judgment and if we had made different assumptions the fair value of our reporting units could have been materially different 
there can be no assurance that impairments of our goodwill will not occur in future periods 
impairment of property and equipment 
we are required to assess the recoverability of our property and equipment whenever an event has occurred that may result in an impairment loss 
if such an event occurs  we will compare estimates of related future undiscounted cash flows to the carrying amount of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flow estimates are less than the carrying amount of the asset  we will reduce the carrying amount to the estimated fair value 
the determination of when an event has occurred and estimates of future cash flows and fair value all require management judgment 
the use of different assumptions or estimates may result in alternative assessments that could be materially different 
we did not identify any events that may have resulted in an impairment loss on our property and equipment in there can be no assurance that impairment of our property and equipment will not occur in future periods 
valuation of accounts receivable 
we continually evaluate our ability to collect our accounts receivable 
our ongoing evaluation includes review of specific accounts at our radio stations  the current financial condition of our customers and our historical write off experience 
this ongoing evaluation requires management judgment and if we had made different assumptions about these factors  the allowance for doubtful accounts could have been materially different 
recent pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we believe that the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we believe the adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas revised  business combinations which replaces sfas  business combinations 
sfas r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date 
sfas r also requires the acquirer in a business combination achieved in stages to recognize the identifiable assets and liabilities  as well at the noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  at the full amounts of their fair values 
sfas r applies to all transactions or other events in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december

loss on extinguishment of long term debt 
on april   our credit agreement was amended to  among other things  reduce the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility  extend the terms and maturities of the credit facility  and adjust the amortization schedule of the credit facility to take such extension of maturity into account 
in connection with the amended credit agreement  we recorded a million loss on extinguishment of long term debt during the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following summary table presents a comparison of our results of operations for the years ended december  and with respect to certain of our key financial measures

liquidity and capital resources overview 
our primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow and our credit facility 
our primary liquidity needs have been  and for the next twelve months and thereafter are expected to continue to be  for working capital  debt service  and other general corporate purposes  including capital expenditures and radio station acquisitions 
historically  our capital expenditures have not been significant 
in addition to property and equipment associated with radio station acquisitions  our capital expenditures have generally been  and are expected to continue to be  related to the maintenance of our studio and office space and the technological improvement  including upgrades necessary to broadcast hd radio tm  and maintenance of our broadcasting towers and equipment 
we have also purchased or constructed office and studio space in some of our markets to facilitate the consolidation of our operations 
other liquidity needs for the next twelve months and thereafter may also include additional share repurchases and cash dividends 
our credit agreement permits us to repurchase up to million of our common stock and on june   our board of directors has authorized us to repurchase up to million of our class a common stock over a one year period from the date of authorization which was extended on may  for one additional year 
on may   our board of directors authorized us to increase the remaining balance under our previous authorization from million to million and to extend the repurchase period to may  effective may   our board of directors authorized the extension of the repurchase period for one additional year 
as of february   we had repurchased million shares of our class a common stock for an aggregate million 

table of contents our credit agreement also permits us to pay cash dividends on our common stock in an amount up to an aggregate of million per year 
during the year ended december   we paid million for cash dividends 
on december   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per share on our class a and class b common stock 
the dividend of million in the aggregate was paid on january   to stockholders of record on december  our february  acquisition of the assets of wjbr fm was financed with million of borrowings under our credit facility 
our march  acquisition of the assets of kbet am was financed with cash on hand 
we expect to provide for future liquidity needs through one or a combination of the following sources of liquidity internally generated cash flow  our credit facility  additional borrowings  other than under our existing credit facility  to the extent permitted thereunder  and additional equity offerings 
we believe that we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to permit us to provide for our liquidity requirements and meet our financial obligations for the next twelve months 
however  poor financial results  unanticipated acquisition opportunities or unanticipated expenses could give rise to additional debt servicing requirements or other additional financing or liquidity requirements sooner than we expect and we may not secure financing when needed or on acceptable terms 
our ability to reduce our total leverage ratio under our credit facility by increasing operating cash flow and or decreasing long term debt will determine how much  if any  of the remaining commitments under the revolving portion of our credit facility will be available to us in the future 
poor financial results or unanticipated expenses could result in our failure to maintain or lower our total leverage ratio and we may not be permitted to make any additional borrowings under the revolving portion of our credit facility 
we anticipate making additional share repurchases and future dividend payments instead of repaying indebtedness with such funds and if we incur additional indebtedness in order to make such repurchases or dividend payments  our total debt ratio may be adversely affected and we may not be permitted to make additional borrowings under the revolving portion of our credit facility 
the following summary table presents a comparison of our capital resources for the years ended december   and with respect to certain of our key measures affecting our liquidity

the revolving credit loan includes a million sub limit for letters of credit  which may be increased to million upon our request and with the approval of the bank of montreal  chicago branch in its capacity as the letter of credit issuer 
at our election  the revolving credit loan and term loan may bear interest at either the base rate or libor plus a margin that is determined by our debt to operating cash flow ratio

table of contents as of december   we had million in remaining commitments available under the revolving portion of our credit facility  however  as of december   our maximum consolidated total debt covenant would have limited additional borrowings to million 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and guaranteed jointly and severally by all of our subsidiaries 
the guarantees were issued to our lenders for repayment of the outstanding balance of the credit facility 
if we default under the terms of the credit facility  our subsidiaries may be required to perform under their guarantees 
the maximum amount of undiscounted payments the subsidiaries would have to make in the event of default is million 
the guarantees for the revolving credit loan and term loan expire on june  as of december   the scheduled repayments of the credit facility for the next five years and thereafter are as follows revolving credit loan term loan total credit facility thereafter total we must pay a quarterly unused commitment fee equal to on the unused portion of the revolving credit loan

our consolidated operating cash flow for any four consecutive quarters must not be less than times the amount of our consolidated fixed charges for such four quarter period 
fixed charges include cash paid for interest  income taxes  capital expenditures  scheduled principal repayments  dividends  and agency and commitment fees 
failure to comply with these financial covenants  to make scheduled interest payments or scheduled principal repayments  or to comply with any other terms of our credit facility could result in the acceleration of the maturity of our debt outstanding thereunder  which could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 

table of contents as of december   we were in compliance with all applicable financial covenants under the credit facility 
as of december   as calculated pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement  our consolidated total debt ratio was times consolidated operating cash flow  our interest coverage ratio was times interest expense  and our fixed charge coverage ratio was times fixed charges 
the credit facility also contains other customary restrictive covenants 
these covenants limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness and liens  enter into certain investments or joint ventures  consolidate  merge or effect asset sales  enter sale and lease back transactions  sell or discount accounts receivable  enter into transactions with affiliates or stockholders  or change the nature of our business

beasley 
the lease agreement expires on november  rental expense was approximately  for the year ended december  the lease agreement was based on competitive bids from third parties and was reviewed by our audit committee 
we believe that this lease agreement is on terms at least as favorable to us as could have been obtained from a third party 
the following related party transactions are based on agreements entered into prior to our initial public offering in at which time we did not have an audit committee 
however  these agreements were evaluated by our board of directors at the time of entering the agreements and we believe that they are on terms at least as favorable to us as could have been obtained from a third party 
in december  we finalized the sale of most of our radio towers and related real estate assets to beasley family towers  inc bft  which is owned by george g 
beasley  bruce g 
beasley  caroline beasley  brian e 
beasley  and other family members of george g

the exact impact cannot be reasonably determined 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our credit facility 
as of december   all of our long term debt bears interest at variable rates 
accordingly  our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates 
assuming the current level of borrowings at variable rates and assuming a one percentage point increase in the current interest rate under these borrowings  we estimate that our annualized interest expense would increase by million and our net income would decrease by million 
in the event of an adverse change in interest rates  management may take actions to mitigate our exposure 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this interest rate analysis assumes no such actions 
further  the analysis does not consider the effects of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
in prior periods  we used interest rate swap agreements to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk associated with our credit facility however these interest rate swap agreements have expired 
as a result  we are now more exposed to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates
