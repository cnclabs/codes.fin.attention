the company is assessing the effects of the adoption of issue on its financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  providing companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the standard s objective is to reduce both complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
generally accepted accounting principles have required different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings 
sfas helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value  which would likely reduce the need for companies to comply with detailed rules for hedge accounting 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
the standard requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial 
table of contents statements to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
it also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which they have chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant effect on its financial position or results of operations 
in september  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
where applicable  sfas no 
simplifies and codifies related guidance within gaap and does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier adoption is encouraged 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant effect on its financial position or results of operation 
critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses for the reporting period covered thereby 
as a result  these estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information that we obtain from our customers and outside sources  and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments which impact our reported operating results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
these assumptions include but are not limited to the percentage of new products which may have chargebacks and the percentage of items which will be subject to price decreases 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note a to our financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable  adjustments for returns and price adjustments  allowance for doubtful accounts and carrying value of inventory represent significant estimates made by management 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenue is recognized for product sales upon shipment and when risk is passed to the customer and when estimates of discounts  rebates  promotional adjustments  price adjustments  returns  chargebacks  and other potential adjustments are reasonably determinable  collection is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations 
these estimates are presented in the financial statements as reductions to net revenues and accounts receivable 
estimated sales returns  allowances and discounts are provided for in determining net sales 
contract research income is recognized as work is completed and billable costs are incurred 
in certain cases  contract research income is based on attainment of designated milestones 
adjustments for returns and price adjustments our product revenues are typically subject to agreements with customers allowing chargebacks  rebates  rights of return  pricing adjustments and other allowances 
based on our agreements and contracts with our customers  we calculate adjustments for these items when we recognize revenue and we book the adjustments against accounts receivable and revenue 
chargebacks  primarily from wholesalers  are the most significant of these items 
chargebacks result from arrangements we have with end users establishing prices for products for which the end user independently selects a wholesaler from which to purchase 
a chargeback represents the difference between our invoice price to the wholesaler  which is typically stated at wholesale acquisition cost  and the end customer s contract price  which is lower 
we credit the wholesaler for purchases by end customers at the lower price 
therefore  we record these chargebacks at the time we recognize revenue in connection with our sales to wholesalers 
the reserve for chargebacks is computed in the following manner 
the company obtains wholesaler inventory data for the wholesalers which represent approximately of our chargeback activity 
this inventory is multiplied by the historical percentage of units that are charged back and by the price adjustment per unit to arrive at the chargeback accrual 
this calculation is performed by product by customer 
the calculated amount of chargebacks could be affected by other factors such as a change in retail customer mix a change in negotiated terms with retailers product sales mix at the wholesaler retail inventory levels changes in wholesale acquisition cost wac 
table of contents the company continually monitors the chargeback activity and adjusts the provisions for chargebacks when we believe that the actual chargebacks will differ from our original provisions 
consistent with industry practice  the company maintains a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period 
the company s estimate for returns is based upon its historical experience with actual returns 
while such experience has allowed for reasonable estimation in the past  history may not always be an accurate indicator of future returns 
the company continually monitors its estimates for returns and makes adjustments when it believes that actual product returns may differ from the established accruals 
included in the adjustment for sales allowances and returns is a reserve for credits taken by our customers for rebates  return authorizations and other discounts 
sales discounts are granted for prompt payment 
the reserve for sales discounts is based on invoices outstanding and assumes that of available discounts will be taken 
price adjustments  including shelf stock adjustments  are credits issued from time to time to reflect decreases in the selling prices of our products which our customer has remaining in its inventory at the time of the price reduction 
decreases in our selling prices are discretionary decisions made by us to reflect market conditions 
amounts recorded for estimated price adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers  estimated launch dates of competing products  estimated declines in market price and inventory held by the customer 
the company analyzes this on a case by case basis and makes adjustments to reserves as necessary 
the company adequately reserves for chargebacks  discounts  allowances and returns in the period in which the sales takes place 
no material amounts included in the provision for chargebacks and the provision for sales discounts recorded in the current period relate to sales made in the prior periods 
the provision for sales allowances and returns includes reserves for items sold in the current and prior periods 
the company has substantially and consistently used the same estimating methods 
we have refined the methods as new data became available 
there have been no material differences between the estimates applied and actual results 
the company determines amounts that are material to the financial statements in consideration of all relevant circumstances including quantitative and qualitative factors 
among the items considered is the impact on individual financial statement classification  operating income and footnote disclosures and the degree of precision that is attainable in estimating judgmental items 
the following table presents the roll forward of each significant estimate as of april   and and for the years then ended  respectively 
beginning balance may current provision actual credits in current period ending balance april for the year ended april  chargebacks sales discounts sales allowances returns total adjustment for returns price allowances for the year ended april  chargebacks sales discounts sales allowances returns total adjustment for returns price allowances for the year ended april  chargebacks sales discounts sales allowances returns total adjustment for returns price allowances 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we have historically provided credit terms to customers in accordance with what management views as industry norms 
financial terms  for credit approved customers  are generally on either a net or day basis  though most customers are entitled to a prompt payment discount 
management periodically and regularly reviews customer account activity in order to assess the adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts  considering factors such as economic conditions and each customer s payment history and creditworthiness 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  or if they were otherwise unable to make payments in accordance with management s expectations  we would have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories we state inventories at the lower of average cost or market  with cost being determined based upon the average method 
in evaluating the inventory  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand  estimated time required to sell existing inventory and expected market conditions  including levels of competition 
we establish reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories based upon our historical experience  product expiration dates and management s assessment of current product demand 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of april  we were not involved in any contractual obligations  unconsolidated transactions or off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s existing credit facility bears interest at a rate selected by the company equal to the prime rate or libor plus 
this facility is exposed to market rate fluctuations and may impact the interest paid on any borrowings under the credit facility 
currently  the company has no borrowings under this facility  however  an increase in interest rates would impact interest expense on future borrowings 
the company invests in us treasury notes  money market accounts and municipal securities  all of which are exposed to interest rate fluctuations 
the interest earned on these investments may vary based on fluctuations in the interest rate 
the company has invested in auction rate securities ars consisting of municipal securities that are held as investments available for sale 
after the initial issuance of these securities  the interest rate is reset periodically 
the company invests in ars that reset as to interest rate every to days and are carried at fair value 
the company has determined that auction rate securities should be classified as investments because the stated or contractual maturities are generally to years 
the securities are priced and traded as current and non current investments because of the interest reset feature 
classification of marketable securities as current or non current is dependent upon management s intended holding period  the security s maturity date and liquidity considerations based on market conditions 
if management intends to hold the securities for longer than one year as of the balance sheet date  they are classified as non current 
during the fiscal year  two of the auction rate securities failed to auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
liquidity for these auction rate securities is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals 
these ars have been classified as non current 
the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
the company hired an independent valuation company to help determine the value of the securities 
the valuation indicated that one of the securities should be valued at approximately of par value 
therefore  the company wrote down the security in the amount of  due to an other than temporary reduction in the value 
the effect of the loss on the value of the ars securities is included in other income on the statement of operations 
if the credit rating of the security issuers of ars deteriorates  the company may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an additional impairment charge
