item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion will assist you in understanding our financial position  liquidity  and results of operations 
the information below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  and the related notes to consolidated financial statements 
our discussion contains both historical and forward looking information 
we assess the risks and uncertainties about our business  long term strategy  and financial condition before we make any forward looking statements  but we cannot guarantee that our assessment is accurate or that our goals and projections can or will be met 
statements concerning results of future exploration  exploitation  development  and acquisition expenditures as well as expense and reserve levels are forward looking statements 
we make assumptions about commodity prices  drilling results  production costs  administrative expenses  and interest costs that we believe are reasonable based on currently available information 
critical estimates and accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in this report using accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements 
we must make judgments  estimates  and in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives as we apply these rules and requirements 
the most critical estimate we make is the engineering estimate of proved oil and gas reserves 
this estimate affects the application of the successful efforts method of accounting  the calculation of depreciation  depletion  and amortization of oil and gas properties and the estimate of the impairment of our oil and gas properties 
it also affects the estimated lives used to determine asset retirement obligations 
in addition  the estimates of proved oil and gas reserves are the basis for the related standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows 
estimated proved oil and gas reserves the evaluation of our oil and gas reserves is critical to management of our operations and ultimately our economic success 
decisions such as whether development of a property should proceed and what technical methods are available for development are based on an evaluation of reserves 
these oil and gas reserve quantities are also used as the basis of calculating the unit of production rates for depreciation  evaluating impairment and estimating the life of our producing oil and gas properties in our asset retirement obligations 
our proved reserves are classified as either proved developed or proved undeveloped 
proved developed reserves are those reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved undeveloped reserves include reserves expected to be recovered from new wells from undrilled proven reservoirs or from existing wells where a significant major expenditure is required for completion and production 
independent reserve engineers prepare the estimates of our oil and gas reserves presented in this report based on guidelines promulgated under gaap and in accordance with the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
the evaluation of our reserves by the independent reserve engineers involves their rigorous examination of our technical evaluation and extrapolations of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressure declines as well as other technical information and measurements 
reservoir engineers interpret these data to determine the nature of the reservoir and ultimately the quantity of proved oil and gas reserves attributable to a specific property 
our proved reserves in this report include only quantities that we expect to recover commercially using current prices  costs  existing regulatory practices and technology 
while we are reasonably certain that the proved reserves will be produced  the timing and ultimate recovery can be effected by a number of factors including completion of development projects  reservoir performance  regulatory approvals and changes in projections of long term oil and gas prices 
revisions can include upward or downward changes in the previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to evaluation of already available geologic  reservoir  or production data or new geologic or reservoir data obtained from wells 
revisions can also include changes associated with significant changes in development strategy  oil and gas prices  or production equipment facility capacity 
standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relies on these estimates of oil and gas reserves using commodity prices and costs at year end 
in our year end reserve report  we used december  conocophillips west texas intermediate posted price of per bbl and a henry hub onshore price of per mmbtu adjusted by property for energy content  quality  transportation fees  and regional price differentials 
the weighted average price over the lives of the properties was per bbl for oil and per mcf for gas 
while we believe that future operating costs can be reasonably estimated  future prices are difficult to estimate since the market prices are influenced by events beyond our control 
future global economic and political events will most likely result in significant fluctuations in future oil prices 
successful efforts method of accounting oil and gas exploration and production companies choose one of two acceptable accounting methods  successful efforts or full cost 
the most significant difference between the two methods relates to the accounting treatment of drilling costs for unsuccessful exploration wells dry holes and exploration costs 
under the successful efforts method  exploration costs and dry hole costs the primary uncertainty affecting this method are recognized as expenses when incurred and the costs of successful exploration wells are capitalized as oil and gas properties 
entities that follow the full cost method capitalize all drilling and exploration costs including dry hole costs into one pool of total oil and gas property costs 
while it is typical for companies that drill exploration wells to incur dry hole costs  our primary activities during focused on development wells and our exploratory drilling activities were immaterial 
nevertheless  we will selectively expand our exploration drilling in the future 
it is impossible to accurately predict specific dry holes 
because we can not predict the timing and the magnitude of dry holes  quarterly and annual net income can vary dramatically 
the calculation of depreciation  depletion and amortization of capitalized costs under the successful efforts method of accounting differs from the full cost method in that the successful efforts method requires us to calculate depreciation  depletion and amortization expense on individual properties rather than one pool of costs 
in addition  under the successful efforts method we assess our properties individually for impairment compared to one pool of costs under the full cost method 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties the unit of production method of depreciation  depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties under the successful efforts method of accounting is applied pursuant to the simple multiplication of units produced by the costs per unit on a field by field basis 
leasehold cost per unit is calculated by dividing the total cost by the estimated total proved oil and gas reserves associated with that field 
well cost per unit is calculated by dividing the total cost by the estimated total proved producing oil and gas reserves associated with that field 
the volumes or units produced and asset costs are known and while the proved reserves have a high probability of recoverability  they are based on estimates that are subject to some variability 
the factors which create this variability are included in the discussion of estimated proved oil and gas reserves above 
impairment of oil and gas properties we test for impairment of our properties based on estimates of proved reserves 
proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows of the affected properties to judge the recoverability of the carrying amounts 
initially this analysis is based on proved reserves 
however  when we believe that a property contains oil and gas reserves that do not meet the defined parameters of proved reserves  an appropriately risk adjusted amount of these reserves may be included in the impairment evaluation 
these reserves are subject to much greater risk of ultimate recovery 
an asset would be impaired if the undiscounted cash flows were less than its carrying value 
impairments are measured by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its fair value 
impairment analysis is performed on an ongoing basis 
in addition to using estimates of oil and gas reserve volumes in conducting impairment analysis  it is also necessary to estimate future oil and gas prices 
the impairment evaluation triggers include a significant long term decrease in current and projected prices  or reserve volumes  an accumulation of project costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected  and historical and current negative operating losses 
although we evaluate future oil and gas prices as part of the impairment analysis  we do not view short term decreases in prices  even if significant  as impairment triggering events 
exploratory drilling costs the costs of drilling an exploratory well are capitalized as uncompleted wells pending the determination of whether the well has found proved reserves 
if proved reserves are not found  these capitalized costs are charged to expense 
on the other hand  the determination that proved reserves have been found results in the continued capitalization of the well and its reclassification as a well containing proved reserves 
asset retirement obligation the company follows sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement obligations of tangible long lived assets in the period in which it is incurred 
the fair value of asset retirement obligation liabilities has been calculated using an expected present value technique 
fair value  to the extent possible  should include a market risk premium for unforeseeable circumstances 
no market risk premium was included in the company s asset retirement obligations fair value estimate since a reasonable estimate could not be made 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity increases the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  accretion of the liability is recognized each period  and the capitalized cost is amortized over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
this standard requires the company to record a liability for the fair value of the dismantlement and plugging and abandonment costs  excluding salvage values derivatives derivative financial instruments  utilized to manage or reduce commodity price risk related to dune s production  are accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities  and related interpretations and amendments 
under this statement  derivatives are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings 
if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portions of changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income or loss and are recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings 
if the derivative is not designated as a hedge  changes in the fair value are recognized in other expense 
ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are also recognized in loss on derivative liabilities 
effective january   the company discontinued  prospectively  the designation of its derivatives as cash flow hedges 
the net derivative loss related to the discontinued cash flow hedges  as of december   will continue to be reported in accumulated other comprehensive income until such time that they are charged to income or loss as the volumes underlying the cash flow hedges are realized 
beginning january   the gain or loss on derivatives will be recognized currently in earnings 
stock based compensation on january   dune adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas r replaced sfas no 
and supersedes apb opinion no 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
the pro forma disclosures previously permitted under sfas are no longer an alternative to financial statement recognition 
dune adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january  the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  reflect the impact of adopting sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective method  the consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report have additional discussion of our significant accounting policies 
business strategy dune is an independent energy company engaged in the exploration  development  acquisition and exploitation of natural gas and crude oil properties  with interests along the gulf coast and in the fairway of the barnett shale in north texas 
on may   we closed the stock purchase and sale agreement  to acquire all of the capital stock of goldking from goldking energy holdings  lp goldking was an independent energy company focused on the exploration  exploitation and development of natural gas and crude properties located onshore and in state waters along the gulf coast 
the acquisition of goldking substantially increased our proved reserves  provided significant drilling upside  and increased our geographic and geological well diversification 
additionally  the acquisition of goldking provided us with exploration opportunities within our core geographic area 
our properties now cover over  gross acres across oil and natural gas fields onshore and in state waters along the texas and louisiana gulf coast and in the fairway of the barnett shale in north texas 
we intend to focus our development and exploration efforts in our gulf coast properties and utilize low risk extensional drilling in the barnett shale 
we believe that our extensive acreage position will allow us to grow organically through low risk drilling in the near term 
we have attractive opportunities to expand our reserve base through field extensions  delineating deeper formations within existing fields and high risk high reward exploratory drilling for and beyond 
we will review and rationalize our properties on a continuous basis in order to optimize our existing asset base 
we expect to utilize our technical and operations teams knowledge of salt dome structures and multiple stacked producing zones common in the gulf coast to enhance our growth prospects and reserve potential 
we will employ technical advancements  including d seismic data  pre stack depth migration and directional drilling to identify and exploit new opportunities in our asset base 
we also plan to employ the latest drilling  completion and fracturing technology in all of our wells to enhance recoverability and accelerate cash flows associated with these wells 
we continually review opportunities to acquire producing properties  leasehold acreage and drilling prospects that are in core operating areas 
we are seeking to acquire operational control of properties that we believe have a solid proved reserves base coupled with significant exploitation and exploration potential 
we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and make acquisitions that we believe will further enhance our operations and reserves in a cost effective manner 
in summary  our strategy is to increase our oil and gas reserves and production while keeping our finding and development costs and operating costs on a per mcf equivalent mcfe basis competitive with our industry peers 
we will implement this strategy through drilling exploratory and development wells from our inventory of available prospects that we have evaluated for geologic and mechanical risk and future reserve or resource potential 
our drilling program will contain some high risk high reserve potential opportunities as well as some lower risk lower reserve potential opportunities  in order to achieve a balanced program of reserve and production growth 
success of this strategy is contingent on various risk factors  as discussed elsewhere in the k 
in addition to acquiring goldking on may   we have invested million in oil and gas properties and added bcfe through extensions  discoveries and revisions and produced bcfe 
capital costs year ended year ended year ended three years ended acquisitions proved acquisitions unproved exploration development total capex before aro aro total capex including aro proved reserves mmcfe beginning production purchases discoveries extensions revisions ending reserves reserve additions mmcfe the implementation of our strategy requires that we continually incur significant capital expenditures in order to replace current production and find and develop new oil and gas reserves 
in order to finance our capital and exploration program  we depend on cash flow from operations or bank debt and equity offerings as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital resources our main sources of liquidity and capital resources for are internally generated cash flows from operations and committed credit facilities 
during  net cash flow provided by operations increased by million to million  compared to million for  primarily because of the goldking acquisition  increased oil and gas production and higher hydrocarbon prices 
we expect our cash flow provided by operations for to increase because of higher projected production from the acquired properties  combined with oil and gas prices consistent with and steady operating  general and administrative  interest and financing costs per mcfe 
excluding the effects of significant unforeseen expenses or other income  our cash flow from operations fluctuates primarily because of variations in oil and gas production and prices  or changes in working capital accounts and actual well performance 
in addition  our oil and gas production on the gulf coast may be curtailed due to factors beyond our control 
hurricanes in the gulf of mexico may shut down our production for the duration of the storm s presence  or damage production facilities so that we cannot produce from a particular property for an extended amount of time 
in addition  downstream activities on major pipelines can also cause us to shut in production for various lengths of time 
several of these possibilities were realized in varying degrees by pipeline and other gulf hydrocarbon infrastructure disruptions occurring on the heels of hurricanes katrina and rita in our realized oil and gas prices vary significantly due to world political events  supply and demand of products  production storage levels  and weather patterns 
we sell approximately of our production at spot market prices 
accordingly  product price volatility will affect our cash flow from operations 
to mitigate price volatility and comply with the terms of our credit arrangement with our lender  we employ various hedging contracts for the remaining production in order to partially offset potential swings in hydrocarbon prices 
see additional discussion in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we incurred capital and drilling expenditures totaling million during the capital expenditures included million for the goldking acquisition  and million for exploration and development costs 
we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures over the next several years as part of our long term growth strategy 
we have budgeted million for capital and exploration expenditures in our capital and exploration budget includes million for exploration and million for development costs with the remaining million allocated to lease acquisitions  facilities and workovers 
we project that we will spend million in the gulf coast region  million on the barnett shale and the remaining million on leasehold acquisitions  facilities  and workovers 
if our exploratory and development drilling results in significant new discoveries  we will have to expend additional capital in order to finance the completion  development  and potential additional opportunities generated by our success 
the budget will be managed to stay within our cash flow from operations and committed credit facilities and consequently will be more aggressively pursued in the latter half of the year 
interest on our senior secured notes was due and payable on december  and semi annually thereafter 
the principle on the senior secured notes is not due until shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock are not redeemable until december  or upon a change in control 
dividends are payable quarterly beginning september  with the company having the option of paying any dividend on the preferred stock in shares of common stock  shares of preferred stock or cash 
effective may   we agreed with our lender to maintain our borrowing base at million under our revolver commitment with wells fargo 
as of december   we had nothing borrowed under the facility 
the lender reviews the borrowing base semi annually and  at their discretion  may decrease or propose an increase to the borrowing base relative to a redetermined estimate of proved oil and gas reserves 
subsequent to year end  we requested and received an increase in the revolver commitment to million effective february  our oil and gas properties are pledged as collateral for the line of credit and the senior secured notes 
additionally  we have agreed not to pay dividends on common stock 
the most significant restrictive financial covenant in the line of credit is an ebitda test that becomes operative if our cash plus unused credit availability under our line of credit is less than million at the end of a fiscal quarter 
this covenant has not yet been operative because our cash position at these measuring points has never fallen to the million minimum 
consequently  we are currently in compliance with the financial covenant 
if we do not comply with the covenant on a continuous basis  the lender has the right to refuse to advance additional funds under the facility and or declare any outstanding principal and interest immediately due and payable 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period total less than year years years after years in thousands contractual obligations debt and interest office lease total changes in our working capital accounts from to include an increase in our accounts receivable a decrease in our cash flow provided by operations due to higher oil and gas prices  increased production and increased balances due from our joint interest participants as a result of the goldking acquisition and increased operating activities drilling wells and facilities construction at year end 
due to the increase in operating activities  our accounts payable balance increased by million 
on december   our current assets were less than our current liabilities by million 
we believe our short term and long term liquidity augmented by sale of non core properties  if needed  is adequate to fund operations  including capital expenditures  interest and repayment of debt maturities 
results of operations comparison of and revenue revenue for the year ended increased million from the comparable period to million 
the goldking acquisition made up million of this increase 
for the year ended  oil sales volumes of mbbls accounted for million of total revenue while gas sales volumes of bcfs resulted in million 
this represented an average sales price for oil and gas of per bbl and per mcf  respectively 
in  oil and gas sales volumes were mbbls and bcf  respectively and yielded average prices of per bbl and per mcf 
the increases in volume and revenue were attributable to the goldking acquisition  higher hydrocarbon prices and increased production during the last half of the following table discloses the net oil and gas production volumes  sales  and sales prices for each of the two years ended december  and increase decrease oil production volume mbbls oil sales revenue price per bbl increase in oil sales revenue due to change in prices change in production volume total increase in oil sales revenue gas production volume mmcf gas sales revenue price per mcf increase in gas sales revenue due to change in prices change in production volume total increase in gas sales revenue operating expenses lease operating expense and production taxes total operating costs for increased million from the comparable period 
the goldking acquisition and the concomitant increase in the number of operating properties made up the vast amount of this increase 
however  this increase also includes million of workover expense on some of the goldking properties that is not anticipated to continue in future quarters 
severance taxes production taxes accounted for a per mcfe increase 
however  operating costs  not including workovers  amounted to or per mcfe increase over the following table presents the major components of our operating costs on a per mcfe basis years ending december  total per mcfe total per mcfe total per mcfe direct operating expense workovers ad valorem taxes production taxes transportation exploration expenses exploration costs for the year ended totaled million compared to million in this reduction of million is the result of the company s focus on drilling development wells in order to convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves 
accretion of asset retirement obligation accretion expense for the year increased from million in to million in representing an million increase 
this reflects the impact of the goldking acquisition which recorded million of accretion expense for the period of may  to december depletion  depreciation and amortization dd a for  the company recorded dd a expense of million compared to million for representing an increase of million 
dd a attributable to the goldking acquisition amounted to bulk of this increase 
the remaining is primarily attributable to the active drilling program in the barnett shale 
general and administrative expense g a expense g a expense for increased million from the comparable period to million 
the goldking acquisition was primarily responsible for the significant increase 
the two major components of the increase included personnel expense which increased million and stock based compensation which increased million over the twelve month period 
also included in g a expense was million of one time severance payments to former goldking employees whose employment was terminated by dune following the acquisition 
furthermore  g a also reflected million of accruals for target bonus payments for employees and officers of the company 
nevertheless  overall g a expense per mcfe declined from per mcfe to per mcfe or 
bad debt expense included in revenues receivable is a balance of million due from american energy corp 
anec 
due to the financial situation of anec  dune elected to establish a reserve for doubtful accounts in the first quarter of for the entire balance  giving rise to bad debt expense of million in the year ended loss on impairment of investment in dune purchased convertible secured debentures issued by anec in the aggregate principal amount of million for a cash price of million from transatlantic petroleum corp 
early in  the company purchased additional debentures from unrelated third parties in the aggregate principal amount of million by issuing  shares of dune s common stock at a price of or million 
as a result of the continued decline in the financial situation of anec  dune elected in the latter part of the first quarter of to establish a reserve for the entire value assigned to the anec debentures giving rise to a loss on impairment of investment of million recorded for the year ended december  other income expense interest income interest income increased million for the year ended compared to the comparable period 
these increases are attributable to interest income on large cash balances resulting from our financing arrangements of million in senior secured notes and million in convertible preferred stock that occurred on may  and june  although the majority of these funds were used to finance the goldking acquisition  cash balances at december  amounted to million 
interest expense on may   the company issued million in senior secured notes at the rate of per annum in order to finance the goldking acquisition 
additionally  on april   the company borrowed million from jefferies funding at a rate of per annum for days as interim financing 
these factors along with the amortization of the debt discount and deferred loan costs give rise to an increase in interest expense of million to million for compared to loss on derivative liabilities dune entered into derivative contracts to provide a measure of stability in the cash flows associated with the company s oil and gas production and to manage exposure to commodity prices 
prior to the goldking acquisition on may   dune s derivatives were designated as fair value hedges with the changes in the fair value of the derivatives and of the hedge items attributable to the hedged risk recognized in earnings 
subsequent to may   dune s derivatives were designated as cash flow hedges with the effective portions of changes in fair value recorded in other comprehensive income and recognized in the statement of operations when the hedged item affects earnings 
for  the company incurred a loss on embedded derivative of million compared to an immaterial loss for the loss on cash flow hedges is attributable to a decline in the fair market value of open contracts as of december  and the corresponding deferred loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
income tax benefit dune recognized a deferred tax benefit totaling million for the year ended december  versus no expense for prior years 
the benefit recognized this year is due to the deferred tax liability which was established in purchase accounting for the goldking acquisition to provide for the difference in the carry over tax basis and the new book basis and was reduced by the current year net operating loss 
in prior years the net deferred tax assets had a valuation reserve and thus were not recognized in income 
net loss available to common shareholders for the year ended  the net loss available to common shareholders decreased million to million from the comparable period 
the major components contributing to these changes include increases in stock based compensation  dd a  amortization of discount and deferred financing costs  loss on impairment of investment and interest expense as more fully detailed above 
these were substantially offset by the million deferred tax benefit and no impairment expense of oil and gas properties versus million in 
dune also paid preferred stock dividends totaling million during the year 
comparison of and a comparison of activity from to focuses on activity of the company prior to the goldking acquisition on may  the increase in operating loss from million to million is primarily attributable to the impairment of oil and gas properties of million 
absent this impairment  the company did reflect a significant increase in revenues in compared to however  operating expenses increased over during this same time period which more than offset this increase in revenue 
other income expense increased from million to million from to the significant component of this increase was interest expense 
dune borrowed over million from november  through december  in order to finance its acquisition and drilling program in the barnett shale 
consequently  the company s net loss increased from million in to million in new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb adopted accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fas fin  effective for years beginning after december  fin establishes a more likely than not threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements 
also  fin implements a process for measuring those tax positions which meet the recognition threshold  of being ultimately sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities 
there are no uncertain tax positions taken by the company on its tax returns 
the adoption of fin therefore had no material impact to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company files tax returns in the us and states in which it has operations and is subject to taxation 
tax years subsequent to remain open to examination by us federal and state tax jurisdictions 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurement 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the company is continuing to assess the potential impacts this statement might have on dune s consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is the commodity pricing available to our oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
to mitigate some of this risk  we engage periodically in certain hedging activities  including price swaps  costless collars and  occasionally  put options  in order to establish some price floor protection see note to financial statements 
we also have some exposure to market risk consisting of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our credit agreement with our senior lender 
an increase in interest rates would adversely affect our operating results and the cash flow available after debt service to fund operations 
we manage exposure to interest rate fluctuations by optimizing the use of fixed and variable debt
