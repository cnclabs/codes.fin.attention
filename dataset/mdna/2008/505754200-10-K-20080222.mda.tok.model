item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview year represented another successful one for ladish as its net sales grew by million or and net earnings grew by million or 
equally important  set the stage for future growth and improvement as the company experienced record new orders of million during the year which culminated in a year end contract backlog of million 
all of the company s business units exceeded the internal expectations for annual performance and improvements 
although reflected significant improvement on an annual basis  in typical ladish fashion  it did not occur on a smooth  linear basis throughout the year 
the company faced several challenges in the first fiscal quarter with unanticipated equipment failures 
most importantly  the world s largest counterblow hammer at the forging facility had a component failure and was out of service for most of the quarter 
the equipment challenges in the first quarter negatively impacted sales in the area of million with a corresponding effect on profitability 
the results rebounded in the second fiscal quarter as the company was able to recover from missed opportunities in the first quarter and increase quarterly sales by approximately million and net earnings by nearly million 
throughout  raw material availability and pricing presented a challenge to the company 
the issue came to the forefront in the third quarter as the company missed approximately million in sales due to the insufficient supply of one grade of high temperature alloy 
in addition  the third quarter results were also negatively impacted by the volatility of the metals by product market 
the company recycles its metal by products and utilizes the proceeds to offset cost of goods 
again  in the fourth quarter the company s net sales and profitability expanded from the prior quarter with a million increase in net sales and million growth in net earnings 
all of the key raw materials utilized by ladish were subject to significant price fluctuation in for and beyond  ladish has taken steps to assure those escalating costs are passed through to its customers 
the increase in raw material pricing does have a negative impact on cost of goods as a percentage of sales and ladish has continued to focus on productivity improvements to offset that trend 
the increasing raw material pricing combined with the sales growth has caused a growth in working capital 
as of december   inventory was million  an million increase from the beginning of the year  and accounts receivable grew million by year end ladish funded this growth with cash generated from operations and its facility 
year also was the beginning of an organic expansion of capacity throughout ladish 
the installation of a new  ton isothermal forging press at forging is underway and should be operational by mid a new melting furnace and plant expansion was announced and initiated at pct to increase investment casting capacity 
in addition  an additional titanium investment casting facility in mexico was also announced 
zkm and valley are the recipients of added machining facilities to better enable both operations to serve the aerospace industry 
in order to add this additional capacity to serve the needs of its customer base  ladish expended approximately million on capital expenditures in and expects a similar commitment in these projects have been funded to date by operating cash flow and through its facility 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales for were million in comparison to million of net sales in fiscal the year over year increase in net sales was attributable to a sales increase in jet engine components  a sales increase in aerospace components and a sales increase in industrial components

year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company recognized million of net sales in fiscal  a improvement over the million of net sales in the net sales growth was due to a sales increase in jet engine components  a sales increase in aerospace components and a sales increase in general industrial components 
the net sales increase in general industrial components was largely attributed to a full year of sales from the company s polish subsidiary  zkm 
in  cost of sales was of net sales  a decrease from the level of in this improvement resulted in a gross profit margin in of in comparison to in the increase in profitability was due to more efficient operations at the company s facilities  higher incremental earnings from absorption of fixed costs and a strong market for by product materials 
the increase in profitability was partially offset by higher raw material prices which are passed directly to the customer without mark up and the addition of the zkm sales which carry lower profit margins than sales from domestic operations

purchase obligations other long term obligations pensions postretirement benefits the company expects to fund the payment of long term debt through the use of cash on hand  cash generated from operations  the reduction of working capital and  if necessary  through access to the facility 
the purchase obligations relate primarily to take or pay raw material purchase orders necessary to fulfill the company s production backlog for the company s products along with take or pay commitments for energy supplies also necessary to fulfill the company s production backlog 
there are no net settlement provisions under any of these purchase orders nor is there any market for the underlying materials 
the company s estimated cash pension contribution is based upon the calculation of the company s independent actuary for there are no calculations beyond the company s actual cash expenditures for postretirement benefits have only been projected out through the year critical accounting policies deferred income taxes the company has domestic net operating loss nol carryforwards that were generated prior to its reorganization pre reorganization completed on april  these nols are available to the company to reduce future taxable income 
federal nol carryforwards remaining as of december  total million of pre reorganization nols 
the net realizable value of the related tax benefit of the nol is approximately million as of december  pensions the company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans plans covering a number of its employees 
the company contributed million and million  respectively  to the plans in and the company intends to contribute million  million and million to the plans in  and  respectively 
the company plans on funding those contributions from cash on hand  cash generated from operations  working capital reductions  treasury stock contributions and  if necessary  from the facility 
no calculation has been made for payments into the plans beyond the plans assets are held in a trust and are primarily invested in us government securities  investment grade corporate bonds and marketable common stocks 
the key assumptions the company considers with respect to the assets in the plans and funding the liabilities associated with the plans are the discount rate  the long term rate of return on plans assets  the projected rate of increase in compensation levels and the actuarial estimate of mortality of participants in the plans 
the most sensitive assumption is on discount rate 
for funding purposes  the company s independent actuaries assumed an annual long term rate of return on plan assets of for both and for the ten year period ending december   the company experienced an annual rate of return on plan assets of 
the company used a rate of for its discount rate assumption for  an increase from the rate used for an increase in the discount rate results in a decrease in the accumulated benefit obligation at the measurement date which may also result in a decrease in the additional minimum pension liability included as a credit to accumulated other comprehensive income 
such an increase also results in an actuarial gain which is amortized to pension expense in accordance with fasb statement no 
a decrease in the discount rate will have the opposite effect in the pension liability and pension expense 
the company bases its discount rate on long maturity aa rated corporate debt securities 
the company cannot predict whether these interest rates will increase or decrease in future years 
the company cannot predict the level of interest rates in the future and correspondingly cannot predict the future discount rate which will be applied to determine the company s projected benefit obligation 
as demonstrated in the chart below  relatively small movements in the discount rate  up or down  can have a significant impact on the company s projected benefit obligation under the plans 
projected plan benefit obligation as of december  dollars in millions at discount rate at discount rate at discount rate nor can the company predict with any certainty what the actual rate of return will be for the plans assets 
as demonstrated in the chart below  a modest change in the presumed rate of return on the plans assets will have a material impact upon the actual net periodic cost for the plans 
net periodic cost for year ending december  dollars in millions expected return expected return expected return goodwill goodwill of million  included in other assets on the company s balance sheets  represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable tangible and intangible net assets relating to business acquisitions 
it is an asset with an indefinite life and therefore is not amortized to expense 
the company s assessment of fair value takes into account a number of factors including ebitda multiples of transactions in the company s industry as well as fair market value multiples of transactions of similarly situated enterprises 
the company tests the goodwill for impairment at least annually by fair value impairment testing 
no impairments were recognized in or should goodwill become impaired in the future  the amount of impairment will be charged to sg a expense

revised  share based payment  on october  because the company has no unvested options  adoption had no material effect on its financial position or results of operations for the year ended december  or fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations requires that an entity recognize the fair value of a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
an asset retirement obligation would be reasonably estimable if a it is evident that the fair value of the obligation is embodied in the acquisition price of the asset  b an active market exists for the transfer of the obligation  or c sufficient information exists to apply an expected present value technique 
fasb interpretation no 
became effective for calendar year enterprises as of december  in applying this statement to the company  it was necessary to determine if the company will undertake any major renovation  sell  dispose or abandon its factory and factory related assets  what liability would be associated with such action  and the date such action would be taken 
the company has four factories in the united states which may be subject to certain conditional retirement obligations 
the company believes it does not have sufficient information to estimate the fair value of any asset retirement obligation because the settlement date or range of potential settlement dates has not been specified by others and information is not available to apply an expected present value technique 
there are no plans to demolish or undertake any major renovation to the factories that would result in any retirement obligations 
the factories have been and are expected to be maintained by repairs and maintenance activities that would not involve activities resulting in a retirement obligation 
furthermore  there has not been any need identified for major renovations caused by technology changes  operational changes  or other factors 
fasb statement no 
 inventory costs  an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  amends the guidance in arb no 
 chapter inventory pricing to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material 
this statement requires that those items be reflected as current period charges to expense and that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions of this statement became effective for inventory costs incurred by the company beginning january  as the company already applies this approach to inventory pricing  there was no effect on its financial position and results of operations for the years ended december  and fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  requires public companies to recognize on their balance sheet the funded status of their defined benefit  pension and postretirement plans  as of december  as of that date  the company recognized actuarial gains and losses  prior service cost  and any remaining transition amounts from the initial application of fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  as they relate to the plan s funded status 
the offset to this liability was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
the million reduction in equity does not affect the company s ability to comply with debt covenant provisions 
fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 requires that an enterprise evaluate all tax positions recognized in that enterprise s financial statements for any uncertainty that the tax positions will not be sustained under examination 
the evaluation process is twofold 
first  an enterprise must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination 
secondly  the enterprise must measure the amount of benefit to recognize in its financial statements for tax positions which meet the more likely than not threshold 
fasb interpretation no 
becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after december  therefore  this interpretation is effective for the company for the year ending december  at this time  the company does not believe there is any uncertainty with respect to the tax positions reflected in its financial statements which would result in a material change in the amount of benefit recognized in the financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company believes that its exposure to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and trade accounts receivable is immaterial
