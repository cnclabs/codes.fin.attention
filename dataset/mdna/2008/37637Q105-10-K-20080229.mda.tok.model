item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations year ended december  compared to december  the following discussion is intended to provide a more comprehensive review of the company s operating results and financial condition than can be obtained from reading the consolidated financial statements alone 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included later in this report 
highlights and overview during the past year  the company acquired north side which accounted for an increase in total assets of million  loans  net of the related alll  of million  and deposits of million 
the five subsidiaries acquired as result of the october acquisition of cdc include citizens state bank  first citizens bank of billings  first national bank of lewistown  western bank of chinook  and first citizens bank  na on january   citizens state bank  first citizens bank of billings  and first citizens bank  na were merged into first security  western  and glacier  respectively  without name change for first security  western  and glacier 
on june   western bank of chinook was merged into first national bank of lewistown and renamed first bank of montana 
the company experienced strong loan growth with total loans outstanding increasing by million  or percent from the prior year 
without the acquisition  loans increased million  or percent 
the cash flow from investments was used to fund loans 
in addition  the portfolio of north side was sold immediately after completing the acquisition with the sale proceeds used to fund higher yielding loans 
investments  including interest bearing deposits and fed funds sold  declined million  or percent  from the prior year 
non interest bearing deposits decreased million  or percent  during the year 
the company increased interest bearing deposits by million  or percent 
the acquisitions contributed million and million of the non interest bearing and interest bearing deposit growth  respectively 
fhlb advances increased million as a result of the increase in loan growth exceeding the deposit growth 
stockholders equity increased million  or percent  during the year and the company and each of the subsidiary banks have remained above the well capitalized levels required by regulators 
maintaining sufficient stockholders equity provides the company flexibility and mitigates risk during economic downturns 
the company also increased non interest income by million  primarily the result of volume increases in the loan and deposit portfolios and related fees 
looking forward  our future performance will depend on many factors including economic conditions  interest rate changes  increasing competition for deposits and quality loans  and regulatory burden 
the company s goal of its asset and liability management practices is to maintain or increase the level of net interest income within an acceptable level of interest rate risk

effect of inflation and changing prices generally accepted accounting principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without consideration for change in relative purchasing power over time due to inflation 
virtually all assets of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a company s performance than does the effect of inflation 
commitments in the normal course of business  there are various outstanding commitments to extend credit  such as letter of credits and un advanced loan commitments  and lease obligation commitments  which are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
management does not anticipate any material losses as a result of these transactions 
the company has outstanding debt maturities  the largest of which are fhlb advances 
for the maturity schedule of advances and schedule of future minimum rental payments see notes and  respectively  to the consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data

represents interest and non interest bearing checking  money market  and savings accounts market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
the company s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of the company s asset liability management process which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out the asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting the company s asset liability management related activities based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels trends 
interest rate risk the objective of interest rate risk management is to contain the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the process involves identification and management of the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates 
managing interest rate risk is not an exact science 
the interval between repricing of interest rates of assets and liabilities changes from day to day as the assets and liabilities change 
for some assets and liabilities  contractual maturity and the actual cash flows experienced are not the same 
a good example is residential mortgages that have long term contractual maturities but may be repaid well in advance of the maturity when current prevailing interest rates become lower than the contractual rate 
interest bearing deposits without a stated maturity could be withdrawn after seven days 
however  the banks experience indicates that these funding pools have a much longer duration and are not as sensitive to interest rate changes as other financial instruments 
prime based loans generally have rate changes when the federal reserve bank changes short term interest rates 
however  depending on the magnitude of the rate change and the relationship of the current rates to rate floors and rate ceilings that may be in place on the loans  the loan rate may not change 
gap analysis the following table gives a description of our gap position for various time periods 
as of december   the company had a negative gap position at six months and a negative gap position at twelve months 
the cumulative gap as a percentage of total assets for six months is a negative percent which compares to a negative percent at december  and a negative percent at december  the table also shows the gap earnings sensitivity  and earnings sensitivity ratio  along with a brief description as to how they are calculated 
the methodology used to compile this gap information is based on the company s mix of assets and liabilities and the historical experience accumulated regarding their rate sensitivity

gap earnings sensitivity is the estimated effect on earnings  after taxes of percent  of a percent increase or decrease in interest rates percent of   gap earnings sensitivity ratio is gap earnings sensitivity divided by the net earnings of  a percent increase in interest rates has this estimated percentage decrease on annual net earnings 
this table estimates the repricing maturities of the company s assets and liabilities  based upon the company s assessment of the repricing characteristics of the various instruments 
interest bearing checking and regular savings are included in the more than years category 
money market balances are included in the less than months category 
mortgage backed securities are at the anticipated principal payments based on the weighted average life 
net interest income simulation the traditional one dimensional view of gap is not sufficient to show a bank s ability to withstand interest rate changes 
because of limitations in gap modeling the asset liability management committee alco of the company uses a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income nii to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated nii sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on the company s statement of financial condition 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for nii exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given a basis point bp upward and bp downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed as a benchmark 
other non parallel rate movement scenarios are also modeled to determine the potential impact on net interest income 
the following reflects the company s nii sensitivity analysis as of december  and as compared to the percent policy limit approved by the company s and banks board of directors

the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of assets and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  the company cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates 
liquidity risk liquidity risk is the possibility that the company will not be able to fund present and future obligations 
the objective of liquidity management is to maintain cash flows adequate to meet current and future needs for credit demand  deposit withdrawals  maturing liabilities and corporate operating expenses 
core deposits  fhlb credit lines  available for sale investment securities  and net income are the key elements in meeting these objectives 
all banks are members of the fhlb of seattle 
this membership provides for established lines of credit in the form of advances that are a supplemental source of funds for lending and other general business purposes 
as of december   the company had million of borrowing capacity with the fhlb of seattle of which million was utilized 
accordingly  management of the company has a wide range of versatility in managing the liquidity and asset liability mix for each individual institution as well as the company as a whole 
capital resources and adequacy maintaining capital strength has been a long term objective 
ample capital is necessary to sustain growth  provide protection against unanticipated declines in asset values  and to safeguard the funds of depositors 
capital also is a source of funds for loan demand and enables the company to effectively manage its assets and liabilities 
shareholders equity increased million during  or percent the net result of earnings of million  common stock issued for the acquisition of north side  less cash dividend payments and an increase of thousand in the net unrealized gains on available for sale investment securities

dividend payments were increased by 
per share  or percent in the payment of dividends is subject to government regulation in that regulatory authorities may prohibit banks and bank holding companies from paying dividends that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america often requires management to use significant judgments as well as subjective and or complex measurements in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company considers its accounting policy for the allowance for loan and lease losses to be its only critical accounting policy 
the balance of the allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate of probable credit losses that have occurred in the loan and lease portfolio as of the date of the consolidated financial statements before losses have been confirmed 
the balance of the allowance for loan and lease losses is highly dependent upon management s internal risk classifications  evaluations of borrowers current and prospective performance  appraisals and other variables affecting the quality of the loan and lease portfolio 
changes in management s estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact upon the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
it is the company s policy to provide an allowance for estimated losses on loans and leases based upon past loss experience  adjusted for changes in trends and conditions of the certain items  including adverse situations that may affect specific borrowers ability to repay  current collateral values  where appropriate  delinquencies and non performing loans  amount and timing of future cash flows expected on impaired loans  criticized and classified loans  credit concentrations by credit type  industry  geography  recoveries and dispositions of balances previously charge off  volume and terms of loans  loan size and complexity  competition and bank size  local market areas and national economic conditions  effects of changes in lending policies and procedures  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and credit administration staff  and effects of legal and regulatory developments 
individually significant loans and major lending areas are reviewed periodically to determine potential problems at an early date 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is increased by charges to earnings and decreased by charge offs net of recoveries
