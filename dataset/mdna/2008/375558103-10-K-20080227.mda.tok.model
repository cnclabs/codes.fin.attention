item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to help the reader understand our results of operations and financial condition 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our audited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the financial statements and other disclosures included in this annual report on form k including the disclosures under item a 
risk factors 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles and are presented in us dollars 
executive summary this past year marked the th anniversary of the founding of gilead and the achievement of many important milestones as we continued to discover  develop and commercialize innovative therapeutics in areas of unmet medical need 
we grew our product sales significantly  we executed on several product approvals and launches in multiple territories  in licensed new compounds into our research pipeline as well as made progress on product candidates already in the clinic  integrated multiple sites that were acquired in and continued to strengthen our worldwide organization and infrastructure 
our operating results for were led by product sales of billion 
hiv product sales truvada  atripla  viread and emtriva of billion  which increased by in over  were the key driver for total product sales growth of in compared to total product sales of truvada increased by million or in when compared to the prior year  despite the availability of atripla in the united states since july atripla product sales in increased by million from together  truvada and atripla sales comprised of our total product sales in in addition to the commercial progress and success of atripla in the united states  we and our partner  bristol myers squibb company bms  expanded our atripla collaboration to include the countries that comprise the european union  as well as norway and iceland 
in december  we received approval from the european commission to market and sell atripla in these european territories 
we have already begun shipping atripla to germany  the united kingdom and austria  and expect to launch the product throughout the remainder of the european union  as pricing and other sales and marketing matters are finalized and approved 
if atripla continues to comprise a larger proportion of our total product sales  we expect our product gross margin will continue to decrease 
this decrease results from the inclusion of bms s sustiva efavirenz  which carries zero gross margin  in product sales and cost of goods for atripla 
our product gross margin decreased to due to the higher percentage of atripla in our mix of product sales as compared to hepsera product sales for increased from driven primarily by sales volume growth across most major geographical regions as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange environment 
ambisome product sales for increased from driven primarily by sales volume growth in europe as well as the impact of a favorable foreign currency exchange environment 
due to the depreciation of the us dollar against major european currencies in  foreign currency denominated product sales experienced a net benefit from the foreign currency fluctuations after considering the impact of our hedging activities 
this resulted in foreign currency having a favorable impact of approximately million on pre tax income in compared to in addition to the growth in our product sales  royalty revenues increased by in compared to of the million in royalty revenues that we recognized  million were recorded from royalties on the sales of tamiflu by f 
hoffmann la roche ltd together with hoffmann la roche inc  roche 
strong sales of tamiflu by roche  including sales of tamiflu related to worldwide pandemic planning initiatives  contributed to the increase in our royalty revenues 
despite the higher royalties recognized in  roche recently announced that they expect to see a marked decline in tamiflu sales related to pandemic planning 
we expect this decline to significantly reduce the royalties we receive from the sale of tamiflu which will adversely impact our financial results 

table of contents in june  letairis ambrisentan  a product acquired in our acquisition of myogen inc myogen  was approved by the us food and drug administration fda for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension pah 
in october  we filed a supplemental new drug application nda with the fda  as well as a type ii variation with the european medicines evaluation agency emea  for the marketing approval of viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b in adults 
additionally  in november  we submitted an nda with the fda for marketing approval of aztreonam lysine for inhalation for the treatment of pulmonary pseudomonas aeruginosa p 
aeruginosa infection in people with cystic fibrosis cf 
along with the regulatory filings made in relation to viread for hepatitis b and aztreonam lysine for inhalation for cf  we progressed the development of other compounds and drug candidates in licensed from our collaboration partners  including in the hiv area  we completed a phase clinical trial of elvitegravir gs  our novel integrase inhibitor for hiv which we licensed from japan tobacco inc in integrase inhibitors represent a new way of attacking hiv and a potential treatment alternative for patients who have developed resistance to existing classes of therapy 
pending a positive outcome of our discussions with the fda and the emea concerning the design of the phase program  we anticipate dosing patients in a phase clinical study for elvitegravir in in the hepatitis b area  we filed a supplemental nda with the fda  as well as a type ii variation with the emea  for the marketing approval of viread for the treatment of chronic hepatitis b in adults 
these applications were based on data we obtained from two key pivotal phase studies completed during the year 
we anticipate decisions from the emea and the fda in the second and third quarters of  respectively 
in the hepatitis c area  we presented preliminary data in november on our lead compound against the hepatitis c virus  gs  a non nucleoside polymerase inhibitor 
after investigating qt prolongations at certain doses  pending the fda s consent  we plan to reinitiate our phase a b study of gs to further define the efficacy and safety of the compound 
during the year  we also entered into an exclusive license agreement with lg life sciences  ltd 
lgls to develop and commercialize certain caspase inhibitors for the treatment of fibrotic diseases 
caspase inhibitors are showing potential as treatments for chronic hepatitis c and other diseases characterized by tissue scarring fibrosis 
the agreement granted us commercialization rights to lgls s investigational caspase inhibitors  including gs which is being evaluated in an ongoing phase a clinical trial as a potential treatment for chronic hepatitis c and for which we anticipate data by the end of related to this collaboration  we paid a million up front license fee that we recorded in research and development r d expenses 
in the cardiovascular area  we plan to continue to enroll our two phase clinical studies for darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension and we expect to complete enrollment in in addition  letairis for pah was approved in the united states in june  and our partner glaxosmithkline inc gsk  who has rights to ambrisentan in territories outside of the united states  received a positive opinion from the european committee for human medicinal products for the treatment of pah in february if approved  gsk will market ambrisentan under the name volibris 
in the respiratory area  we presented data from the second of the two pivotal studies of aztreonam lysine for inhalation  our inhaled antibiotic for the treatment of patients with cf who have pulmonary infection with p 
aeruginosa 
along with the nda we filed with the fda in november  we plan to submit a marketing authorization application to the emea in the second quarter of also in the respiratory area  we completed a phase a study in healthy volunteers for gs  a proprietary formulation of the combination of tobramycin and fosfomycin for inhalation  and have begun enrolling patients in two phase b clinical studies 
additionally  in august  we entered into a research collaboration and license agreement with parion sciences  inc parion to research  develop and commercialize certain epithelial sodium channel inhibitors for the treatment of pulmonary diseases 
in connection with this collaboration  we paid a million up front license fee which we recorded as r d expense and made a million investment in parion 

table of contents taken together  these programs contributed to the increase in r d expenses in as compared to  and we expect research and clinical activity in these areas will continue to increase r d expenses in in addition to our commercial and clinical efforts  we continued to expand our worldwide organization and infrastructure 
in  we integrated the sites acquired in our acquisitions of corus pharma  inc corus  myogen and raylo chemicals inc 
in september  we acquired and integrated nycomed limited  a cork  ireland based manufacturing and tableting operation 
we transferred certain of our existing dublin operations to this nycomed facility in cork and utilize this cork facility for solid dose tablet manufacturing of certain of our antiviral products and product packaging activities 
as part of our strategy to better build  manage and expand our presence in new and existing markets internationally  we established new subsidiaries in turkey  austria and switzerland in  and are in the process of establishing marketing subsidiaries in belgium  denmark  finland  the netherlands  norway and sweden 
these initiatives  which we believe will help reduce our reliance on third party distributors  have also contributed to the increase in our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in as we continue to increase headcount and expand our marketing and promotional activities in these countries 
we will continue to see an increase in sg a expenses in as we continue to expand internationally and launch products in new territories  including atripla in the european territories 
our strong operating results which contributed to operating cash flows of billion for  helped fund our r d activities  our corporate development opportunities  our worldwide infrastructure and capital requirements as well as our daily operating needs 
additionally  our strong cash position allowed us to repurchase million of our common stock in these repurchases completed the billion stock repurchase program initiated in and allowed us to initiate a billion stock repurchase program in october in addition  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement under which our credit facility was increased to billion  thereby providing greater access to funds as future requirements arise 
in  we plan to further expand our international footprint  advance additional drug candidates into the clinic and launch viread for hepatitis b and aztreonam lysine for inhalation for cf  if they are approved 
strengthening our relationships with our corporate partners continues to be a priority  especially as we and bms continue to launch atripla in the european territories 
finally  we plan to continue to strengthen our worldwide infrastructure to better support our growing employee and customer base  as well as to better facilitate our expanding manufacturing  research and development and commercial activities 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  prepaid royalties  clinical trial accruals  our tax provision and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other market specific assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition product sales we recognize revenues from product sales when there is persuasive evidence an arrangement exists  delivery to the customer has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record estimated reductions to revenues for government rebates such as medicaid reimbursements  customer incentives such as cash discounts for prompt payment  distributor fees and expected returns of expired products 
these estimates are deducted from gross product sales at the time such revenues are recognized 
of these reductions from gross product sales  government rebates significantly impact our reported net product sales and are based upon certain estimates that require complex and significant judgment of management 
government rebates we estimate amounts payable by us to government managed medicaid programs as well as to certain other qualifying federal  state and foreign government programs for the reimbursement of portions of the retail price of prescriptions filled that are covered by these programs 
government rebates that are invoiced directly to us are recorded in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
for qualified programs that can purchase our products through wholesalers at a lower contractual government price  the wholesalers charge back to us the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower price  which we record as allowances against accounts receivable 
we estimate these sales allowances based on contractual terms  historical utilization rates  any new information regarding changes in these programs regulations and guidelines that would impact the amount of the actual rebates  our expectations regarding future utilization rates for these programs and  for us product sales  the channel inventory data as obtained from our major us wholesalers in accordance with our inventory management agreements 
during  and  government rebates of million  million and million  respectively  representing  and of total gross product sales  respectively  were deducted from gross product sales 
based on the current information available to us  actual government rebates claimed for these periods have varied by less than from our estimates recorded in those periods 
as of december  and  we had accrued government rebates of million and million  respectively  in other accrued liabilities and an allowance of million and million  respectively  recorded against accounts receivable 
the following table summarizes the aggregate activity in these accrued government rebates allowance and accrued liabilities accounts balance at beginning of year charged to expense deducted from accruals balance at end of year year ended december  government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities activity related to sales activity related to sales prior to total year ended december  government rebates allowances and accrued liabilities activity related to sales activity related to sales prior to total 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on our analysis of several factors including  but not limited to  contractual payment terms  historical payment patterns of our customers and individual customer circumstances  an analysis of days sales outstanding by customer and geographic region and a review of the local economic environment and its potential impact on government funding and reimbursement practices 
if the financial condition of our customers or the economic environment in which they operate were to deteriorate  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts balance as a percentage of total accounts receivable did not materially change from december  to december  we believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions  however  significant deterioration in any of the above factors  especially with respect to the government funding and reimbursement practices in the european market could materially change these expectations and result in an increase to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories we record write downs in the value of our inventory based on our review of bad batches experienced during the manufacturing process as well as quality control reviews of our inventory 
we generally do not record inventory write downs relating to estimated obsolescence or risk of competition primarily because the shelf life of our products is long 
however  if our current assumptions about future production or inventory levels  demand or competition were to change or if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could negatively impact our product gross margins and results of operations 
prepaid royalties we capitalize royalties that we have prepaid at cost  specifically those related to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to emory university emory for the hiv indication  based on the present value of the future royalty obligation that we would expect to pay to emory assuming certain expected future levels of our product sales incorporating emtricitabine 
the present value of our future royalty obligation was derived using our weighted average cost of capital 
we review quarterly the expected future sales levels of our products and any indicators that might require a write down in the net recoverable value of our asset or a change in the estimated life of the prepaid royalty 
some potential indicators of impairment include the launch of a significant product by a competitor  significant deviations in recognized product sales compared to forecast and product safety issues and recalls 
we amortize our prepaid royalties based on an effective royalty rate that we derive from forecasted hiv product sales incorporating emtricitabine 
our product sales forecasts are prepared annually and determined using our best estimates of future activity upon considering such factors as historical and expected future patient usage or uptake of our products  the introduction of complimentary or combination therapies or products and future product launch plans 
if a previously unanticipated and significant change occurs to our sales forecasts  including the introduction of a competing product by us or one of our competitors into the same hiv market as emtricitabine  we would prospectively update the royalty rate used to amortize our prepaid royalties which may increase future royalty expense 
as of december   we had a prepaid royalty asset relating to the emtricitabine royalties we paid to emory of million 
amortization expense relating to this prepaid royalty asset was million  million and million  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
clinical trial accruals we record accruals for estimated clinical study costs 
most of our clinical studies are performed by third party contract research organizations cros 
these costs are a significant component of r d expenses 
during  and  we incurred cro costs of million  million and million  respectively 
we 
table of contents accrue costs for clinical studies performed by cros on a straight line basis over the service periods specified in the contracts and adjust our estimates  if required  based upon our on going review of the level of effort and costs actually incurred by the cro 
we validate our accruals quarterly with our vendors and perform detailed reviews of the activities related to our significant contracts 
based upon the results of these validation processes  we assess the appropriateness of our accruals and make any adjustments we deem necessary to ensure that our expenses reflect the actual effort incurred by the cros 
generally  a significant portion of the total clinical trial costs are associated with start up activities for the trial and patient enrollment 
we extensively outsource our clinical trial activities and usually perform only a small portion of the start up activities in house 
as a result  cros typically perform most of the total start up activities for our trials  including document preparation  site identification  screening and preparation  pre study visits  training and program management 
in general  these costs are typically to of the total cro contract value 
on an actual basis  this percentage range is significantly wider as many of our contracts are either expanded or reduced in scope compared to the original budget 
start up costs usually occur within a few months after the contract has been executed and are milestone or event driven in nature 
the remaining activities and related costs  such as patient monitoring and administration  generally occur ratably throughout the life of the individual contract or study 
most contracts are negotiated as fixed per unit prices and can vary in length between three months for a single dose phase study and up to two years or more for a more complex phase clinical study 
the average length of contracts in  and has been at the upper end of this range in order to provide long term safety and efficacy data to support the commercial launches of truvada  viread  atripla  emtriva  hepsera and letairis 
all of our material cro contracts are terminable by us upon written notice and we are generally only liable for actual effort expended by the cro and certain non cancelable expenses incurred at any point of termination 
amounts paid in advance relating to uncompleted services will be refunded if a contract is terminated 
some contracts may include additional termination payments that become due and payable if we terminate the contract 
such additional termination payments are only recorded if it becomes probable that a contract will be terminated 
through december   differences between actual and estimated activity levels for any particular study have not been material 
however  if management does not receive complete and accurate information from our vendors or underestimates activity levels associated with a study at a given point in time  we would have to record additional and potentially significant r d expenses in future periods 
tax provision we estimate our income tax provision  including deferred tax assets and liabilities  based on significant management judgment 
we evaluate the realization of all or a portion of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and our historical financial performance in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we expect to realize deferred tax assets for which we have previously recorded a valuation allowance  we would reduce the valuation allowance in the period in which such determination is first made 
such an adjustment was made in and when we determined that it was more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets would be realized  and therefore  we released the related valuation allowance 
this resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately million and million for and  respectively 
our future effective income tax rate may be affected by such factors as changes in tax laws  regulations or rates  changing interpretation of existing laws or regulations  the impact of accounting for stock based compensation  changes in our international organization and changes in overall levels of income before tax 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of statement of financial accounting 
table of contents standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
on january   we adopted fin and increased our liability for unrecognized tax benefits by million with a corresponding charge to the opening balance of accumulated deficit  as permitted under fin in addition  we reclassified million of unrecognized tax benefits from short term income taxes payable and noncurrent deferred tax assets to long term income taxes payable 
as of the date of adoption  we had total federal  state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of million recorded primarily in long term income taxes payable on our consolidated balance sheet  including accrued liabilities related to interest of million 
of the total unrecognized tax benefits as of january   million  if recognized  would have reduced our effective tax rate in the period of recognition 
as permitted under the provisions of fin  we will continue to classify interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations 
at december   we had total federal  state and foreign unrecognized tax benefits of million  including interest of million 
of the total unrecognized tax benefits  million  if recognized  would reduce our effective tax rate in the period of recognition 
with respect to the unrecognized tax benefits  we are currently unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
we file federal  state and foreign income tax returns in many jurisdictions in the united states and abroad 
for us federal and california income tax purposes  the statute of limitations remains open for all years from inception due to our utilization of net operating losses relating to prior years 
our income tax returns are audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we are currently under examination by the internal revenue service for the and tax years  by the franchise tax board of california for the and tax years and by various other state and foreign jurisdictions 
there are differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations  and as a result  significant disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving issues of the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions 
while we believe our positions comply with applicable laws  we periodically evaluate our exposures associated with our tax filing positions 
we record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions based upon fin we do not believe any such items currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements  although an adverse resolution of one or more of these items in any period could have a material impact on the results of operations for that period 
prior to the adoption of fin  we recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions based upon sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires that all share based payments to employees and directors  including grants of stock options  be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
on january   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method of adoption as permitted under sfas r  which requires that compensation expense be recorded for all nonvested stock options and other stock based awards as of the beginning of the first quarter of adoption 
in accordance with the modified prospective method  no prior period amounts were restated to reflect the provisions of sfas r 

table of contents prior to the adoption of sfas r  in accordance with the provisions of sfas  we elected to follow apb  and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb opinion no 
 in accounting for our employee stock based plans 
under apb  if the exercise price of our employee and director stock options was equal to or greater than the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense was recognized 
however  as required by sfas  the pro forma impact of expensing the fair value of our stock options and employee stock purchase plan was disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with our adoption of sfas r  we refined our valuation assumptions and the methodologies used to derive those assumptions  however  we elected to continue using the black scholes option valuation model 
the fair value of stock options granted prior to the adoption of sfas r was calculated using the multiple option approach while the fair value of stock options granted beginning january  was calculated using the single option approach 
concurrent with our adoption of sfas r  we determined that a blend of historical volatility along with implied volatility for traded options on our stock would be a better measure of market conditions and expected volatility 
previously  we used historical stock price volatility as it was the most reliable source of volatility data 
we estimate the weighted average expected life of our stock options based on historical cancellation and exercise data related to our stock options as well as the contractual term and vesting terms of the awards 
we record stock based compensation expense using a graded vesting expense attribution approach for nonvested stock options granted prior to the adoption of sfas r consistent with the expense attribution approach used in our historical sfas disclosures and using a straight line expense attribution approach for stock options granted after the adoption of sfas r 
we currently believe that the straight line expense attribution approach better reflects the level of service to be provided over the vesting period of our awards 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options is recognized net of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience 
as a result of the adoption of sfas r  we will only recognize a tax benefit from stock based compensation in additional paid in capital apic if an incremental tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us have been utilized 
in addition  we have elected to account for the indirect benefits of stock based compensation on the research tax credit and the extraterritorial income deduction through the consolidated statements of operations rather than through apic 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively  in operating expenses  and we capitalized million and million  respectively  into inventory 
as of december   we had unrecognized stock based compensation of million related to nonvested stock options  which we expect to expense over an estimated weighted average period of years 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented above relating to them 
results of operations total revenues we had total revenues of billion in  billion in and billion in included in total revenues were product sales  royalty revenues and contract and other revenues 

table of contents product sales product sales for the last three years consisted of the following in thousands change change hiv products truvada atripla viread emtriva total hiv products hepsera ambisome other total product sales total product sales increased by in compared to  primarily due to an increase in our total product sales volume of billion and a favorable foreign currency exchange impact of million 
total product sales increased by in compared to  primarily due to an increase in our total product sales volume of million 
a significant percentage of our product sales continued to be denominated in foreign currencies 
we used forward and option contracts to hedge a percentage of our forecasted international sales  primarily those denominated in euro 
this reduced  but did not eliminate  fluctuations in sales due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
hiv products hiv product sales in increased by compared to and by in compared to  primarily driven by product sales volume growth 
during  the average selling prices of our hiv products increased compared to  primarily driven by higher overall selling prices of our hiv products as well as the transition of some patients in the united states from coverage under medicaid to medicare part d which generally reimbursed at higher rates 
we estimated the benefit to net product sales resulting from these transitions was approximately million for truvada truvada sales increased by in compared to and by in compared to  in each case  primarily driven by strong sales volume growth in europe as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange environment in truvada sales accounted for  and of our total hiv product sales for  and  respectively 
atripla atripla sales increased by in compared to  primarily due to the first full year of atripla sales in as well as the continued strong uptake of atripla in the united states 
we consolidate of atripla product sales because we are the primary beneficiary of our joint venture with bms in the united states 
the efavirenz portion of these atripla sales was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
atripla was approved for sale in the united states in july and in the european union in december atripla sales accounted for of our total hiv product sales in sales of atripla in the european union were not significant in viread viread sales decreased by in compared to and by in compared to  in each case  primarily due to lower sales volume in the united states and europe driven by the impact of 
table of contents patients switching from a viread containing regimen to one containing truvada and or atripla in countries where truvada and or atripla is available  partially offset by sales volume increases in latin america as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange environment in the viread sales decrease in compared to was also partially offset by a favorable foreign currency exchange environment 
emtriva emtriva sales decreased by in compared to and in compared to the decreases in both years were primarily due to overall sales volume decreases driven by the impact of patients switching from an emtriva containing regimen to one containing truvada and or atripla in countries where these products are available 
hepsera hepsera sales increased by in compared to  primarily driven by sales volume growth across all major geographical regions where the product is sold  as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange environment 
hepsera sales increased by in compared to primarily driven by sales volume growth in the united states and europe 
in  hepsera sales volume also increased with respect to our sales of hepsera to gsk 
we sell hepsera to gsk at our manufacturing cost in connection with gsk s distribution activities in asia and collect a royalty from gsk upon the sale of hepsera to customers which we record as royalty revenues 
ambisome sales of ambisome increased in compared to  primarily due to sales volume growth in europe as well as a favorable foreign currency exchange impact 
sales of ambisome increased one percent in compared to  primarily due to sales volume growth in some regions  partially offset by lower pricing in most regions 
ambisome product sales in the united states relate solely to our sales of ambisome to astellas pharma inc which are recorded at our manufacturing cost 
in  we expect total product sales to continue to grow as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts 
royalty revenues the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our royalty revenues in thousands change change royalty revenues our most significant source of royalty revenues for  and was from sales of tamiflu by roche 
royalty revenues for were million  an increase of compared to  and were million for  an increase of compared to the increases in both comparative periods were primarily driven by the recognition of tamiflu royalties from roche of million and million in and  respectively 
the increases in tamiflu royalties for both comparative periods were due to the higher tamiflu sales recorded by roche  including sales related to pandemic planning initiatives worldwide 
the increase in tamiflu royalties for compared to was also due to the elimination of a contractual cost of goods adjustment resulting from the dispute resolution in november that had historically reduced the amount of tamiflu royalties recognized by us prior to november we recognize royalties on tamiflu sales by roche in the quarter following the quarter in which it is sold 

table of contents in november  we resolved our dispute with roche relating to our development and license agreement and agreed to terminate the related arbitration pending between roche and us 
related to the dispute resolution  roche paid us million 
we recognized this payment as royalty revenue in the payment consisted of million relating to disputed royalties from to  million relating to the reimbursement of the contractual cost of goods adjustment that had previously reduced our earned royalties and million relating to the updating of royalties payable to us for the first nine months of based on the then current royalty rates instead of the prior year s effective royalty rate 
roche reported in january that it expects a significant decrease in tamiflu sales in compared to  therefore  we expect our royalty revenues for to be significantly lower compared to cost of goods sold and product gross margin the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our product sales in thousands  cost of goods sold in thousands and product gross margin change change total product sales cost of goods sold product gross margin our product gross margin for was  compared to for  primarily due to product mix changes  especially as atripla  which has a lower product gross margin  comprised a larger proportion of our product sales in our product gross margin for was  compared to for the lower gross margin in compared to was primarily due to the launch of atripla in the united states  million in write downs of inventory for our gilead access program to its estimated net realizable value  as well as product mix changes as patients continued to switch from viread  a higher margin product  to truvada and or atripla 
the lower gross margin in compared to was partially offset by the lower effective royalty rate resulting from our july emtricitabine royalty buyout discussed below  lower active pharmaceutical ingredients costs and the higher average selling prices of our hiv products in the united states 
atripla product sales decreased our product gross margin  without a corresponding impact to our product gross profit 
as the primary beneficiary of our joint venture with bms in the united states  we consolidate of atripla product sales but only benefit from the product gross margin on the truvada portion of atripla 
the efavirenz portion of atripla product sales carries a zero product gross profit and gross margin since the joint venture purchases efavirenz from bms at bms s average net selling price of efavirenz in the united states 
prior to july  we paid royalties to emory on worldwide net sales of product containing emtricitabine 
in july  we and royalty pharma purchased and  respectively  of the royalty interest owned by emory in exchange for the elimination of the royalty obligation 
as a result of the purchase  we capitalized million in prepaid royalties  representing our share of the million purchase price 
in the third quarter of  we began to amortize this prepaid royalty to cost of goods sold over the remaining life of the underlying patent based on an effective royalty rate derived from our forecasted sales of products containing emtricitabine 
we record royalties to royalty pharma based on actual emtricitabine net sales relative to royalty pharma s ownership interest in the underlying emory royalty interest 
we expect our product gross margin in to be lower compared to  primarily due to a higher mix of atripla product sales  which include the efavirenz portion of atripla product sales at zero product gross profit  partially offset by product gross margin improvements driven by lower active pharmaceutical ingredients costs 

table of contents research and development expenses the following table summarizes the period over period changes in the major components of our r d expenses over the last three years in thousands change change research clinical development pharmaceutical development total research and development r d expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including salaries  benefits and stock based compensation  clinical studies performed by cros  materials and supplies  licenses and fees and overhead allocations consisting of various support and facilities related costs 
our r d activities are separated into three main categories research  clinical development and pharmaceutical development 
research costs typically consist of preclinical and toxicology costs 
clinical development costs include costs for phase   and clinical trials 
pharmaceutical development expenses consist of costs for product formulation and chemical analysis 
r d expenses in increased by million compared to  primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses of million due largely to higher headcount  increased clinical study expenses of million and increased contract service expenses of million relating to clinical  product development and research activities in our cardiovascular programs 
in addition  we paid a million up front license fee to lgls and a million license related fee to pari gmbh pari in  both of which we expensed as there was no future alternative uses for these technologies 
r d expenses in increased by million compared to  primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expenses of million due largely to higher headcount  which included stock based compensation expense of million from our adoption of sfas r on january   as well as increased contract service and clinical study expenses of million relating to clinical  product development and research activities in our hiv and hepatitis programs and the respiratory and cardiovascular programs assumed in our acquisitions of myogen and corus 
these higher expenses were partially offset by lower milestone payments made to japan tobacco  inc japan tobacco in compared to related to the licensing and development of elvitegravir  our lead integrase inhibitor candidate also known as gs  as well as a million payment to emory in in connection with the amendment of our license agreement with emory related to our obligation to develop emtricitabine for the hepatitis b indication 
in general  significant collaboration payments  like those made to lgls  pari  japan tobacco and emory  can cause our r d expenses to fluctuate period over period 
in  we expect r d expenses to increase over levels due to increased spending on our internal and collaborative r d efforts relating to the progress of our product candidates into more advanced clinical studies as well as continuation of our clinical trials related to elvitegravir for hiv  darusentan for resistant hypertension and viread for hbv  and the initiation of the phase program for letairis

table of contents sg a expenses for increased by million compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expenses of million due largely to higher headcount  as well as an increase in marketing and promotional expenses of million in the antiviral and cardiovascular areas  including those related to our launch of letairis for the treatment of pah 
sg a expenses for increased by million compared to higher expenses were primarily driven by higher headcount which increased compensation and benefits by million  including stock based compensation expense of million from our adoption of sfas r on january   increased expenses of million in contract services and promotional programs relating to our business growth  business development activities  preparation for the launch of atripla in the united states and a million write off of certain capital assets related to renovations at our corporate headquarter campus 
in  we expect sg a expenses to increase primarily due to higher costs to be incurred on administrative activities and sales and marketing efforts to support our business growth  as well as costs associated with anticipated launches of atripla in the european union  viread for hbv in both the united states and european union  and aztreonam lysine for inhalation for cf in the united states 
purchased in process research and development expenses in connection with our acquisitions of myogen and corus in  we recorded purchased in process research and development ipr d expenses of billion and million  respectively  for the year ended december  the purchased ipr d expense for myogen represented the estimated fair value of myogen s incomplete r d programs that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date and  therefore  was expensed upon acquisition 
a summary of these programs at the acquisition date  updated for subsequent changes in status of development  is as follows program description status of development estimated acquisition date fair value in millions ambrisentan an orally active  non sulfonamide  propanoic acid class  endothelin receptor antagonist era for the treatment of pah 
phase clinical trials were completed prior to the acquisition date 
we filed an nda with the fda in december and  in june  the fda approved letairis ambrisentan for the treatment of pah in the united states 
additionally  in march  the emea validated the marketing authorization application for ambrisentan for the treatment of pah  filed by our collaboration partner  gsk 
in february  ambrisentan received a positive opinion from the european committee for human medicinal products for the treatment of pah and will be marketed under the name volibris by gsk upon approval 
 darusentan an orally active eta selective era for the treatment of resistant hypertension 
in phase clinical development as of the acquisition date and the date of this filing 

table of contents the estimated fair value of the purchased ipr d was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
we estimated the fair value of the purchased ipr d using a present value discount rate of  which is based on the estimated internal rate of return for myogen s operations  is comparable to the estimated weighted average cost of capital for companies with myogen s profile  and represents the rate that market participants would use to value the purchased ipr d 
we compensated for the differing phases of development of ambrisentan and darusentan by probability adjusting our estimation of the expected future cash flows associated with each program 
we then determined at that time the present value of the expected future cash flows using the discount rate of 
the projected cash flows from the ambrisentan and darusentan programs were based on key assumptions such as estimates of revenues and operating profits related to the programs considering their stages of development  the time and resources needed to complete the development and approval of the related product candidates  the life of the potential commercialized products and associated risks  including the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in developing a drug compound such as obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and risks related to the viability of and potential alternative treatments in any future target markets 
for the purpose of estimating the fair value of the ambrisentan program  we estimated that the program was approximately complete as of the acquisition date  based on estimated time and cost to complete  as phase clinical trials had been completed 
as of the acquisition date  we estimated that we would incur future r d costs of approximately million to million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization was expected to occur 
material net cash inflows were estimated to begin in for ambrisentan  assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date 
for the purpose of estimating the fair value of the darusentan program  we estimated that the program was approximately complete as of the acquisition date  based on estimated time and cost to complete  and remaining efforts would include the completion of phase clinical development as well as preparing for and filing an nda with the fda 
as of the acquisition date  we estimated that we would incur future r d costs of approximately million to million from the date of acquisition through and including the year when commercialization was expected to occur 
material net cash inflows were estimated to begin in for darusentan  assuming the necessary regulatory approvals would be received and the product would be successfully commercialized by that date 
the remaining efforts for completing the darusentan ipr d program primarily consist of clinical trials  the cost  length and success of which are extremely difficult to predict  and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals 
numerous risks and uncertainties exist that could prevent completion of development  including the ability to enroll patients in clinical trials  the possibility of unfavorable results of our clinical trials and the risk of failing to obtain fda and other regulatory body approvals 
feedback from regulatory authorities or results from clinical trials might require modifications to or delays in later stage clinical trials or additional trials to be performed 
we cannot be certain that darusentan for the treatment of resistant hypertension will be approved in the united states or in countries outside of the united states or whether marketing approvals will have significant limitations on its use 
future discussions with regulatory agencies will determine the amount of data needed and timelines for review  which may differ materially from current projections 
darusentan may never be successfully commercialized 
as a result  we may make a strategic decision to discontinue development of darusentan if  for example  we believe commercialization will be difficult relative to other opportunities in our pipeline 
if this program cannot be completed on a timely basis or at all  then our prospects for future revenue growth may be adversely impacted 
no assurance can be given that the underlying assumptions used to forecast the above cash flows or the timely and successful completion of this project will materialize as estimated 
for these reasons  among others  actual results may vary significantly from estimated results

corus s two other early stage candidates were not included in the valuation of purchased ipr d because they were early stage projects that did not have identifiable revenues and expenses associated with them 
for the purpose of estimating the fair value of the aztreonam program  we estimated that the program was approximately complete as of the acquisition date  based on estimated time and cost to complete  and remaining efforts would include the completion of phase clinical development as well as preparing for and filing an nda with the fda

table of contents other information in december  we  along with our wholly owned subsidiary  gilead biopharmaceutics ireland corporation gbic  entered into an amended and restated credit agreement  which superseded the existing revolving credit agreement  with a syndicate of banks to increase the credit facility to billion 
the amended and restated credit agreement also includes a sub facility for swing line loans and letters of credit 
under the terms of the amended and restated credit agreement  we may borrow initially up to an aggregate of billion in revolving credit loans 
loans under the amended and restated credit agreement bear interest at either i libor plus a margin ranging from basis points to basis points or ii the base rate  as defined in the amended and restated credit agreement 
we can prepay any outstanding borrowings at any time in whole or in part without penalty or premium  and any outstanding interest or principal would be due and payable in december in connection with the amended and restated credit agreement  we entered into a parent guaranty agreement under which we guaranteed the obligations of gbic under the amended and restated credit agreement 
we expect to use the proceeds of any loans under the amended and restated credit agreement for working capital requirements and general corporate purposes 
as of december   we had a million letter of credit outstanding under the amended and restated credit agreement 
in august  as a result of a review of the terms under our existing corporate aircraft leases and upon consideration of the various alternatives available to us upon their expiration  we entered into agreements to purchase three aircraft to be constructed for delivery in and the aggregate purchase price under the purchase agreements was million 
as of december   we had made deposits totaling million which has been recorded in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheet 
future deposits due under the terms of the purchase agreements are as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in we have the option to terminate the purchase agreements  subject to a maximum payment of of the fully equipped price of the aircraft 
we believe that our existing capital resources  supplemented by cash generated from our operations  will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the foreseeable future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the following the commercial performance of our current and future products  the progress and scope of our r d efforts  including preclinical studies and clinical trials  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the expansion of our sales and marketing capabilities  administrative expenses  the possibility of acquiring additional manufacturing capabilities or office facilities  the possibility of acquiring other companies or new products  the establishment of additional collaborative relationships with other companies  and costs associated with the defense  settlement and adverse results of litigation and government investigations 
we may in the future require additional funding  which could be in the form of proceeds from equity or debt financings 
if such funding is required  we cannot assure that it will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently material or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents contractual obligations our contractual obligations consist of debt obligations  capital and operating leases  as well as purchase obligations primarily in the form of capital commitments  purchase obligations for active pharmaceutical ingredients and inventory related items and clinical trials contracts 
the following table summarizes our significant enforceable and legally binding obligations  future commitments and obligations related to all contracts that we are likely to continue regardless of the fact that they are cancelable as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than years convertible senior notes capital lease obligations operating lease obligations capital commitments purchase obligations clinical trials total at december   we had outstanding principal of billion on the notes that we issued in april at december   we had firm capital project commitments of approximately million primarily relating to the expansion of certain aspects of our manufacturing capabilities and the upgrading of our facilities 
at december   we had firm purchase commitments related to active pharmaceutical ingredients and certain inventory related activities 
the amounts related to active pharmaceutical ingredients only represent minimum purchase requirements 
actual purchases are expected to significantly exceed these amounts 
at december   we had several clinical studies in various clinical trial phases 
our most significant clinical trial expenditures are to cros 
although most of our contracts with cros are cancelable  we generally have not cancelled such contracts 
these amounts reflect commitments based on existing contracts and do not reflect any future modifications to  or termination of  existing contracts and anticipated or potential new contracts 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and have not been included in the table above 
with respect to our total gross unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of million as of december   we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
such amounts were included in long term income taxes payable on our consolidated balance sheet  and have not been included in the table above 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for recognizing and measuring assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree in a business combination 
sfas r also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in a business combination  and requires the acquirer to disclose information it needs to evaluate and understand the financial effect of the business combination 
as sfas r is effective for business combination transactions for which the acquisition date is on or after december   we do not know whether sfas r will have a material impact to our prospective consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income loss attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
sfas also establishes reporting requirements that identify and distinguish between the interest of the parent and the interest of the noncontrolling owners 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our operations include manufacturing and sales activities in the united states  canada and ireland as well as sales activities in countries outside the united states  including europe and australia 
as a result  our financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we distribute our products 
our operating results are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  the most significant of which are the euro  the british pound and the australian dollar 
when the us dollar strengthens against these currencies  the relative value of sales made in the respective foreign currency decreases 
conversely  when the us dollar weakens against these currencies  the relative amounts of such sales increase 
overall  we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and  therefore  benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
a significant percentage of our product sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts and foreign exchange option contracts to partially mitigate the impact of changes in currency exchange rates on cash flows from our sales denominated in foreign currencies 
we also hedge a portion of our accounts receivable balances denominated in foreign currencies  which reduces but does not eliminate our exposure to currency fluctuations between the date a sale is recorded and the date that cash is collected 
in general  the market risks of these contracts are offset by corresponding gains and losses on the transactions being hedged 
in recent years  foreign currency exchange fluctuations have primarily had a positive impact to product sales and gross margin  however  the full impact of the foreign currency fluctuations have been moderated by our hedge program 

table of contents the following table summarizes the notional amounts  average currency exchange rates and fair values of our open foreign exchange forward and option contracts at december  all contracts have maturities of months or less 
average rates are stated in terms of the amount of us dollars per foreign currency 
fair values represent estimated settlement amounts at december  notional amounts and fair values in us dollars in thousands foreign exchange forward contracts currency notional amount weighted average settlement price fair value british pound euro australian dollar total foreign exchange option contracts currency notional amount weighted average strike price fair value british pound euro australian dollar total total foreign exchange forward and option contracts the total notional amount of billion and total fair value relating to our liabilities of million on our open foreign exchange forward and option contracts at december  compares with a total notional amount of billion and a total fair value relating to our liabilities of million on our open foreign exchange forward contracts at december  interest rate risk our portfolio of available for sale marketable securities and our fixed and variable rate liabilities create an exposure to interest rate risk 
with respect to our investment portfolio  we adhere to an investment policy that requires us to limit amounts invested in securities based on duration  industry group and investment type and issuer  except for securities issued by the us government 
the goals of our investment policy  in order of priority  are as follows safety and preservation of principal and diversification of risk  liquidity of investments sufficient to meet cash flow requirements  and competitive after tax rate of return 

table of contents the following table summarizes the expected maturities and average interest rates of our interest generating assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  dollars in thousands years ending december  total fair value at december  thereafter assets available for sale debt securities average interest rate liabilities convertible senior notes average interest rate capital lease obligations  including current portion average interest rate in april  we issued million principal amount of convertible senior notes due notes and million principal amount of convertible senior notes due notes in a private placement pursuant to rule a of the securities act of  as amended 
the notes and notes were issued at par and bear interest rates of and  respectively  and may be converted subject to certain circumstances 
credit risk in february  we began observing the failed auctions for auction rate securities whose underlying assets are comprised of student loans 
as of december   we held approximately million of auction rate securities within our available for sale long term marketable securities of which million were securities whose underlying assets were comprised of student loans 
our auction rate securities comprised approximately of our total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as of december  most of our auction rate securities  including those subject to the failed auctions  are currently rated aaa  consistent with the high quality rating required by our investment policy 
we believe that given our cash and marketable securities position  our expected operating cash flows as well as access to funds through our credit facility  we are able to hold the securities until there is a recovery in the auction market and the related securities  which may be at final maturity 
our accounts receivable balance at december  was million  compared to million at december  the growth in our accounts receivable balances was primarily due to higher product sales of our hiv products in the united states and europe 
in certain countries where payments are typically slow  primarily greece  italy  portugal and spain  our aggregated accounts receivable balance was significant 
in most cases  these slow payment practices reflect the pace at which governmental entities reimburse our customers 
this  in turn  may increase the credit risk related to certain of our customers 
sales to customers in countries that tend to be relatively slow paying have in the past increased  and in the future may further increase  the average length of time that accounts receivable are outstanding 
at december   our past due accounts receivable for greece  italy  portugal and spain totaled million  of which million was more than days past due 
to date  we have not experienced significant losses with respect to the collection of our accounts receivable  and we believe that substantially all of our accounts receivable balances are collectible 
we perform credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally have not required collateral
