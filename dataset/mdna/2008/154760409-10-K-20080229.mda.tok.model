item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a bank holding company that  through our banking subsidiary  central pacific bank  offers full service commercial banking in the state of hawaii 
in addition  we have four loan production offices serving customers in california 
in  we decided to exit the market in the state of washington in order to refocus our efforts in the hawaii and california markets 
our products and services focus on two areas loans we focus our lending activities on commercial  commercial mortgage and construction loans to small and medium sized companies  business professionals and real estate developers 
our lending activities contribute to a key component of our revenues interest income 
deposits we strive to provide exceptional customer service and products that meet our customers needs  like our exceptional account and totally free checking and maintenance of a broad branch and atm network in the state of hawaii 
raising funds through our deposit accounts enables us to support our lending activities 
the interest paid on such deposits has a significant impact on our interest expense  an important factor in determining our earnings 
in addition  fees and service charges on deposit accounts contribute to our revenues 
additionally  we offer wealth management products and services such as non deposit investment products  annuities  insurance  investment management  asset custody and general consultation and planning services 
in this discussion  we have included statements that may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are not historical facts but instead represent only our beliefs regarding future events  many of which  by their nature  are inherently uncertain and beyond our control 
these statements relate to our future plans and objectives  among other things 
by identifying these statements for you in this manner  we are alerting you to the possibility that our actual results may differ  possibly materially  from the results indicated in the forward looking statements 
important factors that could  among others  cause our results to differ  possibly materially  from those indicated in the forward looking statements are discussed above under business factors that may affect our business in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
executive overview our operating results during the first half of were generally favorable due to a combination of factors including sequential loan and deposit growth  strong asset quality and our ability to control expenses 
however  during the second half of  our operating results were negatively impacted primarily by the rapid decline in the california residential construction market as the weakening of the us housing sector became worse than most observers expected 
despite the deterioration of the california housing and construction markets during the second half of  we were able to increase total loans and leases excluding loans held for sale by over the prior year  grow total assets by over the prior year  increase total deposits by over the prior year  increase total interest income by over the prior year  and enhance our risk monitoring systems and compliance processes to a sufficient level that enabled us to successfully lift the previously agreed upon order in november we began with the primary focus of expanding and solidifying deposit relationships in support of strong loan demand and mitigating the impact of competitive factors and interest rate driven shifts in deposit composition 
although asset quality also remained strong through the first half of with a net loan charge off ratio of and a nonperforming assets to loans ratio of  during the second half of our focus quickly shifted to managing credit risk as we experienced a deterioration in our california residential construction loan portfolio 
home sales activity in california began to drop off dramatically starting in august  largely due to the tightening of lending standards resulting from the nationwide increase in subprime mortgage defaults and foreclosures 
this drop off  combined with overcapacity in the california real estate market  resulted in the suspension of many projects and made it increasingly difficult to move existing inventory 
these factors in turn caused a noticeable slowing of absorption rates and certain of our borrowers in the california residential construction market found it increasingly difficult to repay amounts due on their outstanding balances 
as a result  we experienced a significant increase in credit costs during the second half of for further discussion of these trends and other factors affecting our business  see overview of results of operations 
business environment the majority of our operations are concentrated in the states of hawaii and california 
accordingly  our business performance is directly affected by conditions in the banking industry  macro economic conditions and the real estate market in those states 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by expanding gross state product  low unemployment and rising personal income 
general economic conditions in hawaii continued to moderate in after exceptional growth in and and moderate growth in tourism remains hawaii s most significant economic driver  and according to the hawaii department of business economic development tourism dbedt  million visitors visited the state in this was a slight decrease of from the number of visitor arrivals in however  increased daily visitor spending boosted total visitor spending to a record billion  an increase of over the department of labor and industrial relations reported that hawaii s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was in december  compared to in december despite the increase  hawaii s unemployment rate remained well below the national seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 
the dbedt projects real personal income growth to approximate in  and remain relatively unchanged through the dbedt also projects real gross state product growth of in with real estate lending as a primary focus  including construction loans  residential mortgages and commercial mortgages  we are also dependent on the strength of the real estate market 
following several years of strong growth in and  the hawaii real estate market further cooled in as it did in according to the honolulu board of realtors  for the full year  oahu unit sales volume dropped for single family homes and dropped for condominiums 
despite the decrease in unit sales volumes  median sales prices in for single family homes and condominiums on oahu were  and  respectively  representing increases of and  respectively  over median prices 
expectations are for the hawaii real estate market to continue to moderate with slight declines in unit sales volumes and sales prices likely in the economy in california began to cool in the second half of  primarily caused by the slowdown in the real estate market 
the residential real estate market in california began to show clear signs of weakness and began rapidly deteriorating in august the central valley and inland empire areas of california have been particularly hard hit and foreclosure rates continue to rise in those areas 
the decline of the real estate market generally has been significantly worsened by recent events in the sub prime and non prime loan markets 
the california association of realtors car reported that december unit home sales declined  while the median price fell from year ago levels 
car forecasts continued declines in home prices and unit sales in as decreased affordability and the impact of tighter credit underwriting standards amid rising default rates in sub prime and non prime mortgages are expected to continue to impact housing growth 
according to the california department of finance cdof  average personal income increased by in from one year ago and projections for call for an increase of from the cdof also reported that california civilian workforce grew by to million in december from million a year ago  while california s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in december increased to from in the prior year 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that management make certain judgments and use certain estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosures made 
accounting estimates are deemed critical when a different estimate could have reasonably been used or where changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period and would materially impact our consolidated financial statements as of or for the periods presented 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates noted below with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the accompanying disclosures 
allowance for loan and lease losses we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance at an amount we expect to be sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio based on a projection of probable net loan charge offs 
for loans classified as impaired  an estimated impairment loss is calculated 
to estimate loan charge offs on other loans  we evaluate the level and trend of nonperforming and potential problem loans and historical loss experience 
we also consider other relevant economic conditions and borrower specific risk characteristics  including current repayment patterns of our borrowers  the fair value of collateral securing specific loans  changes in our lending and underwriting standards and general economic factors  nationally and in the markets we serve  including the real estate market generally and the residential construction market 
estimated loss rates are determined by loan category and risk profile  and an overall required allowance is calculated 
based on our estimate of the level of allowance required  a provision for loan and lease losses the provision is recorded to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level 
we adjusted our provision in the third and fourth quarters of in accordance with our risk assessment policies to account for an increase in exposure which was primarily caused by changes in the california residential construction market 
reserves for unfunded commitments are recorded separately through a valuation allowance included in other liabilities 
credit losses for off balance sheet credit exposures are deducted from the allowance for credit losses on off balance sheet credit exposures in the period in which the liability is settled 
the allowance for credit losses on off balance sheet credit losses is established by a charge to other operating expense 
since we cannot predict with certainty the amount of loan and lease charge offs that will be incurred and because the eventual level of loan and lease charge offs are impacted by numerous conditions beyond our control  a range of loss estimates could reasonably have been used to determine the allowance and provision 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review our allowance 
such agencies may require that we recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
accordingly  actual results could differ from those estimates 
deterioration in the hawaii real estate market or continued deterioration in the california real estate market could result in an increase in loan delinquencies  additional increases in our allowance and provision  as well as an increase in loan charge offs 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we review the carrying amount of goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
additionally  we perform an impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets may not be recoverable 
significant negative industry or economic trends  disruptions to our business  unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets  divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill 
our impairment assessment of goodwill and other intangible assets involves the estimation of future cash flows and the fair value of reporting units to which goodwill is allocated 
estimating future cash flows and determining fair values of the reporting units is judgmental and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of the impairment charge 
in the fourth quarter of  we experienced a significant decline in our market capitalization and we determined that this decline was an indicator that an impairment test was required under sfas as a result of our impairment test  we determined that the goodwill associated with our commercial real estate reporting segment  which includes the california residential construction loan portfolio  was impaired and we consequently recorded a non cash charge of million in the fourth quarter of deferred tax assets and tax contingencies we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
a valuation allowance may be required if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary  we consider the level of taxable income in prior years  to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws  as well as estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies that could be implemented to accelerate taxable income if necessary 
if our estimates of future taxable income were materially overstated or if our assumptions regarding the tax consequences of tax planning strategies were inaccurate  some or all of our deferred tax assets may not be realized  which would result in a charge to earnings 
we have established income tax contingency reserves for potential tax liabilities related to uncertain tax positions 
tax benefits are recognized when we determine that it is more likely than not that such benefits will be realized 
where uncertainty exists due to the complexity of income tax statutes and where the potential tax amounts are significant  we generally seek independent tax opinions to support our positions 
if our evaluation of the likelihood of the realization of benefits is inaccurate  we could incur additional income tax and interest expense that would adversely impact earnings  or we could receive tax benefits greater than anticipated which would positively impact earnings 
defined benefit retirement plan defined benefit plan obligations and related assets of our defined benefit retirement plan are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  the defined benefit retirement plan was curtailed and all plan benefits were fixed as of that date 
plan assets  which consist primarily of marketable equity and debt securities  are typically valued using market quotations 
plan obligations and the annual pension expense are determined by independent actuaries through the use of a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in measuring the plan obligations include the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize a yield that reflects the top of the universe of bonds  ranked in the order of the highest yield 
asset returns are based upon the anticipated average rate of earnings expected on the invested funds of the plans 
at december   we used a weighted average discount rate of and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of  which affected the amount of pension liability recorded as of year end and the amount of pension expense to be recorded in at december   a weighted average discount rate of and an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of were used in determining the pension liability recorded as of year end and the amount of pension expense recorded in for both the discount rate and the asset return rate  a range of estimates could reasonably have been used which would affect the amount of pension expense and pension liability recorded 
an increase in the discount rate or asset return rate would reduce pension expense in  while a decrease in the discount rate or asset return rate would have the opposite effect 
a change in the discount rate assumption would impact pension expense by million and year end pension liability by million  while a change in the asset return rate would impact pension expense by million

net interest income expressed on a taxable equivalent basis  totaled million in  increasing by million  or  over net interest income of million in  which increased by million  or  over net interest income of million recognized in the increase in net interest income in was driven in large part by the increase in average interest earning assets  offset by increases in funding costs as average rates increased during the period

interest income expressed on a taxable equivalent basis of million in increased by million  or  over the million earned in  which increased by million  or  from million in as depicted in table  the increase in interest income in is due primarily to the increase in average loan and lease balances  and to a lesser extent  the increase in average yields thereon 
average interest earning assets of billion in increased by million  or  over due largely to an increase of million  or  in average loans and leases as loan demand remained relatively strong through most of the average yield on interest earning assets of in increased by basis points over the average yield of  with loan and lease yields increasing by only basis points as variable rate loans began to reprice downward in mid comparing results to those of  the increase in interest income can be attributed to the million  or  increase in average loans and leases combined with the basis point increase in average yield over loan and lease growth in was reflective of strong demand in our construction and residential lending portfolios 
average yields on loans and leases increased by basis points in  reflective of the general level of market interest rates at that time 
interest expense interest expense expressed on a taxable equivalent basis of million in increased by million  or  compared to million in  which increased by million  or  compared to million in in  average interest bearing liabilities increased by million  or  to billion  including increases of million in average interest bearing deposits and million in average long term debt  while average short term borrowings decrease by million 
the average rate on interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points due primarily to a basis point increase in rates paid on interest bearing deposits 
competitive pricing in the hawaii market  coupled with the migration in customer accounts from demand and savings and money market accounts to time deposits  resulted in the higher funding costs in in  increases in average interest bearing liabilities and the average rates paid thereon were the drivers of the increase in interest expense 
average interest bearing liabilities of billion increased by million  or  including increases of million in average interest bearing deposits and million in average long term debt 
the average rate on interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points due primarily to a basis point increase in rates paid on interest bearing deposits 
competitive pricing in the hawaii market  coupled with promotional rates offered in connection with our exceptional account campaigns  resulted in the higher funding costs in  particularly for savings and money market deposits and time deposits of  and over 
net interest margin our net interest margin was  and in  and  respectively 
the decline in net interest margin in both and can be attributed to the differences in timing of rate movements in our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in both and  increases in average yields on interest earning assets fell short of increases in average rates on interest bearing liabilities 
this mismatched timing of rate movements resulted from delayed deposit repricings in the hawaii market 
based on our expectations for stabilized to slightly declining loan levels and interest rate movements in  we anticipate declines in asset yields and moderate decreases in deposit rates 
accordingly  we anticipate further compression of our net interest margin for the coming year 
our ability to generate continued growth in loans  which typically bring higher yields than other interest earning assets  our ability to fund that asset growth with relatively low cost core deposits and competitive pricing factors will directly impact our anticipated future net interest margins and net interest income

the decrease in salaries and employee benefits can be attributed to a reduction in certain bonus and incentive compensation accruals  as well as the recognition of million in executive retirement expenses in the decrease in salaries and employee benefits was partially offset by the an increase in other expenses of million  or  as we increased our reserve for unfunded commitments by approximately million in to cover credit risks primarily associated with our california residential construction loan portfolio 
salaries and employee benefits of million in increased by million  or  over primary drivers for the increase in salaries and employee benefits include the recognition of million in stock option expense as a result of the implementation of sfas r and the recognition of the aforementioned executive retirement expenses totaling million 
amortization of core deposit premium totaled million in  compared to million in the decrease in amortization expense from to was reflective of a third party valuation of the core deposit premium that was finalized in and resulted in a revision of the amortization period from years to years

loan portfolio we focus our lending activities on commercial  commercial mortgage and construction loans to small and middle market companies  business professionals and real estate developers 
our strategy for generating new loans relies upon teams of highly qualified commercial real estate and commercial banking officers organized by geographical and industry lines who are responsible for client prospecting and business development 
we have established four loan production offices in california staffed by experienced lenders with established client relationships 
to manage credit risk ie  the inability of borrowers to repay their loan obligations  management analyzes the borrower s financial condition  repayment source  collateral and other factors that could impact credit quality  such as national and local economic conditions and industry conditions related to respective borrowers 
loans and leases totaled billion at december   increasing by million  or  over the billion at year end  which increased by million  or  over the billion held at year end despite the slowdown in the last half of  we experienced overall growth in most of our various loan portfolios  led by a increase in residential mortgage lending  a increase in construction lending  a increase in consumer lending and a increase in commercial real estate mortgages 
these increases were partially offset by a slowdown in our commercial  financial and agricultural lending  which decreased by from levels 
during  approximately million  or  of total loan growth was derived from our hawaii lending activities  while approximately million  or  of total loan growth was generated in california and the remaining million in loan growth  or  from washington 
while new loans have grown over the past year  we note that much of that growth occurred in california and we have significantly increased our provision for loan and lease losses during that same time period as a result of concerns regarding the quality of our loan portfolio in the california market 
it is unlikely  given the current market conditions  that this loan growth will continue in the near future

the borrower s business is typically regarded as the principal source of repayment  although our underwriting policy and practice generally requires additional sources of collateral  including real estate and other business assets  as well as personal guarantees where possible to mitigate risk 
risks of credit losses are greater in this loan category relative to secured loans  such as commercial and residential mortgages  where a greater percentage of the loan amount is usually covered by collateral 
nonetheless  any collateral or personal guarantees obtained on commercial loans can mitigate the increased risk and help to reduce credit losses 
our approach to commercial lending involves teams of lending and cash management personnel who focus on marketing loans  deposits and other bank services to new and existing commercial clients 
we have also been successful in hiring experienced personnel with established networks of business contacts to support commercial sales efforts 
sustained long term growth in this loan category will be dependent upon local economic conditions  interest rate levels  competitive market conditions and other external factors 
real estate construction construction loans offered include both residential and commercial development projects 
each construction project is evaluated for economic viability and maximum loan to value ratios of on commercial projects and on residential projects are generally required 
a construction loan poses higher credit risks than typical secured loans 
in addition to the financial strength of the borrower  construction loans have the added element of completion risk  which is the risk that the project will not be completed on time and within budget  resulting in additional costs that could affect the economic viability of the project 
careful consideration of the ability and reputation of the developer and close monitoring of a project during the construction phase by construction lending specialists is required to mitigate the higher level of risk in construction lending 
the increase in our construction loan portfolio in each of the five years presented above is representative of our historic focus on this segment  a real estate market that had been strong until recently and increased development activity in all of our markets 
however  construction loans exhibited higher levels of risk in with some borrowers abandoning their construction plans and defaulting on their loans due to a range of factors including declining real estate values 
there has been significant deterioration in the construction loan market  particularly in california  presenting a negative outlook in for current projects and fewer new construction projects than in previous years 
furthermore  construction loans tend to be larger in amount and shorter in term than conventional commercial or mortgage loans  thus a higher level of volatility in balances from year to year is expected 
we anticipate future decreases in our california real estate construction loan portfolio as we may look to minimize our exposure in this market by possibly packaging and selling some of our construction loans 
real estate mortgage table sets forth information with respect to the composition of the real estate mortgage loan portfolio as of the dates indicated

maximum loan to value ratios of are typically required  although higher levels are permitted with accompanying mortgage insurance 
we emphasize residential mortgage loans for owner occupied primary residences and do not actively seek loans on high end residences  vacation homes and investment properties 
first mortgage loans secured by residential properties generally carry a moderate level of credit risk 
with an average loan size of approximately  readily marketable collateral and a residential real estate market that has been relatively stable until recently  credit losses on residential mortgages have been minimal during the past several years 
however  future changes in interest rates and other market factors can impact the marketability of collateral and thus the level of credit risk inherent in the portfolio 
as with all loans  managing credit risk in the residential mortgage market entails strong underwriting standards and diligent monitoring and handling of problems as they arise 
residential mortgage loan balances as of december  totaled billion  increasing by million  or  over the million at year end  which increased by million  or  over the million held at year end several factors have lead to an increase in mortgage origination activity in including our establishment of strategic alliances with real estate brokers and developers that provide additional mortgage origination opportunities and decreased competition as several national lenders have recently exited the hawaii market 
substantially all salable fixed rate mortgages are sold in the secondary market 
mortgage loans held for sale at december  totaled million  an increase of million  or  over the december  balance of million  which decreased by million  or  over the december  balance of million 
the increase in loans held for sale as of december  is reflective of the increase in origination activity experienced during the projected cooling of the hawaii residential real estate market in is expected to have a stabilizing effect on origination activity  while market rates will dictate the level of refinancing activity in commercial real estate mortgage loans secured by commercial properties continues to represent the single largest component of our loan portfolio 
our policy with respect to commercial mortgages is that loans be made for sound purposes  have a definite source and or plan of repayment established at inception  and be backed up by reliable secondary sources of repayment and satisfactory collateral with good marketability 
loans secured by commercial property carry a greater risk than loans secured by residential property due to operating income risk 
operating income risk is the risk that the borrower will be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from the operation of the property 
the commercial real estate market and interest rate conditions through economic cycles will impact risk levels 
to mitigate the risks inherent in commercial mortgage lending  we strive to use dedicated  experienced commercial mortgage lenders to underwrite  monitor and service commercial mortgage loans 
nevertheless  commercial mortgage lending generated by our california loan production offices exposes us to certain new risks  including the risk of economic downturn in the california market and a reliance on a relatively small staff positioned in the california market 
the increase in our commercial mortgage loan portfolio of million  or  over the prior year was primarily attributed to unanticipated payoffs in resulting from the sales of underlying collateral 
the commercial real estate market has not experienced quite the level of slowdown as evidenced in the us residential real estate market  however  there can be no assurances that a slowdown will not affect this sector 
we expect our loan origination activity to decline in as a result of changes in market conditions  our applying an increasingly calculated approach to our commercial mortgage lending activities and anticipated payoffs from our existing portfolio

considerations include an evaluation of the quality  character and inherent risks in the loan portfolio  current and projected economic conditions and past loan loss experience 
consumer loans represent a moderate credit risk 
loans in this category are generally either unsecured or secured by personal assets such as automobiles 
the average loan size is generally small and risk is diversified among many borrowers 
we utilize credit scoring systems for most of our consumer loans  which offer the ability to modify credit exposure based on our risk tolerance and loss experience 
consumer loans totaled million at december   increasing by million  or  from s year end balance of million  which increased by million  or  compared to the million held at year end the increase in was reflective of the purchase of a million automobile loan portfolio in automobile loans  primarily indirect dealer loans  comprised of consumer loans outstanding 
total automobile loans of million at year end increased by million  or  from s year end balance of million  which increased by million  or  over the million at year end we have not focused significant resources on consumer lending in recent years as several large competitors have dominated the hawaii market 
with the exception of indirect dealer loans  consumer loans are generally offered as an accommodation to existing customers 
we expect consumer lending to remain a relatively small segment of our lending business 
concentrations of credit risk as of december   approximately of loans outstanding were real estate related loans  including construction loans  residential mortgage loans and commercial mortgage loans 
the real estate market tends to closely follow broader economic trends and while during periods of economic strength  the real estate market and the real estate industry typically perform well  during periods of economic weakness  they often slow down 
in  market interest rates and other economic conditions had a significant and immediate impact on the real estate industry 
accordingly  as we have seen during the second half of  the concentration of lending in the real estate industry led to adverse portfolio performance  namely delinquencies and loan charge offs 
our loan portfolio will continue to be adversely affected should the real estate market continue to suffer a downturn 
most of our loans are made to companies and individuals with headquarters in or residing in the states of hawaii  california and washington 
consistent with our focus of being a hawaii based bank  of our loan growth stemmed from our lending activities within the state of hawaii 
loans originated by our mainland loan production offices accounted for approximately of total loan growth in at december   of our loan portfolio was concentrated in the hawaii market  while was concentrated in california and the remaining in washington 
as a result of the uncertain market conditions in the california real estate market  we anticipate that substantially all of our loan growth will come from the hawaii market in to ensure that risks associated with industry concentration or geographic concentration are properly managed  we employ highly qualified lenders with established client relationships  similar lending philosophies and demonstrated expertise in their respective markets

meanwhile  loans in the one through five years category decreased from at year end to at year end  and loans in the greater than five years category decreased from to 
the shift in maturities reflects our increased focus on construction lending  which generally entails shorter terms than traditional commercial loans

in january  we entered into a derivative transaction to hedge cashflows received from a portion of our then existing variable rate loan portfolio for a period of five years 
during this time  we will receive payments equal to a fixed interest rate of from the counterparty on a notional amount of million and  in return  we will pay to the counterparty a floating rate  namely our prime rate  on the same notional amount 
provision and allowance for loan and lease losses as described above in critical accounting policies and use of estimates  the provision is determined by management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio and our assessment of the ability of the allowance to cover inherent losses 
our methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance and the provision takes into account many factors  including the level and trend of nonperforming and potential problem loans  net charge off experience  current repayment by borrowers  fair value of collateral securing specific loans  changes in lending and underwriting standards and general economic factors  nationally and in the markets we serve 
the allowance consists of two components allocated and unallocated 
to calculate the allocated component  we combine specific reserves required for individual loans including impaired loans  reserves required for pooled graded loans and loan concentrations  and reserves required for homogeneous loans eg  consumer loans and residential mortgage loans 
we use a loan grading system whereby loans are segregated by risk 
certain graded commercial and commercial real estate loans are analyzed on an individual basis 
other graded loans are analyzed on an aggregate basis based on loss experience for the specific loan type  risks inherent in concentrations by geographic location  collateral or property type  and recent changes in loan grade and delinquencies 
the determination of an allocated allowance for homogeneous loans is done on an aggregate level based upon various factors including historical loss experience  delinquency trends and economic conditions 
the unallocated component of the allowance incorporates our judgment of the determination of the risks inherent in the loan portfolio  economic uncertainties and imprecision in the estimation process 
table sets forth certain information with respect to the allowance as of the dates or for the periods indicated

drop off in home sale activity in california coupled with significant discounts offered by several national homebuilders to move unsold inventory contributed heavily to slowing absorption rates and declining collateral values 
during the fourth quarter of  these problems were compounded by diminishing guarantor liquidity for some of our borrowers in this market 
the aforementioned market conditions that began to unfold in august of required us to downgrade loans to  and within  our criticized risk rating categories 
the outstanding principal balance of these loans aggregated million and was comprised of thirteen residential construction loans totaling million  seven land acquisition and development loans totaling million and ten land loans for mixed use development of million 
of these loans  one loan for million was originated during the first half of  fourteen loans totaling million were originated in and fifteen loans totaling million were originated in the majority of these loans were earmarked for development projects located in the inland empire and central valley regions of california  areas that have been particularly hard hit by the real estate slowdown in california 
in addition to the downgrade of these loans  our credit policies and procedures also required us to increase the loan loss factors assigned to outstanding balances with direct exposure to the california residential market and increase the amount of specific reserves established for nine california residential construction loans to seven borrowers with an outstanding principal balance of million 
the downgrade of the aforementioned loans  the increase in our california residential construction loan loss factor and the increase to our specific reserves described above resulted in an increase of million to our provision in the second half of accordingly  our provision increased to million in  compared to million in and million in we believe this increase was necessary to maintain the adequacy of the allowance given the current credit risk inherent in our loan portfolio and the current risk composition of our outstanding balances 
we continue to monitor our exposure to the california residential real estate market 
further deterioration in this market or any other market that we serve  may require us to increase our allowance  increase our provision and may result in increased net charge offs 
we have reorganized our operations and retained outside real estate professionals to assist us with collections and work out plans for some of our california loans 
our plans may include potential loan restructures  note sales and or asset sales 
net loan charge offs of million in increased by million over the net loans charge offs of million in  which increased from million in the increase in charge offs recognized in was driven primarily by an increase in charge offs in our real estate construction portfolio due to the aforementioned deterioration in the california residential construction market and our commercial  financial and agricultural portfolio 
the majority of commercial  financial and agricultural loan charge offs were isolated to two borrowers totaling million 
recoveries of million in came primarily from consumer loans  which totaled million  and commercial loans  which totaled million 
the allowance as a percentage of loans was at year end  compared to at year end and at year end the increase in the allowance in was again attributed to our exposure in the california residential construction market 
general economic conditions do not always affect all borrowers in the same way or to the same extent  and there remains the risk that other borrowers in other sectors of the economy will experience problems resulting in increased delinquencies and charge offs 
additionally  the local and national economies remain susceptible to global  national and local events which could adversely affect borrowers ability to repay their loans  collateral values  the level of nonperforming loans  net charge offs  provision and net income in the future 
table sets forth the allocation of the allowance by loan category as of the dates indicated 
our practice is to make specific allocations on impaired loans and general allocations to each loan category based on management s risk assessment and estimated loss rate 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is maintained to provide for additional credit risk which may exist but not be adequately accounted for in the specific and unspecified allocations due to the amount of judgment involved in the determination of the allowance  the absence of perfect knowledge of all credit risks and the amount of uncertainty in predicting the strength of the economy and the sustainability of that strength

allowance allocated to commercial loans at year end totaled million  or  of total commercial loans  compared to million  or  of total commercial loans as of year end the decrease in the allocated allowance reflects the decrease in commercial loans outstanding and the relatively low net charge offs experienced in the past several years 
allowance allocated to construction loans totaled million  or  of construction loans at year end  compared to million  or  of construction loans outstanding at year end the increase in the amount of allowance allocated to construction loans is a direct result of the aforementioned market conditions in california 
at year end  the allowance allocated to our construction loan portfolio in california was approximately million  or  of our total california construction loan portfolio 
construction loans in general have a higher level of inherent risk as compared to other types of loans 
the allocated allowance for residential mortgage loans was million  or  of related loans at year end  compared to million  or  at year end the increase in the allocated allowance reflects the increase in balances during the period 
commercial mortgage loans were allocated an allowance of million  or  of those loans at year end  increasing from million  or  of commercial mortgage loans at year end the increase in allocated allowance reflects the increase in balances during the year and the absence of commercial mortgage charge offs during the past four years 
the allocated allowance for consumer loans at year end was million  or  of consumer loans  compared to million  or  of related loans a year ago 
we also allocated allowance for leases of million  or  of total leases compared to million  or  of total leases as of year end while we have not had extensive experience in our lease portfolio  which was acquired in primarily in conjunction with the cb bancshares merger  we believe  based on our analysis of the lease portfolio  that there are inherent credit risks that we have recognized in our allowance 
the unallocated portion of the allowance decreased to million as of year end  compared to million in  as more known and perceived risks attributable to particular market segments and geographical risk considerations have been incorporated into the determination of the allocated allowance

the increase in nonperforming assets was partially offset by the payoff of a million nonaccrual residential mortgage loan and the charge off of million in commercial loans from a single borrower 
nonaccrual loans at december  included million in commercial loans to a construction contractor and a million residential mortgage loan that was subsequently paid off in in  six loans to two borrowers in the california residential construction market were downgraded  resulting in approximately million of additional nonaccrual loans in january we believe our loss exposure on nonaccrual loans has been adequately provided for in our allowance as of december  accruing loans delinquent for days or more at year end totaled million and remained relatively unchanged from the prior year 
the accruing loans delinquent for days or more at year end represented small loans primarily less than  each in various stages of collection

deposits our ability to raise low cost funds is a principal contributor to our profitability and the primary source of funding is deposits in the state of hawaii 
in this competitive market  we strive to distinguish ourselves by providing quality customer service in our branch offices and establishing long term relationships with businesses and their principals 
our focus has been to develop a large  stable base of core deposits  which are comprised of noninterest bearing demand  interest bearing demand and savings deposits and time deposits under  time deposits in amounts of  and greater are generally considered to be more price sensitive than relationship based and are thus given less focus in our marketing and sales efforts 
despite operating in a very competitive market  we were able to grow total deposits to billion at december   an increase of million  or  over the year end balance of billion  which increased by million  or  over the year end balance of billion 
noninterest bearing demand deposits of million at year end increased by million  or  from s year end balance of million  which decreased by million  or  from the million held at year end interest bearing deposits at december  of billion increased by million  or  over the billion held at year end  which increased by million  or  compared to year end time deposits increased in as depositors sought the higher returns offered on our time deposit products 
the majority of the increase in time deposits came from individual accounts with balances of  or more  which increased by million  or  in during  we again focused most of our marketing resources on our flagship exceptional checking and exceptional money market savings accounts  whose combined balances of million at year end increased by million  or  during the year 
we also introduced two new deposit products called remote deposit central and choice checking 
remote deposit central is a remote deposit service for business customers that allows them to deposit checks from the comfort of their office or home office 
our choice checking account is a checking account that allows customers to earn a time deposit like interest rate if certain requirements are met including direct deposits into the account  using a check card to pay for daily purchases and making payments online 
notwithstanding the efforts of our exceptional campaigns and introduction of new deposit products  total core deposits noninterest bearing demand  interest bearing demand and savings and time deposits under  decreased by million  or  during  and the ratio of core deposits to total deposits declined to at year end from at year end and at year end the decrease in core deposit composition over the past two years coupled with the increase in time deposits reflects customers reallocation of idle funds into higher yielding alternative investment products 
we expect to continue our deposit growth strategy in  focusing primarily on core deposits  through competitive pricing and more aggressive marketing and customer calling campaigns 
table sets forth information regarding the average deposits and the average rates paid for certain deposit categories for each of the years indicated 
average balances are computed using daily average balances 
the average rates paid on all categories of deposits increased in due to increases in market interest rates in the hawaii deposit market 
the average rate on time deposits  which are most sensitive to changes in market rates  increased by basis points in  while savings and money market deposit rates increased by basis points 
the average rate paid on all deposits in increased to from in and in the increases in average rates paid in and were attributable to strong competition for core deposits from other hawaii financial institutions as well as from internet based and other financial services companies located outside of hawaii 
we expect deposit rates to decrease in in response to recent rate cuts by the us federal reserve 
the magnitude of rate movements in our deposit base will depend in large part on competitive pricing considerations and the level of deposit growth needed to support our lending activities

the decrease in was attributable to the reduction in net income resulting from the aforementioned increase in provision for loan and lease losses and the goodwill impairment charge relating to the goodwill associated with our commercial real estate reporting segment 
partially offsetting the effects of the reduction in net income for was the repurchase and retirement of approximately million shares of the company s common stock under repurchase plans at an aggregate cost of million as we viewed the company s common stock to be an attractive investment alternative

repurchases under the repurchase plan may be made from time to time on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
asset liability management and interest rate risk our earnings and capital are sensitive to risk of interest rate fluctuations 
interest rate risk arises when rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities mature or reprice during different periods or in differing amounts 
in the normal course of business  we are subjected to interest rate risk through the activities of making loans and taking deposits  as well as from our investment securities portfolio and other interest bearing funding sources 
asset liability management attempts to coordinate our rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities to meet our financial objectives 
our asset liability management policy seeks to maximize the risk adjusted return to shareholders while maintaining consistently acceptable levels of liquidity  interest rate risk and capitalization 
our asset liability management committee  or alco  monitors interest rate risk through the use of interest rate sensitivity gap  net interest income and market value of portfolio equity simulation and rate shock analyses 
this process is designed to measure the impact of future changes in interest rates on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity 
adverse interest rate risk exposures are managed through the shortening or lengthening of the duration of assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk can be analyzed by monitoring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap and changes in the gap over time 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  the earnings of an institution with a positive gap theoretically may be positively affected due to its interest earning assets repricing to a greater extent than its interest bearing liabilities 
an adverse impact would be expected for an institution with a negative gap 
table sets forth information regarding our interest rate sensitivity gap at december  the assumptions used in determining interest rate sensitivity of various asset and liability products had a significant impact on the resulting table 
for purposes of this presentation  assets and liabilities are classified by the earliest repricing date or maturity 
all interest bearing demand and savings balances are included in the three months or less category  even though repricing of these accounts is not contractually required and may not actually occur during that period 
since all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same velocity or magnitude  and since volatility is subject to change  the interest rate sensitivity gap is only a general indicator of interest rate risk

table presents information on financial instruments held that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for purposes of this presentation  expected maturities of interest sensitive assets and liabilities are contractual maturities 
interest bearing demand and savings deposits  which have indeterminate maturities  are included in the earliest maturity category 
the resulting table is based on numerous assumptions including prepayment rates on mortgage related assets and forecasted market interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the calculation of fair values 
at december   holdings of shorter term interest sensitive assets and liabilities increased relative to year end primarily due to increases in our variable rate loan portfolio resulting from loan growth and time deposits as customers sought higher returns 
maturities and fair values of interest sensitive assets and liabilities may vary from expectation if actual experience differs from the assumptions used 
liquidity our objective in managing our liquidity is to maintain a balance between sources and uses of funds in order to economically meet the cash requirements of customers for loans and deposit withdrawals and to participate in lending and investment opportunities as they arise 
we monitor our liquidity position in relation to trends of loan demand and deposit growth on a daily basis to assure maximum utilization  maintenance of an adequate level of readily marketable assets and access to short term funding sources 
during  our overall liquidity position declined as loan growth exceeded the increase in deposits and as we increased our level of common stock repurchases 
the consolidated statements of cash flows identify the three major categories of sources and uses of cash as operating  investing and financing activities 
as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows  cash provided by operating activities has provided a steady source of funds during the past three years 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  million in and million in the primary source of cash provided by operating activities continues to be our net income  excluding non cash items 
investing activities have resulted in a use of cash in each of the last three years 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million in  million in and million in investment securities and lending activities generally comprise the largest components of investing activities  although the level of investment securities activities are impacted by the relationship of loan and deposit growth during the period 
in  net loan originations accounted for million of cash used  compared to million in and million in net proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities totaled million in and million in compared to net purchases of investment securities of million in investing activities in and also included purchases of bank owned life insurance policies totaling million and million  respectively 
investing activities in included the cash consideration paid in the hhl acquisition  net of cash and cash equivalents held by that entity at the time of the acquisition 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million in  million in and million in deposit activities  borrowings and capital transactions represent the major components of financing activities 
net deposit growth resulted in cash inflows of million in  million in and million in cash flows from the issuance of long term debt  net of repayments thereon  totaled million in cash inflows in compared to million in cash outflows in and million in cash inflows in as with investment securities  the level of net borrowings is impacted by the levels of loan and deposit growth during the period 
capital transactions  primarily dividends and the issuance or repurchase of common stock  required cash outflows of million and million in and  respectively  and provided cash inflows of million in proceeds from the sale of common stock in included million generated from a common stock offering of million shares 
we expect that loan demand in will approximate deposit growth  resulting in limited additional liquidity needs 
alternative funding sources  which include the federal home loan bank of seattle  secured repurchase agreements  federal funds borrowings  brokered certificates of deposit and the federal reserve bank  are available to meet our liquidity needs 
for the holding company on a stand alone basis  the primary uses of funds in included share repurchases totaling million and dividend payments which totaled million 
the primary source of funds in was dividends received from central pacific bank 
other sources of funds in the past have included million in proceeds from the common stock offering in off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements to meet the financing needs of our banking customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and financial guarantees written  forward foreign exchange contracts  forward interest rate contracts and interest rate swaps and options 
these instruments and the related off balance sheet exposures are discussed in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the unlikely event that we must satisfy a significant amount of outstanding commitments to extend credit  liquidity will be adversely impacted  as will credit risk 
the remaining components of off balance sheet arrangements  primarily interest rate options and forward interest rate contracts related to our mortgage banking activities  are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
impact of new accounting standards various accounting authorities including the financial accounting standards board  the american institute of certified public accountants and the securities and exchange commission issue authoritative guidance on accounting policies and disclosure requirements
