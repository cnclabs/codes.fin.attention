item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following presents management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as of the dates and for the periods indicated 
you should read this discussion in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this report  and the description of business contained in item of this report 
this discussion contains forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ significantly from these forward looking statements 
overview mig  through its property and casualty insurance subsidiaries  provides a wide array of property and casualty insurance products designed to meet the insurance needs of individuals in new jersey and pennsylvania  and small and medium sized businesses throughout arizona  california  nevada  new jersey  oregon and pennsylvania 
the group manages its business in three segments commercial lines insurance  personal lines insurance  and investments 
the commercial lines insurance and personal lines insurance segments are managed based on underwriting results determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  and the investment segment is managed based on after tax investment returns 
in determining the results of each segment  assets are not allocated to segments and are reviewed in the aggregate for decision making purposes 
the group s net income is primarily determined by four elements net premium income  underwriting cost and agent commissions  investment income  amounts paid or reserved to settle insured claims 
variations in premium income are subject to a number of factors  including limitations on rates arising from competitive market place conditions or regulation  limitation on available business arising from a need to maintain the pricing and quality of underwritten risks  the group s ability to maintain it s a excellent rating by am best  
table of contents the ability of the group to maintain a reputation for efficiency and fairness in claims administration  the availability  cost and terms of reinsurance 
variations on investment income are subject to a number of factors  including general interest rate levels  specific adverse events affecting the issuers of debt obligations held by the group  changes in prices of equity securities generally and those held by the group specifically 
loss and loss adjustment expenses are affected by a number of factors  including the quality of the risks underwritten by the group  the nature and severity of catastrophic losses  weather related patterns in areas where we insured property risks  the availability  cost and terms of reinsurance  underlying settlement costs  including medical and legal costs 
the group seeks to manage each of the foregoing to the extent within its control 
many of the foregoing factors are partially  or entirely  outside the control of the group 
critical accounting policies general we are required to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operation will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time 
we believe the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
liabilities for loss and loss adjustment expenses the liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses represents estimates of the ultimate unpaid cost of all losses incurred  including losses for claims that have not yet been reported to our insurance companies 
the amount of loss reserves for reported claims is based primarily upon a case by case evaluation of the type of risk involved  knowledge of the circumstances surrounding each claim and the insurance policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
the amounts of loss reserves for unreported claims and loss adjustment expenses are determined using historical information by line of insurance as adjusted to current conditions 
inflation is ordinarily implicitly provided for in the reserving function through analysis of costs  trends and reviews of historical reserving results over multiple years 
reserves are closely monitored and are recomputed periodically using the most recent information on reported claims and a variety of actuarial techniques 
specifically  on a quarterly basis  we review  by line of business  existing reserves  new claims  changes to existing case reserves  and paid losses with respect to the current and prior accident years 
we use historical paid and incurred losses and accident year data to derive expected ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense ratios by line of business 
we then apply these expected loss and loss adjustment expense ratios to earned premium to derive a reserve level for each line of business 
in connection with the determination of the reserves  we also consider other specific factors such as recent weather related losses  trends in historical paid losses  and legal and judicial trends with respect to theories of liability 
some of our business relates to coverage for short term risks  and for these risks loss development is comparatively rapid and historical paid losses  adjusted for known variables  have been a reliable predictive measure of future losses for purposes of our reserving 
some of our business relates to longer term risks  where the claims are slower to emerge and the estimate of damage is more 
table of contents difficult to predict 
for these lines of business  more sophisticated actuarial methods  such as the bornhuetter ferguson loss development methods see methods below are employed to project an ultimate loss expectation  and then the related loss history must be regularly evaluated and loss expectations updated  with the possibility of variability from the initial estimate of ultimate losses 
a substantial portion of the business written by fpic is this type of longer tailed casualty business 
when a claim is reported to us  our claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
this estimate reflects an informed judgment based upon general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of the estimator 
the individual estimating the reserve considers the nature and value of the specific claim  the severity of injury or damage  and the policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
case reserves are adjusted by our claims staff as more information becomes available 
it is our policy to settle each claim as expeditiously as possible 
we maintain ibnr reserves to provide for already incurred claims that have not yet been reported and developments on reported claims 
the ibnr reserve is determined by estimating our insurance companies ultimate net liability for both reported and ibnr claims and then subtracting the case reserves and payments made to date for reported claims 
methods used to estimate loss loss adjustment expense reserves we apply the following general methods in projecting loss and loss adjustment expense reserves for the group paid loss development  paid bornhuetter ferguson loss development  reported loss development  reported bornhuetter ferguson loss development  and separate developments of claims frequency and severity 
in addition  we apply several diagnostic ratio tests of the reserves for long tailed liability lines of business  including but not limited to retrospective tests of the ratios of ibnr reserves to earned premiums and to estimated ultimate incurred losses  retrospective tests of the ratios of the loss reserves to earned premiums and to estimated ultimate incurred losses  ratios of cumulative and incremental incurred and paid losses to earned premiums and to estimated ultimate incurred losses  ratios of cumulative and incremental paid losses to cumulative incurred losses and ratios of incremental paid losses to prior case loss and lae reserves  ratios of cumulative average incurred loss per claim and cumulative average incurred loss per reported claim  and ratios of cumulative average paid loss per claim closed with payment and of average case reserve per pending claim 
description of ultimate loss estimation methods the reported loss development method relies on the assumption that  at any given state of maturity  ultimate losses can be predicted by multiplying cumulative reported losses paid losses plus case reserves by a cumulative development factor 
the validity of the results of this method depends on the stability of claim reporting and settlement rates  as well as the consistency of case reserve levels 
case reserves do not have to be adequately stated for this method to be effective  they only need to have a fairly consistent level of adequacy at comparable stages of maturity 
historical age to age loss development factors are calculated to measure the relative development of an 
table of contents accident year from one maturity point to the next 
we then selected appropriate age to age loss development factors based on these historical factors and use the selected factors to project the ultimate losses 
the paid loss development method is mechanically identical to the incurred loss development method described above with the exception that paid losses replace reported losses 
the paid method does not rely on case reserves or their adequacy in making projections 
the validity of the results from using a loss development approach can be affected by many conditions  such as internal claim department processing changes  a shift between single and multiple claim payments  legal changes  or variations in a company s mix of business from year to year 
also  since the percentage of losses paid for immature years is often low  development factors are volatile 
a small variation in the number of claims paid can have a leveraging effect that can lead to significant changes in estimated ultimates 
therefore  ultimate values for immature accident years are often based on alternative estimation techniques 
the bornhuetter ferguson expected loss projection method based on reported loss data relies on the assumption that remaining unreported losses are a function of the total expected losses rather than a function of currently reported losses 
the expected losses used in this analysis are selected judgmentally based upon the historical relationship between premiums and losses for more mature accident years  adjusted to reflect changes in average rates and expected changes in claims frequency and severity 
the expected losses are multiplied by the unreported percentage to produce expected unreported losses 
the unreported percentage is calculated as one minus the reciprocal of the selected incurred loss development factors 
finally  the expected unreported losses are added to the current reported losses to produce ultimate losses 
the calculations underlying the bornhuetter ferguson expected loss projection method based on paid loss data are similar to the incurred bornhuetter ferguson calculations with the exception that paid losses and unpaid percentages replace reported losses and unreported percentages 
the bornhuetter ferguson method is most useful as an alternative to other models for immature accident years 
for these immature years  the amounts reported or paid may be small and unstable and therefore not predictive of future development 
therefore  future development is assumed to follow an expected pattern that is supported by more stable historical data or by emerging trends 
this method is also useful when changing reporting patterns or payment patterns distort the historical development of losses 
for the property lines of business special property  personal auto physical damage  and commercial auto physical damage the results of the reserve calculations were similar and we generally rely on an averaging of the methods utilized 
for the homeowners and commercial multi peril lines of business excluding california cmp business for policy years and prior we generally rely on the incurred loss development and incurred bornhuetter ferguson methods in estimating loss reserves 
these two methods yield more consistent results although the two paid methods yielded reserves that were similar in total to the incurred methods 
in july of  the california supreme court rendered its opinion of admiral insurance company vs 
montrose chemical corporation the montrose decision 
in that decision  the supreme court ruled that in the case of a continuous and progressively deteriorating loss  such as pollution liability or construction defect liability  an insurance company has a definitive duty to defend the policyholder until all uncertainty related to the severity and cause of the loss is extinguished 
after the montrose decision  fpic a subsidiary of the group since october  experienced a significant increase in construction defect liability cases impacting our west coast commercial multi peril liability lines of business  to which it would not have been subject under the old interpretation of the law 
in response  fpic prior to its acquisition by the group implemented a series of underwriting measures to limit the prospective exposure to montrose and construction defect liability claims 
these changes to coverage and risk selection resulted in an improvement in the post montrose underwriting results 
fpic evaluates commercial multi peril liability reserves by segregating pre and post montrose activity as well as segregating contractor versus non contractor experience 
an inception to date ground up incurred loss database was created as the basis for this new analysis 
the pre montrose activity is evaluated on a report year basis 
table of contents which eliminates the accident year development distortions caused by the effects of the montrose decision 
for policy years and later  the reserves are analyzed using the more traditional accident year analysis 
for the casualty lines commercial multi peril liability  other liability  personal auto liability  commercial auto liability  workers compensation the paid loss development method yielded less than reliable results for the immature years and we did not use the method in selecting ultimate losses and reserves 
for these lines we primarily relied on the incurred bornhuetter ferguson method for the most recent accident years and both of the incurred loss development methods for the remaining years 
the property and casualty industry has incurred substantial aggregate losses from claims related to asbestos related illnesses  environmental remediation  product and mold  and other uncertain or environmental exposures 
we have not experienced significant losses from these types of claims 
we compute our estimated ultimate liability using these principles and procedures applicable to the lines of business written 
however  because the establishment of loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process  we cannot be certain that ultimate losses will not exceed the established loss reserves and have a material adverse effect on the group s results of operations and financial condition 
changes in estimates  or differences between estimates and amounts ultimately paid  are reflected in the operating results of the period during which such adjustments are made 
reserves are estimates because there are uncertainties inherent in the determination of ultimate losses 
court decisions  regulatory changes and economic conditions can affect the ultimate cost of claims that occurred in the past as well as create uncertainties regarding future loss cost trends 
accordingly  the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss settlement expenses will likely differ from the amount recorded at december  the table below summarizes the effect on net loss reserves and surplus in the event of reasonably likely changes in the variables considered in establishing loss and loss adjustment expense reserves 
the range of reasonably likely changes was established based on a review of changes in accident year development by line of business and applied to loss reserves as a whole 
the selected range of changes does not indicate what could be the potential best or worst case or likely scenarios change in loss loss adjustment percentage loss adjustment percentage and loss reserves net of change in reserves net of change in adjustment reinsurance as of equity as of reinsurance as of equity as of reserves net of december  december  december  december  reinsurance dollars in thousands base   net of tax the group s consulting actuaries determined range of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves on a net basis range from a low of million to a high of million as of december  the group s net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are carried at million as of december  management s point estimate of reserves is at the higher end of its actuarially determined range in recognition of the inherent uncertainty in assessing the potential ultimate liabilities given legal developments as well as the evolution in its operations 
the evolution in its operations include such things as changes in coverage and pricing in response to market opportunity as well as higher reinsurance retentions and geographic and product diversification all of which affect management s reserve estimates

a decline in fair value of an investment below its cost that is deemed other than temporary is charged to earnings as a realized loss 
we monitor our investment portfolio and review investments that have experienced a decline in fair value below cost to evaluate whether the decline is other than temporary 
these evaluations involve judgment and consider the magnitude and reasons for a decline and the prospects for the fair value to recover in 
table of contents the near term 
in the years ended december   and  we recorded a pre tax charge to earnings of   and  respectively  for write downs of other than temporarily impaired securities 
in  these charges related to common stocks  in these charges related to fixed income securities  and in these charges related to preferred stocks and fixed income securities 
adverse investment market conditions  poor operating performance  or other adversity encountered by companies whose stock or fixed maturity securities we own could result in impairment charges in the future 
the group s policy on impairment of value of investments is as follows if a security has a market value below cost it is considered impaired 
for any such security a review of the financial condition and prospects of the company will be performed by the investment committee to determine if the decline in market value is other than temporary 
if it is determined that the decline in market value is other than temporary  the carrying value of the security will be written down to realizable value and the amount of the write down accounted for as a realized loss 
realizable value is defined for this purpose as the market price of the security 
write down to a value other than the market price requires objective evidence in support of that value 
in evaluating the potential impairment of fixed income securities  the investment committee will evaluate relevant factors  including but not limited to the following the issuer s current financial condition and ability to make future scheduled principal and interest payments  relevant rating history  analysis and guidance provided by rating agencies and analysts  the degree to which an issuer is current or in arrears in making principal and interest payments  and changes in price relative to the market 
in evaluating the potential impairment of equity securities  the investment committee will evaluate certain factors  including but not limited to the following the relationship of market price per share versus carrying value per share at the date of acquisition and the date of evaluation  the price to earnings ratio at the date of acquisition and the date of evaluation  any rating agency announcements  the issuer s financial condition and near term prospects  including any specific events that may influence the issuer s operations  the independent auditor s report on the issuer s financial statements  and any buy sell hold recommendations or price projections by outside investment advisors 
policy acquisition costs we defer policy acquisition costs  such as commissions  premium taxes and certain other underwriting expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the production of business 
these costs are amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of deferred costs to their estimated realizable value  which gives effect to the premium to be earned  related investment income  loss and loss adjustment expenses  and certain other costs expected to be incurred as the premium is earned 
future changes in estimates  the most significant of which is expected loss and loss adjustment expenses  may require acceleration of the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs 
if the estimation of net realizable value indicates that the acquisition costs are unrecoverable  further analyses are completed to determine if a reserve is required to provide for losses that may exceed the related unearned premiums 
reinsurance amounts recoverable from property and casualty reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with the claim liability associated with the reinsured policy 
amounts paid for reinsurance contracts are expensed over the contract period during which insured events are covered by the reinsurance contracts 
ceded unearned premiums and reinsurance balances recoverable on paid and unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are reported separately as assets  instead of being netted with the related liabilities  because reinsurance does not relieve us of our legal liability to our policyholders 
reinsurance balances recoverable are subject to credit risk associated with the particular reinsurer 
additionally  the same uncertainties associated with estimating unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses affect the estimates for the ceded portion of these liabilities 
we continually monitor the financial condition of our reinsurers 
many of the reinsurance treaties participated in by the group prior to and primarily fpic treaties have included provisions that establish minimum and maximum cessions and allow limited participation in the profit of the ceded business 
generally  the group shares on a limited basis in the profitability of our reinsurance treaties through contingent ceding commissions 
the group s exposure in the loss experience is contractually defined at minimum and 
table of contents maximum levels 
the terms of such contracts are fixed at inception 
since estimating the emergence of claims to the applicable reinsurance layers is subject to significant uncertainty  the net amounts that will ultimately be realized may vary significantly from the estimated amounts presented in the group s results of operations 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes arise from the recognition of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in the period of the enactment date 
contingencies besides claims related to its insurance products  the group is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and claims in the normal course of business 
the group assesses the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
there can be no assurance that actual outcomes will be consistent with those assessments 
results of operations revenue and income by segment is as follows for the years ended december   and in  the group evaluated its methodology for allocating costs to its lines of business and adopted changes to such methodology in order to more accurately reflect the allocation of joint costs 
this resulted in allocating less joint cost to the personal lines of business and more joint cost to the commercial lines of business  but with no net change in cost allocated to personal lines and commercial lines in the aggregate

table of contents the key elements of the group s business model are the sales of properly priced and underwritten personal and commercial property and casualty insurance through independent agents and the investment of the premiums in a manner designed to assure that claims and expenses can be paid while providing a return on the capital employed 
loss trends and investment performance are critical factors in influencing the success of the business model 
these factors are affected by the factors impacting the insurance industry in general and factors unique to the group as described in the following discussion 
our results of operations are influenced by factors affecting the property and casualty insurance industry in general 
the operating results of the united states property and casualty insurance industry are subject to significant variations due to competition  weather  catastrophic events  regulation  the availability and cost of satisfactory reinsurance  general economic conditions  judicial trends  fluctuations in interest rates and other changes in the investment environment 
our growth in premiums  underwriting results and investment income have been  and continue to be  influenced by market conditions  as well as the acquisition of fpig on october  the group s financial statements include fpig and its results of operations for the entire year of and and for the period of october  through december  our premiums earned mix reflects the group s focus on growing the commercial lines book  while working within our underwriting standards 
pricing in the property and casualty insurance industry historically has been and remains cyclical 
during a soft market cycle  price competition is prevalent  which makes it difficult to write and retain properly priced personal and commercial lines business 
our policy is to maintain disciplined underwriting and pricing standards during soft markets  declining business which is inadequately priced for its level of risk 
the current market is highly competitive  with pricing and coverage competition being seen in virtually all classes of commercial accounts  package policies  and commercial automobile policies and in the pennsylvania personal auto market and pennsylvania and new jersey homeowners markets  all of which impacts our ability to retain our accounts on renewal  or to renew a policy at expiring premium 
we continue to work with our agents to target classes of business and accounts compatible with our underwriting appetite  which includes certain types of religious institution risks  contracting risks  small business risks and property risks 
as a result of what management believes is a soft market  commercial lines direct written premium declined in  as compared to  due in part to increased competition and reduced audit premium on expired business  among other factors discussed more in detail below in the vs 
revenue discussion 
the availability of reinsurance at reasonable pricing is an important part of our business 
effective  january   the group increased its retention to  from a maximum retention of  in on the casualty  property and workers compensation lines of business 
as the group increases the net retention of the business it writes  net premiums written and earned will increase and ceded losses will decrease 
the impact of increased retentions under our reinsurance program in was offset in part by a decline in direct written premium due to the increasingly competitive marketplace 
as older reinsurance treaties run off  the impact described above of the new reinsurance program will become more evident in net premiums written and net premiums earned 
the group does not write homeowners insurance or other personal lines in california  nor does it have significant exposure to commercial risks in the areas affected by the recent wildfires in southern california 
consequently  the company expects to have very limited claim activity in connection with such wildfires 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the components of income for and  and the change and percentage change from year to year  are shown in the charts below 
the accompanying narrative refers to the statistical information displayed in the chart immediately above the narrative

see the investment income discussion below for further information 
in  direct premiums written decreased million or to million in as compared to million in the decline in direct premiums written is attributed to a more difficult economic environment and competitive market conditions  including a decline in construction related activity and related audit premium in california  increased competition on large accounts as well as the return of a number of competitors to the california contractor market and the east coast habitational market 
the decline in year to date audit premium  as compared to the prior year  relates to a general decline in construction related activity  specifically in california  driven by a slowdown of the residential housing market 
approximately of fpic s business and approximately one third of the group s business in total is related to artisan contractor liability  primarily in the central valley of california 
commercial multiple peril policies constitute a majority of the business written in fpic s contractor book of business 
the premium on these policies is estimated at policy inception based on a prediction of the volume of the insured s business operations during the policy period 
in addition to endorsing the policy throughout the policy period based on known information  at policy expiration fpic conducts an audit of the insured s business operations in order to adjust the policy premium from an estimate to actual 
contractor liability policy premium tends to vary with local construction activity as well as changes in the nature of the contractor s operations 
the decline in construction related activity has impacted both the volume of premium for the contractor in force book of business and related exposures and the related audit premium on expiring policies 
audits  primarily of construction related policies  generated million of premium in  representing a decline of million as compared to million of premium that was generated in 
table of contents the decline in year to date direct premiums written also reflects an increasingly competitive marketplace and what management characterizes as a soft market 
there has been increased competition on large accounts particularly in the east coast habitational and california contractor programs  as competitors aggressively compete for these higher premium accounts 
management continues to maintain its policy of disciplined underwriting and pricing standards  declining business which is inadequately priced for its level of risk 
effective january   fpic restructured its property reinsurance agreement covering the first million of loss from an quota share to an  excess of  excess of loss contract to take advantage of the group s combined capital 
the restructuring also included the assumption of ceded unearned premium at january  by fpic from the property quota share and casualty excess of loss agreements 
these assumed premiums were then ceded into the respective treaties  which due to the reduced ceding rates  resulted in a million increase in net written and earned premium for there was no similar impact in relating to this restructuring 
effective  january   the group consolidated the reinsurance program of all subsidiaries into a single program  and increased its reinsurance retention to  from a maximum retention of  in on the working layer for all casualty  property and workers compensation lines of business 
the effect of this change in reinsurance arrangements increased net premiums written for growth in net investment income is discussed below

the group has entered into four interest rate swap agreements to hedge against interest rate risk on its floating rate trust preferred securities 
the estimated fair value of the interest rates swaps is obtained from the third party financial institution counterparties 
the group marks the investments to market using these valuations and records the change in the economic value of the interest rate swaps as a realized gain or loss in the consolidated statement of earnings

the fixed income portfolio is invested in investment grade securities  with the exception of one corporate security held with a market value of million  and these unrealized losses primarily reflect the current interest rate environment 
the group does not believe theses declines are other than temporary due to the credit quality of the holdings 
the group currently has the ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery

in addition  the amortization of deferred acquisition costs is lower in as compared to due to the fact that when fpig was purchased on october   the accounting for the business combination required the group to begin accruing deferred acquisition costs from the date of acquisition 
lastly  underwriting expenses are impacted by the previously discussed changes in the and reinsurance program whereby less ceded premium is being recorded and accordingly less ceding commission is received on treaties in runoff  and most of the treaties effective january  do not provide for ceding commission  which increases underwriting expenses and net acquisition costs

in  investment income on fixed income securities increased million or to million in as compared to million in this was driven by an increase in long term interest rates  an increase in the average invested assets and the inclusion of fpig for the entire year of the group s tax equivalent yield yield adjusted for tax benefit received on tax exempt securities on fixed income securities increased to in compared to in since the acquisition of fpig  a much larger proportion of the group s premium writings relate to casualty  or longer tail  business 
by its nature  longer tail business requires more time for losses to manifest themselves  with the result that claims tend to be paid later on casualty claims than on other types of claims 
the later payment of claims associated with casualty reserves provides a company with the opportunity to use the funds  which will ultimately be paid out as claims  for a longer period of time  thus generating a larger relative portfolio of fixed income securities and higher investment income 
dividend income and interest income on cash and cash equivalents was stable in at million and million  respectively  as compared to at million and million  respectively

liquidity and capital resources our insurance companies generate sufficient funds from their operations and maintain a high degree of liquidity in their investment portfolios 
the primary source of funds to meet the demands of claim settlements and operating expenses are premium collections  investment earnings and maturing investments 
our insurance companies maintain investment and reinsurance programs that are intended to provide sufficient funds to meet their obligations without forced sales of investments 
this requires them to ladder the maturity of their portfolios and thereby maintain a portion of their investment portfolio in relatively short term and highly liquid assets to ensure the availability of funds 
the principal source of liquidity for the holding company which has modest expenses and does not currently  or for the foreseeable future  need a significant regular source of cash flow to cover these expenses other than its debt service on its indebtedness to mic and its quarterly dividend to shareholders is dividend payments and other fees received from the insurance subsidiaries  and payments it receives on the year note it received from the esop see below when the esop purchased shares at the time of the conversion 
the group s insurance companies are required by law to maintain a certain minimum surplus on a statutory basis  and are subject to risk based capital requirements and to regulations under which payment of a dividend from statutory surplus may be restricted and may require prior approval of regulatory authorities 
see discussion of restrictions on dividends and distributions in the section business regulation 
additionally  there is a covenant in the group s line of credit agreement that requires the group to maintain at least of its insurance companies capacity to pay dividends without state regulation pre approval 
as part of the funding of the acquisition of fpig  mic entered into a loan agreement with mig  by which it advanced on september   a loan of million with a year note and a fixed interest rate of  repayable in equal annual installments 
mig has no special limitations on its ability to take periodic dividends from its insurance subsidiaries except for normal dividend restrictions administered by the respective domiciliary state regulators as described above 
the group believes that the resources available to mig will be adequate for it to meet its obligation under the note to mic  the line of credit and its other expenses 
on march   june   september  and december   mig paid a quarterly shareholder dividend of per common share 
the amount of dividends paid out on these dates totaled million  which amount was funded from the group s insurance companies  for which approval was sought and received where necessary from each of the insurance companies primary regulators 
the group maintains an employee stock ownership plan esop  which purchased  shares from the group at the time of the conversion in return for a note bearing interest at on the principal amount of  mic makes annual contributions to the esop sufficient for it to make its required annual payment under the terms of the loan to the holding company 
it is anticipated that approximately of the original esop shares will be allocated annually to employee participants of the esop 
an expense charge is booked ratably during each year for the shares committed to be allocated to participants that year  determined with reference to the fair

the issuance of the shares to the esop was fully recognized in the additional paid in capital account at conversion  with a contra account entitled unearned esop shares established in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheet for the unallocated shares at an amount equal to their original per share purchase price 
shareholder dividends received on unallocated esop shares are used to pay down principal and interest owed on the loan to the holding company 
the group adopted a stock based incentive plan at its annual meeting of shareholders 
pursuant to that plan  the group may issue a total of  shares  which amount will increase automatically each year by of the number of shares outstanding at the end of the preceding year 
at december   the shares authorized under the plan have been increased under this provision to  shares

the repurchase of the additional  shares was completed on march  the repurchased shares will be held as treasury shares available for issuance in connection with the group s stock incentive plan 
in the aggregate   shares have been repurchased in the open market since the conversion  at an aggregate cost of million  or per share  with purchases totaling million  or per share

the payments were made in response to notices of deficiency issued by the division to the group 
pursuant to the protests  the group has received million in as a reimbursement of protested payments of retaliatory tax  including accrued interest  previously made by the group for the periods the refund has been recorded  after reduction for federal income tax  in the amount of million in the consolidated statement of earnings  with million recorded in the quarter ended june   and million recorded in the quarter ended september  
table of contents impact of inflation inflation increases consumers needs for property and casualty insurance coverage 
inflation also increases claims incurred by property and casualty insurers as property repairs  replacements and medical expenses increase 
these cost increases reduce profit margins to the extent that rate increases are not implemented on an adequate and timely basis 
we establish property and casualty insurance premiums levels before the amount of losses and loss expenses  or the extent to which inflation may affect these expenses  are known 
therefore  our insurance companies attempt to anticipate the potential impact of inflation when establishing rates 
because inflation has remained relatively low in recent years  financial results have not been significantly affected by inflation 
inflation also often results in increases in the general level of interest rates  and  consequently  generally results in increased levels of investment income derived from our investments portfolio

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
market risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we have exposure to three principal types of market risk through our investment activities interest rate risk  credit risk and equity risk 
our primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
we have not entered  and do not plan to enter  into any derivative financial instruments for hedging  trading or speculative purposes  other than the interest rate swap agreements that hedge the floating rate trust preferred securities which were assumed as part of the fpig acquisition on october  interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in interest rates 
our exposure to interest rate changes primarily results from our significant holdings of fixed rate investments 
fluctuations in interest rates have a direct impact on the market valuation of these securities 
our available for sale portfolio of fixed income securities is carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
therefore  an adverse change in market prices of these securities would result in losses reflected on the balance sheet 
the average duration of our fixed maturity investments  excluding mortgage backed securities that are subject to prepayment  was approximately years as of december  as a result  the market value of our investments may fluctuate in response to changes in interest rates 
in addition  we may experience investment losses to the extent our liquidity needs require the disposition of fixed maturity securities in unfavorable interest rate environments 
fluctuations in near term interest rates could have an impact on the results of operations and cash flows 
certain of these fixed income securities have call features 
in a declining interest rate environment  these securities may be called by their issuer and replaced with securities bearing lower interest rates 
in a rising interest rate environment  we may sell these securities rather than holding to maturity and receive less than we paid for them 
as a general matter  we do not attempt to match the durations of our assets with the durations of our liabilities 
our goal is to maximize the total return on all of our investments 
an important strategy that we employ to achieve this goal is to try to hold enough in cash and short term investments in order to avoid liquidating longer term investments to pay claims
