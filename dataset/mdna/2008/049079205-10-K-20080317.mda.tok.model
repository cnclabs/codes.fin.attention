we have owned of the equity of gt t since january commnet wireless  llc or commnet  an owner and operator of wholesale wireless networks in rural areas of the united states 
commnet provides wireless voice and data communications roaming services primarily to national  regional and local wireless carriers 
we acquired of the equity of commnet in september and the remaining in january bermuda digital communications  ltd

choice communications  llc or choice  a leading provider of fixed wireless broadband data services and wireless digital television services as well as dial up internet services  to retail and business customers in the us virgin islands 
we acquired choice in october and own of the equity of choice 
as a holding company  we provide management  technical  financial  regulatory  and marketing services to  and typically receive a management fee equal to approximately to of revenues from each operating subsidiary and our bdc affiliate 
because we currently do not control bdc  we account for our investment in that entity under the equity method 
earnings from bdc do not appear in our income from operations  but are instead reflected in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  net of tax  in the consolidated financial statements included in this report

for information about our business segments and geographical information about our operating revenues and long lived assets  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in the past  we generated most of our revenue and operating income from our gt t operations and we continue to rely on gt t for a majority of our revenues and profits 
gt t provides domestic wireline telephone service and international long distance service pursuant to an exclusive license from the government of guyana and provides wireless service on a non exclusive basis 
the rates that gt t may charge for its services are regulated by the public utility commission of guyana or puc  an independent regulatory body responsible for regulating telecommunications 
see business regulation of our gt t subsidiary 
the largest component of gt t s contribution to our consolidated revenue and profit has been from its international long distance business and that business still accounts for roughly half of gt t s revenue 
most of these revenues and profits are from payments by foreign carriers  which are denominated in us dollars  for handling international long distance calls originating by foreign carriers and terminating in guyana 
the rates at which gt t collects fees from foreign carriers are established by agreements between it and foreign carriers  and can be affected by limits set by foreign telecommunications regulators  especially the us federal communications commission or fcc 
the primary drivers of the long distance business are the population of guyanese living abroad who initiate calls to guyana  the rate foreign carriers pay gt t for handling the incoming international calls  and the number of people in guyana capable of receiving international long distance calls  which consist of wireline telephone customers and all the wireless subscribers in guyana including subscribers to competitor wireless service providers 
in addition  in recent years  we believe various methods of illegal bypass and alternative and cheaper media for communication  such as e mail and text messaging  may have had a negative impact on both voice traffic and on international long distance revenues 
we have taken a number of measures to counter illegal bypass  including taking action against unlicensed operators in guyana  introducing special outbound call center rates and we are examining automated technical solutions as well 
in and  we entered new businesses and markets through our acquisitions of commnet and sovernet 
these businesses have provided us with new sources of revenues and with additional growth opportunities 
as a result  while gt t continues to represent a majority of our revenues and profits  its relative contribution to our consolidated revenues and consolidated net income has declined in recent years 
for fiscal years  and  gt t generated approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues 
for fiscal years and  gt t generated approximately and  respectively  of our consolidated net income 
commnet generated approximately and of our wireless revenue for and  respectively and accounted for approximately and of the increase in wireless revenue during and sovernet  acquired in february  generated approximately and of our local telephone and data revenue for and  respectively  and accounted for approximately and of the increase in local telephone and data revenue during and we are actively evaluating additional acquisition opportunities of businesses that meet our return on investment and other acquisition criteria 
as a result of our underwritten public offering of common stock in july  we raised net proceeds of approximately million  of which a portion was used to repay outstanding indebtedness  and the remainder of which we have used or plan to use to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions and or strategic investments and general corporate purposes 
recent developments guyana operations 
we continue to face challenges with our gt t operations in guyana 
since  the government of guyana has stated its intention to introduce additional competition into guyana s telecommunications sector  including conducting formal discussions with gt t in regarding this matter 
most recently  in february and march  at the request of the government  gt t met with high ranking members of the government to discuss potential modifications of gt t s exclusivity rights and the introduction of competition for domestic fixed local exchange and international voice and data services 
we believe that such competition is precluded by the exclusivity provisions of our license  which has a stated expiration in december and is renewable for an additional year term at our option 
we believe that any early termination of our exclusivity would require our consent and appropriate compensation to gt t  including but not limited to  an adjustment of service rates to reflect the real economic cost to gt t of providing such services 
further  we believe that certain modifications to the legal and regulatory regime governing the telecommunications market sector in guyana would be needed  as well as the satisfactory resolution of certain long standing claims between us and the government relating to certain tax and other matter as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  for us to consider voluntarily relinquishing gt t s rights by law and contract to be the exclusive provider of international voice and date services in guyana 
although discussions are currently in preliminary stages and are ongoing  the government has indicated to us a desire to introduce competition in international services in late at this time  we do not know if there will be any regulatory developments in guyana that will have the effect of terminating or limiting our exclusive international voice and data or domestic fixed license  and if so  the timing of any such developments and whether they would be pursuant to an agreement between us and the government 
other than entering into such an agreement on terms acceptable to us  we would seek to enforce gt t s rights by law and contract to be the exclusive provider of international voice and date services in guyana 
although we believe that we would be entitled to damages for any involuntary termination of that license  we cannot guarantee that we would prevail in any court or arbitration proceeding 
we are highly dependent on gt t for a majority of our revenues and profits 
for the year ended december  approximately of our consolidated revenue and approximately of our consolidated net income  respectively  were generated by gt t 
as of december   we have invested approximately million in guyanese telecommunications infrastructure 
our international long distance revenues have accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue in a loss of exclusivity on international voice and data services would result in a reduction in the international call traffic that we handle and could also result in a decline in international calling rates and termination fees 
any modification  early termination or other revocation of the exclusive domestic fixed and international voice and data license could adversely affect a majority of our revenues and profits and diminish the value of our investment in guyana 
see risk factors our exclusive license to provide local exchange and long distance telephone services in guyana is subject to significant political and regulatory risk 
gt t also faced an increased competitive environment for wireless services in guyana during digicel s entry into the guyana wireless market in november through acquisition has significantly increased the competition we face in the guyana wireless market 
since this entry  digicel has used aggressive operational and capital spending to gain market share  including promotional pricing  the use of extensive give aways and handset subsidies 
in turn  we countered with our own promotions and accelerated the timing of some of our capital expenditures on network expansion and upgrades 
we believe that network coverage and quality of service at competitive prices are some of the most important bases on which we compete this heightened competition has resulted in higher marketing expense and a decline in market share 
during  we also completed the migration of subscribers from our tdma network to our gsm network  which allows us to offer richer handset features and certain wireless data services  while increasing our network capacity 
commnet transaction 
in december commnet completed the sale of base stations  along with spectrum licenses  in two midwestern states for total consideration of approximately million and a pre tax gain of million 
at the same time  commnet entered into an agreement with this carrier to purchase spectrum  lease additional spectrum and build a network in rural areas in three other states 
when complete  this new network is expected to consist of at least base stations  and  in return for a long term roaming agreement with this carrier  commnet committed to complete the new network build by march  the agreement also provides the carrier with a purchase option on the new base stations exercisable beginning in through at a predetermined price each year 
the purchase price consideration reduces each option year and was determined based on estimates of what would be needed to provide a reasonable return on our investment and is intended to be reflective of the then fair value of the base stations 
while we anticipate continued overall growth from our domestic rural wireless network over the long term  this sale represented approximately of commnet s revenue and thus  we expect that the net effect of these two transactions in the short term will negatively impact commnet s revenue growth due to lower expected traffic at the new sites 
the extent of this effect depends on the pace of the new network build and ramp up of traffic on those sites 
bdc 
we have had extensive discussions with bdc s founder  chief executive officer and second largest stockholder and believe we have an agreement in principle regarding an alternative to bdc exercising its rights to repurchase our interests 
this alternative involves bdc conducting a redemption or repurchase of a portion of the equity held by shareholders other than atlantic tele network 
such a redemption or repurchase transaction would be subject to definitive documentation  the approval of bdc s board of directors and its stockholders and the ability of bdc to obtain financing and governmental approval 
if this transaction is completed  our ownership interest in bdc would increase above and bdc s financial results would be consolidated with our financial results

wireless revenue includes wholesale voice and data roaming revenue from our rural us operations and retail wireless revenues generated in guyana  including airtime and activation fees 
wireless revenue increased to million for from million for  an increase of million  or 
growth in our rural us business was responsible for million of this increase due primarily to continued deployment of additional gsm and cdma wireless base stations 
net of the sale of base stations in december of  we have deployed a total of base stations as of december  as compared to base stations as of december  of the total base stations as of december   were gsm and cdma base stations as compared to gsm and cdma base stations as of december  our rural wireless revenue also increased as a result of growth in voice and data traffic minutes and megabytes at existing sites  growth in data roaming revenue and growth in international roaming revenue 
overall  we expect our us wireless revenue growth to slow considerably in as compared to prior years as a result of the sale of base stations in december the remaining increase in wireless revenue was attributable to the continued growth of our wireless subscriber base in guyana and certain non recurring events such as guyana s hosting of cricket world cup matches and the rio group summit 
our wireless subscribers in guyana increased by  or  from  subscribers to  subscribers as of december  and  respectively 
such increase in subscribers was aided by the company s increased sales and marketing efforts  including handset promotions 
gt t s wireless revenue was million and million for and  respectively 
while we experienced growth in wireless revenue  subscribers and wireless minutes in guyana  we have also experienced a significant decline in average revenue per user arpu 
we attribute the reduction in arpu to i a reduction in retail rates  ii increased penetration into a lower usage demographic and iii pre paid customers holding handsets subscribed both to our and our competitor s network 
all of gt t s  wireless subscribers were gsm gprs subscribers as of december  as compared to  as of december  however  gains by our competitor and  we believe  a slowdown in overall wireless penetration  led to a decline in our wireless subscribers and revenue between the third and fourth quarter of while this wireless revenue may grow in due to the network expansions and subscriber additions in  competitive pressures are likely to limit that growth and may even cause a decline 
our wireless competitor in guyana has invested significant sums in expanding the service offerings and network capability of its network 
this competitor has also launched many promotional pricing plans and extensive handset subsidies  and we expect those activities to continue throughout the coming year 
in turn  we may continue and expand upon our promotions 
local telephone and data revenue 
local telephone and data revenue is generated by our wireline operations in guyana  our integrated voice and data operations in new england  and our data services in the us virgin islands 
this revenue includes basic service fees  measured service revenue  and internet access fees  as well as installation charges for new lines  monthly line rental charges  long distance or toll charges excluding international long distance charges in guyana  maintenance and equipment sales 
local telephone and data revenue increased by million  or  to million for from million for of the million increase  million derives from the inclusion of a full year of results for sovernet  our vermont based voice and data provider which was acquired in february while sovernet continues to add business customers for its voice and data services  it is being negatively impacted by the decline in its residential data business  particularly its dial up internet services 
the remaining increase of million primarily is attributable to growth in gt t s access lines in guyana from approximately  lines as of december  to approximately  lines as of december  an increase of  growth in broadband data customers in guyana  and continued strong growth in wireless broadband and dedicated access customers in the us virgin islands 
we anticipate that local telephone and data revenue will increase modestly as a result of network and subscriber and access line growth in guyana  the us virgin islands and new england 
international long distance revenue 
international long distance revenue is generated by international telephone calls into and out of guyana and does not include international long distance revenue generated by our other operations 
inbound traffic  which made up of all international long distance traffic and more than three quarters of international long distance revenue for the year ended december   is settled in us dollars 
international long distance revenue increased by million  or  from million for to million for this increase was primarily driven by continued expansion of our wireline network and increased traffic as well as a substantial growth in wireless subscribers within guyana for both gt t and its competitor  which uses gt t s international network and the impact of certain non recurring events such as guyana s hosting of cricket world cup matches and the rio group summit 
the outcome of negotiations with the government of guyana regarding the exclusivity terms of gt t s license is likely to negatively impact this revenue in the future 
we are also subject to illegal bypass via internet calling and compete against alternative and cheaper media for communication  such as e mail and text messaging 
these other modes of communication may cause a decline in both voice traffic and in international long distance revenues in future periods  although we may see a slight increase in traffic and revenues if we are effective in combating illegal bypass 
other revenue 
other revenue represents revenue from wireless digital television services in the us virgin islands  which increased to million for from million for the increase in television services was a result of higher prices for our services and a increase in television subscribers including additional hotel rooms 
our growth in revenue from our wireless digital television services is expected to slow in the future as a result of minimal anticipated future subscriber and market share growth within our currently existing geographic footprint 
termination and access fee expenses 
termination and access fee expenses are charges that we pay for voice and data transport circuits in particular  the circuits between our rural wireless sites and our switches  internet capacity and other access fees we pay to terminate our outbound toll and international calls 
termination and access fees increased by million  or  from million to million from to  respectively 
this increase was due to a full year of operations of sovernet and increased traffic growth at gt t and commnet 
in addition  an outage of the americas ii submarine fiber optic cable in may  which guyana and its neighboring countries rely on as their primary international telecommunications connection  caused gt t to temporarily re route international traffic over more costly high capacity satellite links and then to increase its standby satellite capacity 
termination expenses and access fees are expected to increase as we continue to expand our rural us wireless operations and our integrated voice and data operations in new england and as a result of gt t s expansion of its satellite capacity 
internet and programming expenses 
internet and programming expenses include digital television programming costs as well as internet connectivity charges 
internet and programming expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily from reduced expenses in the us virgin islands offset by growth in our television and broadband data subscribers 
beginning in december  we were able to significantly reduce the internet capacity expenses for our us virgin island operations 
engineering and operations expenses 
engineering and operations expenses include the expenses associated with developing  operating  supporting and expanding our networks  including the salaries and benefits paid for employees directly involved in the development and operation of our networks 
engineering and operations expenses increased by million  or  from million to million for to  respectively 
this increase is primarily the result of the expansion of our wireless networks in the united states and guyana 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales  marketing and customer service expenses include salaries and benefits we pay for sales personnel  customer service expenses  sales commissions and the costs associated with the development and implementation of our promotion and marketing campaigns 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million  or  from million to million from to  respectively 
substantially all of the increase is attributable to higher sales and marketing expenditures at gt t in order to address intensifying wireless competition in guyana 
such sales and marketing expenditures include the costs of wireless handset promotions  increased advertising and higher sales commissions 
we expect these expenses  particularly handset promotions  to fluctuate in upcoming quarters 
we expect to continue to be aggressive in gt t s marketing activities to defend our market share and to encourage use of our services 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include salaries  benefits and related costs for general corporate functions  including executive management  finance and administration  legal and regulatory  facilities  information technology and human resources 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million to million from to  respectively 
this increase is primarily attributable to a full year of operations at sovernet and additional compensation and overhead costs to support our growth 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods if our revenues continue to grow 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses represent the depreciation and amortization charges we record on our property and equipment and on our intangible assets 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million  or  from million to million for and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the addition of fixed assets at gt t and commnet 
we expect that depreciation and amortization expenses will increase in the near term because of continued capital expenditures needed to expand our networks while being partially offset by a decrease in depreciation expense at choice as a result of the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of as noted below 
impairment of long lived assets 
in the fourth quarter of  choice communications recorded a million asset impairment charge related to the wireless digital television portion of the business 
in late  choice was denied certain tax benefits by the us virgin islands government 
this denial of tax benefits  together with minimal anticipated future television subscriber and market share growth within its existing geographic footprint  resulted in the estimated future cash flows associated with this business being below the carrying value of the assets 
the company  through a separate impairment test  determined that no impairment existed as of december  relating to choice s internet services  including both the broadband data and dial up products 
gain on disposition of long lived assets 
in december  commnet sold  to a national carrier  base stations along with spectrum licenses in two midwestern states and recorded a gain on the sale of million 
also  during the first half of  commnet sold telecom assets  predominantly in western states  and recognized a gain on the sale of such assets of million 
these gains were offset by a loss of million as a result of the company s sale of all of its assets in haiti in august interest expense 
interest expense represents interest incurred on our outstanding debt including our million term loan as well as the outstanding amounts under our million revolving line of credit facility 
interest expense decreased from million for to million for this decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in the average outstanding balance under our loan facility during as compared to when we used borrowings from the revolving line of credit to help fund certain acquisitions 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the underwritten public offering of our common stock in july to repay those borrowings and had no outstanding borrowings under the revolving line of credit during the decrease in interest expense was also due to a lower effective interest rate during interest income 
interest income represents interest earned on our cash and cash equivalent balances 
interest income increased from million to million for and  respectively  due to an overall increase in our cash balances as a result of our operating results and the underwritten public offering of our common stock in july other income expense 
other income expense represents miscellaneous non operational income we earned  or expenses we incurred  including management fees received from bdc and other unconsolidated affiliates 
other income expense increased million from million in to million in the majority of the increase was a result of a license settlement for million received by commnet 
income taxes 
income taxes represent taxes we pay on our net taxable income 
the effective tax rate was and for and  respectively  which represents the statutory us income tax rate plus the guyanese income taxes in excess of the statutory us income tax rates as well as certain us state income taxes 
the effective tax rate is also impacted by the amortization of a deferred tax asset  relating to differences between the book and tax basis of fixed assets  which was recorded in a prior year 
our higher effective tax rate for the period reflects the fact that our losses in the us virgin islands were not available to reduce taxable income in guyana  which has a high tax rate of 
the reduction in our effective rate in is also a result of the impact of additional taxable income at us statutory rates and the ability to use certain tax credits during the fourth quarter of further reductions in our effective tax rate may occur over time if we are able to continue reducing losses in the us virgin islands and grow taxable income at our newer us operations 
consolidation of the results of bdc  if we were to acquire control  would also reduce this tax rate 
on january   the company adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin requires that the company recognize the impact of a tax position in the company s financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the adoption did not have a material impact on the results of operations or financial position of the company 
minority interests 
for  minority interests consisted of the guyana government s interest in gt t  a minority shareholder s interest in sovernet and other minority shareholders interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries of commnet 
for  minority interests also included a minority shareholder s interest in commnet which we acquired on january  minority interest remained constant at million for and as the increase in commnet s net income from to was offset by the decrease in the minority shareholder s equity interest in commnet 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates includes our share of the earnings of bdc  our wireless affiliate in bermuda  as well as our share of the earnings of commnet s unconsolidated affiliates 
the decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates from million to million for and  respectively  was due to a decrease in the net earnings of bdc as a result of bdc s loss of market share 
increased competition resulted in a decrease in subscribers  largely from its smaller pre paid subscriber base  as well as increased marketing and handset expenses incurred 
wireless subscribers in bermuda were  and  as of and  respectively 
net income 
as a result of the above factors  net income increased by million or from million for to million for on a per share basis  net income increased from per basic and per diluted share for to per basic and per diluted share for segment results 
we have four operating segments  which we manage and evaluate separately integrated telephony international  integrated telephony domestic  wireless television and data  and rural wireless 
segment results should be read in conjunction with note industry segments to the consolidated financial statements included in this report

we acquired commnet on september  and sovernet on february  wireless revenue 
wireless revenue increased to million for from million for  an increase of million  or 
our rural us business  which was acquired in september  was responsible for million of this increase 
this business s contribution to revenue also increased throughout the year  due primarily to our acquisitions and continued deployment of additional gsm and cdma wireless base stations  with a total of base stations deployed as of december  as compared to base stations as of december  
our rural wireless revenue also increased as a result of growth in voice and data traffic at existing sites and new international roaming revenue 
the remaining increase in wireless revenue was attributable to the continued growth of our wireless subscriber base in guyana 
the number of our wireless subscribers in guyana increased by  subscribers  or  from  subscribers to  subscribers as of december  and  respectively 
gt t s wireless revenue was million and million for and  respectively 
while we experienced wireless revenue growth in guyana  revenue growth trailed subscriber growth as wireless arpu average revenue per user has continued to decline 
we believe this decline in arpu reflects a number of factors  including the penetration of the wireless product into a lower usage demographic and our belief that some portion of the subscriber growth was a result of some new gsm customers retaining their old tdma handsets and accounts for the time being 
however  the portion of our pre paid subscribers with tdma handsets declined substantially in  particularly in the fourth quarter  in large part due to aggressive promotions aimed at converting those subscribers to our gsm services 
approximately  of gt t s wireless subscribers were gsm gprs subscribers as of december  as compared to  as of december  local telephone and data revenue 
local telephone and data revenue increased by million  or  to million for from million for sovernet  our vermont based voice and data provider  which was acquired in february  contributed million of this increase 
the remaining increase of million is primarily attributable to growth in gt t s access lines in guyana from approximately  lines as of december  to approximately  lines as of december  an increase of  growth in broadband data customers in guyana and continued strong growth in wireless broadband customers in the us virgin islands 
international long distance revenue 
international long distance revenue is generated by international telephone calls into and out of guyana and does not include international long distance revenue generated by our us businesses 
inbound traffic  which made up of all international long distance traffic and more than three quarters of international long distance revenue for the year ended december   is settled in us dollars 
international long distance revenue increased by million  or  from million for to million for the increase was primarily the result of an increase in inbound traffic or minutes of use  offset by a decline in outbound international calls originating in guyana traffic 
other revenue 
other revenue represents revenue from digital television services in the us virgin islands  which increased to million for from million for the increase in television services was a result of a increase in television subscribers  including additional hotel rooms 
the increase also reflects a price increase in february termination and access fee expenses 
termination and access fees increased by million  or  from million to million from to  respectively 
net of the addition of commnet s and sovernet s combined expenses of million for  our termination and access fees decreased by million from to because of lower long distance expenses in guyana and the cessation of operations at our atlantic tele center subsidiary 
internet and programming expenses 
internet and programming expenses increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily from the addition of our vermont operations and the growth in our television and broadband data subscribers in the us virgin islands 
engineering and operations expenses 
engineering and operations expenses increased by million  or  from million to million for to  respectively 
this increase is the result of the addition of our recently acquired businesses which together accounted for additional engineering and operations expenses of approximately million during net of our recently acquired businesses  engineering and operations expenses were down slightly  mostly due to cost reduction efforts in the us virgin islands 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased by million  or  from million to million from to  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses is the result of the addition of our vermont operations  which added million of expenses during  as well as additional costs needed to provide customer service to our larger subscriber bases and additional costs in guyana to market our wireless services 
in guyana  marketing expenses  particularly handset subsidies  rose significantly in the fourth quarter as a result of increased competition 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million to million from to  respectively 
this increase is primarily attributable to the addition of our recently acquired businesses which added million of additional overhead expenses during without these new operations  our general and administrative expenses increased by million  which is primarily attributable to an increase in accounting and professional fees relating  in part  to our obligation to be in compliance with the internal controls requirements of sarbanes oxley  as well as an increase in non cash equity based compensation and additional compensation and overhead costs to support our growth 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million  or  from million to million for and  respectively 
the increase is primarily due to the addition of fixed assets from our recent acquisitions as well as the amortization of intangible assets at sovernet 
interest expense 
interest expense increased from million for to million for this increase is primarily the result of increased borrowings used to help fund our recent acquisitions 
we used a portion of the proceeds from the underwritten public offering of our common stock in july to repay the borrowings under the line of credit 
as such there were no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit as of december  interest income 
interest income increased from million to million for and  respectively  due to an overall increase in our cash balances as result of the stock offering 
other income expense 
other income expense improved from an expense in of million to income of million in this was due primarily to the negative impact in of an increase in the reserve for our advances to bridge international communications 
income taxes 
the effective tax rate was and for and  respectively  which represents the statutory us income tax rate plus the guyanese income taxes in excess of the statutory us income tax rates as well as certain us state income taxes 
the effective tax rate is also impacted by the amortization of a deferred tax asset  relating to differences between the book and tax basis of fixed assets  which was recorded in a prior period 
our higher effective tax rate for the period reflects the fact that our losses in the us virgin islands and some of the curtailed businesses were not available to reduce taxable income in guyana  which has a high tax rate of 
the reduction in our effective rate in is a result of the impact of additional taxable income at us statutory rates  and an adjustment relating to our accrual for taxes  which were filed in minority interests 
minority interests consists of the guyana government s interest in gt t  a minority shareholder s interest in commnet  other minority shareholders interests in certain consolidated subsidiaries of commnet and a minority shareholder s interest in sovernet 
minority interest increased from million to million for and  respectively  due to an increase in net income at gt t as well as the addition of commnet and sovernet which were acquired in september and february  respectively 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates 
the decrease in equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates from million to million for and  respectively  was primarily due to increased competition in bermuda resulting in a decrease in subscribers as well as increased marketing and handset expenses incurred in response to this increased competition 
wireless subscribers in bermuda were  and  as of and  respectively 
net income 
as a result of the above factors  net income increased by million or from million for to million for on a per share basis  net income increased from per basic and per diluted share to per basic and per diluted share net income in was adversely impacted by the million reserve taken against our advances to bridge international communications 
excluding the impact of this reserve  net income would have increased by million from to regulatory and tax issues we are involved in a number of regulatory and tax proceedings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
a material and adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and future operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have met our operational liquidity needs through a combination of cash on hand and internally generated funds and have funded capital expenditures and acquisitions with a combination of internally generated funds  cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility 
uses of cash capital expenditures 
a significant use of our cash has been for capital expenditures to expand and upgrade our networks 
in  we spent approximately million for capital expenditures  including million to purchase spectrum licenses and switching and cell site equipment required to expand the geographic coverage and technical capabilities of commnet s wireless network 
at commnet  we added gsm and cdma base stations  data capabilities in many markets and enhanced microwave relay capabilities 
in addition  approximately million was incurred expanding the capacity and coverage of our wireline and wireless networks in guyana 
as of december   we had invested approximately million in the guyanese telecommunications infrastructure alone 
we are continuing to invest in expanding our networks in guyana  commnet and sovernet and expect to incur total capital expenditures between million and million in  with more than half of this amount made in connection with commnet s continued network expansion and most of the remaining balance invested in guyana 
acquisitions 
we funded our acquisitions of commnet in and sovernet in including subsequent acquisitions made by commnet with a combination of cash on hand and borrowings under our million credit facility  which was established in september we continue to explore opportunities to acquire communications properties or licenses in the caribbean  the united states and elsewhere 
such acquisitions may require external financing 
while there can be no assurance as to whether  when or on what terms we will be able to acquire any such businesses or licenses  such acquisitions may be accomplished through the issuance of shares  payment of cash or incurrence of debt 
dividends and distributions 
we use cash on hand to make dividend payments to our common stockholders when declared by our board of directors and our credit facility includes restrictions on the amount of dividends we can pay 
for the year ended december   our dividends to our stockholders approximated million which reflects dividends paid on april   july  and october  and declared in december 
we have paid quarterly dividends for the last fiscal quarters 
in addition  to the extent that we have our less than wholly owned subsidiaries pay dividends to us  we are obligated to have those subsidiaries make proportional dividend payments to the minority shareholders  and have paid dividends of million to our minority shareholders for the twelve months ended december  also  our board of directors approved a million stock buyback plan in september pursuant to which we have spent to date  repurchasing common stock 
although we currently do not intend to make additional repurchases of common stock under this plan  we may act to do so in the future  depending on market conditions and our cash needs 
debt service and other contractual commitment table 
the following table discloses aggregate information about our debt and lease obligations as of december  and the periods in which payments are due contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in millions long term debt unrecognized tax benefits pension benefits operating lease obligations total sources of cash total liquidity at december  as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  an increase of million from the december  balance of million 
we believe our existing cash balances and other capital resources  including the million available under our revolving line of credit included in our credit facility and the amount we expect to realize on disposition of our marketable securities  are adequate to meet our current operating and capital needs 
cash generated by operations 
cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
while gt t has historically been the most significant of our operating subsidiaries and affiliates in terms of our liquidity  our commnet subsidiary generated million of our cash provided from operations in  a million increase over cash generated by investing activities 
during  we sold telecommunication assets  including base stations  for total net proceeds of approximately million 
of the million in proceeds  million is restricted for the purpose of acquiring new equipment 
the remaining million will also be used to fund capital expenditures 
cash generated by financing activities 
in the third quarter of  we completed the sale of million shares of common stock at per share in an underwritten public offering  consisting of the sale by us of an aggregate of million shares million shares in july and an additional million shares purchased by the underwriters as a part of their over allotment option in august and million shares by our chairman cornelius b 
prior  jr 
and related entities 
our net proceeds of this offering  which were approximately million  were used to repay a portion of our outstanding indebtedness  and will fund capital expenditures  acquisitions and or strategic investments and general corporate purposes 
we did not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders 
credit facility 
on september   atlantic tele network entered into a credit agreement with cobank  acb providing for a credit facility consisting of a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
under the term loan  repayments of principal are deferred until the maturity of the loan on october  interest on the term loan is payable on a quarterly basis at a fixed annual interest rate of 
because cobank is a cooperative financial institution  we expect to receive patronage payments annually  and at the end of the term  from cobank which reflect our portion of cobank s profits  if any 
these payments  if received  are expected to reduce our effective interest expense on the term loan 
factors affecting sources of liquidity internally generated funds 
the key factors affecting our internally generated funds are demand for our services  competition  regulatory developments  economic conditions in the markets where we operate our businesses and industry trends within the telecommunications industry

guyana us foreign currency exchange 
historically  the guyana dollar has been considerably devalued relative to the us dollar 
the current exchange rate is approximately guyana dollars to us dollar 
we use us dollars to make gt t capital expenditures  to pay certain gt t liabilities and to value our gt t assets for the purpose of making our guyanese rate of return calculation 
unfavorable changes in the guyana dollar us dollar exchange rate would reduce our purchasing power in these areas 
the continued expansion of gt t s network is dependent upon the ability of gt t to purchase equipment with us dollars 
the functional currency of gt t for accounting purposes is the us dollar 
while currently a significant portion of gt t s revenues are transacted in us dollars  this circumstance could change in the future 
as a result of the growth of gt t s local wireless and wireline operations  negotiations with the government of guyana and the exclusivity provision of our license and the general trend toward lower international settlement rates  it is likely that an increasing portion of gt t s revenues will be earned in guyanese currency 
while there are no legal restrictions on our conversion of guyanese currency into us dollars or other hard currencies  or on the expatriation of guyanese currency or foreign currency from guyana  there are risks associated with the conversion of guyanese dollars to us dollars due to limited liquidity in the guyana foreign currency markets 
this limited liquidity has not prevented us from converting guyanese currency into us dollars within a given three month period or from converting at a price that reasonably approximates the reported exchange rate 
while we believe that gt t has  and will continue to have  adequate cash flows denominated in us currency to meet its current operating and capital requirements  there can be no assurance that gt t will be able to convert its guyana currency earnings into the us currency needed to meet such obligations 
as of december   we had million of cash held in guyanese dollars 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
restrictions under credit facility 
our credit facility contains three financial tests with which atlantic tele network must comply on a consolidated basis a total leverage ratio debt to earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation amortization ebitda of to or less  a debt service coverage ratio ebitda to debt service of to or more  and an equity to assets ratio of to or more 
in addition  commnet must comply with a leverage ratio test debt of atlantic tele network and its subsidiaries  net of pledged cash  to ebitda of commnet and its subsidiaries of less than to 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility 
capital markets 
our ability to raise funds in the capital markets depends on  among other things  general economic conditions  the conditions of the telecommunications industry  our financial performance and the state of the capital markets 
in june  the securities and exchange commission declared effective a universal shelf registration statement filed by the company 
this shelf registration statement registered the potential future offerings by us  from time to time of up to an aggregate of million of our securities  consisting potentially of common stock  debt securities  and other equity and convertible securities and combinations of the foregoing 
following our july equity offering which was conducted pursuant to the shelf registration statement  we have approximately million of securities registered for potential future offerings 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our consolidated operations in any of the years through critical accounting policies we have based our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap 
we periodically evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to foreign currency  revenue recognition  valuation of accounts receivable  property  plant and equipment  long lived and intangible assets  tax related accruals and contingencies 
we base our estimates on our operating experience and on various conditions existing in the market and we believe them to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we consider these accounting estimates to be critical because changes in the assumptions or estimates we have selected have the potential of materially impacting our financial statements 
foreign currency 
from the inception of gt t s operations through december   a significant portion of gt t s cash receipts and expenditures  including a substantial majority of its capital expenditures  have been in us dollars 
accordingly  the us dollar has been gt t s functional currency and any transaction gains and losses on non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities are reflected in income 
however  as the value of the guyana dollar has remained constant at g to one us dollar since december   there have been no foreign exchange gains or losses relating to the guyana dollar since that date 
with the expansion of gt t s wireless business and the increases that gt t hopes to receive in its rates for local service  both of which are billed and paid in guyana dollars  it is possible that the guyana dollar may become gt t s functional currency in the future  in which case any future changes in the guyana dollar exchange rate may have an adverse affect on our future results 
revenue recognition 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize for a particular transaction  all of the company s subsidiaries apply the criteria established by staff accounting bulletin or sab no 
revenue recognition and defer those items that do not meet the recognition criteria 
the subsidiaries also rely on their historical evidence with each customer or carrier in estimating amounts for which revenue is recognized 
however  due to the nature and timing of carrier settlements  adjustments affecting revenue can and do occur in periods subsequent to the period when the services were provided  billed and recorded as revenue 
historically  the company s accounts receivable reserves have been sufficient to absorb any credits and bad debt write offs recorded in subsequent periods 
the company s gt t subsidiary recognizes its wireless  local telephone and data and international long distance revenues when earned  regardless of the period in which they are billed 
the company applies the appropriate rate to minutes of long distance traffic based upon the foreign carrier from which that traffic is received 
however  gt t operates in a regulated industry  therefore  its pricing is subject to regulatory commission oversight 
such oversight could result in changes to the amount it bills customers in current and future periods 
gt t charges an activation fee to new wireless subscribers in guyana and re activation fees to subscribers in guyana who allow their accounts to lapse 
the company determined that the activation fees do not represent a separate unit of accounting under emerging issues task force issue no 
accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables or eitf 
accordingly  the company s policy is to defer those fees and recognize them ratably over the estimated customer relationship period in accordance with sab no 
to date  those fees have been immaterial to both gt t s and the company s financial position and results of operations for all periods presented 
the company recognizes revenue from commnet s roaming operations and other monthly fees in the period the services are provided 
sovernet recognizes revenue from subscriptions to its internet services as the services are provided regardless of the period in which they are billed 
for wireline services  sovernet recognizes such revenue as earned 
the company recognizes revenue from subscriptions to choice s internet  television and other services monthly  as the services are provided  net of management s best estimate of uncollectible accounts and regardless of the period in which they are billed 
installation fees charged by choice to customers subscribing to cable and internet services have historically been immaterial to both choice s and the company s financial position and results of operations 
the installation fee is intended to recover a portion of the costs associated with the installation of cabling and related equipment at the customer location required for that customer to receive choice s monthly service offerings 
the company determined that choice s activation fees represent a separate unit of accounting under eitf as such  the company s policy is to recognize these fees as revenue when the services are performed 
valuation of accounts receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when assessing the ultimate realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of customers 
due to the nature and timing of carrier settlements  adjustments affecting revenue and the corresponding receivable can and do occur in periods subsequent to the period when the services were provided  billed and recorded as revenue 
historically  our accounts receivable reserves have been sufficient to absorb any credits and bad debt write offs recorded in subsequent periods 
however  the amounts we will ultimately realize upon settlement could differ in the near term from the amounts assumed in estimating these revenues and the related accounts receivable 
property  plant and equipment 
we operate in an environment where rapid changes in technology or changes in the intended use of property  plant and equipment may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change 
our fixed assets are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight line method generally between and years 
repairs and replacements of minor items of property are charged to maintenance expense as incurred 
the cost of fixed assets in service and under construction includes an allocation of indirect costs applicable to construction 
we periodically review our obligations and update our cost estimates 
if laws are enacted or circumstances change  amounts required to remediate the properties may differ significantly from the amounts reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
long lived and intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  including property and equipment  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets are less than their carrying amount 
if an asset is deemed to be impaired  the amount of the impairment loss recognized represents the excess of the asset s carrying value as compared to its estimated fair value  based on management s assumptions and projections 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that certain assets of choice communications became impaired  and as such  recorded a million impairment charge in its statement of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information on the impairment charge 
our estimates of the future cash flows attributable to our long lived assets and the fair value of our businesses involve significant uncertainty 
those estimates are based on management s assumptions of future results  growth trends and industry conditions 
if those estimates are not met  we could have additional impairment charges in the future  and the amounts may be material 
we also assess the carrying value of goodwill on an annual basis in accordance to sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the carrying value of each reporting unit  including goodwill assigned to that reporting unit  is compared to its fair value 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill  an analysis is performed to determine if an impairment charge should be recorded 
we assess the recoverability of the value of our fcc licenses using a discounted cash flow valuation method 
we believe that our fcc licenses have an indefinite life based on historical ability to renew such licenses  that such renewals may be obtained indefinitely and at little cost  and that the related technology used is not expected to be replaced in the foreseeable future 
if the value of these assets was impaired by some factor  such as an adverse change in the subsidiary s operating market  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
we test the impairment of our fcc licenses annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of fcc licenses with their carrying amount on a license by license basis 
tax related accruals 
our estimate of deferred and current income taxes and the significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and liabilities are shown in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
these reflect the assessment of actual current and future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization 
actual income tax could vary from these estimates due to future changes in tax law 
we are also subject to tax audits from various jurisdictions 
we make estimates based on the available information and consult with experts where necessary 
we believe our estimates are reasonable  however  they may change materially in the future due to new developments or interpretation 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits  audits and other claims related to lawsuits and other legal and regulatory proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of loss accruals required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
we consult with legal counsel and other experts where necessary in connection with our assessment of any contingencies 
the required accrual for any such contingency may change materially in the future due to new developments or changes in each matter 
we estimate these contingencies amount to approximately million at december   the majority of which are not recorded on our books as we do not believe that an adverse outcome is probable 
adverse developments in these matters may result in the recording of liabilities to satisfy all or a portion of these claims 
the company adopted fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on january  and has accrued million as of december  for such matters

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange sensitivity 
although a significant portion of gt t s revenues and expenditures are currently transacted in us dollars  the results of future operations nevertheless may be affected by changes in the value of the guyana dollar 
from february until early  the guyana dollar remained relatively stable at the rate of approximately to the us dollar 
in the guyana dollar declined in value to approximately to the us dollar 
it remained relatively stable at approximately that rate through from december   through december  the guyana dollar further declined in value to approximately to the us dollar and it remained relatively stable until late in the fourth quarter  the guyana dollar declined in value to approximately to the us dollar and to approximately during the first quarter of and has remained at since then 
since the first quarter of  we have not incurred any foreign exchange losses 
a substantial majority of our consolidated cash balances are kept in us dollar denominated short term investments  and gt t generally endeavors to maintain a balance between its guyana dollar cash deposits and local receivables which are denominated in guyana dollars  and its local tax and other payables which are also denominated in the guyana dollar 
under generally accepted international accounting principles  which  in our view  are statutorily applicable to the rate making process in guyana  gt t s functional currency has been the us dollar because a significant portion of gt t s revenues and expenditures have been transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  in our view  gt t is currently entitled to its agreed upon minimum return on rate base computed in us dollars on a us dollar historical cost rate base and therefore devaluations of the guyana dollar should have had no long term impact on the value of gt t s earnings in us dollars 
the guyana public utility commission has neither approved nor disapproved our position 
moreover  with the decline in international settlement rates and the increases that gt t hopes to have in local revenue  the guyana dollar may become gt t s functional currency at some time in the future 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies above 
interest rate sensitivity 
our exposure to changes in interest rates is limited and relates primarily to our investments in commercial paper since our million of long term debt at december  has a fixed interest rate throughout the life of the loan 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
at december  we had million invested in commercial paper with a maturity of days or less 
due to the high quality and short duration of these investments we do not expect that a change in interest rates would result in any material change to our investment portfolio
