executive overview the company is a leading independent distributor of financial services products primarily to high net worth individuals and growing entrepreneurial companies 
founded in  and commencing operations on january   nfp has grown internally and through acquisitions and  as of december   operates a national distribution network with over owned firms 
the company acquired  and firms in  and  respectively 
as a result of new acquisitions and the growth of previously acquired firms  total revenue has grown from million in to nearly billion of revenue in  a compound annual growth rate of over 
the company s firms earn revenue that consists primarily of commissions and fees earned from the sale of financial products and services to their clients 
the company s firms also incur commissions and fees expense and operating expense in the course of earning revenue 
nfp pays management fees to non employee principals of its firms and or certain entities they own based on the financial performance of each respective firm 
the company refers to revenue earned by the company s firms less the expenses of its firms  including management fees  as gross margin 
the company excludes amortization and depreciation from gross margin 
these amounts are separately disclosed as part of corporate and other expenses 
management uses gross margin as a measure of the performance of the firms that the company has acquired 
through acquisitions and internal growth  gross margin has grown from million in to million in the company s gross margin is offset by expenses that it incurs at the corporate level  including corporate and other expenses 
corporate and other expenses have grown from million in to million in corporate and other expenses include general and administrative expenses  which are the operating expenses of nfp s corporate headquarters and a portion of stock based compensation 
general and administrative expenses have grown from million in to million in general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue declined from in to in included in corporate and other expenses in was the expense incurred due to the buyout of a management agreement in connection with the acquisition of a management company from its former manager for cash  nfp stock and other consideration totaling million in many external factors affect the company s revenue and profitability  including economic and market conditions  legislative and regulatory developments and competition 
because many of these factors are unpredictable and generally beyond the company s control  the company s revenue and earnings will fluctuate from year to year and quarter to quarter 
the company s revenue and net income  particularly in the second half of and early  benefited from strong sales of financed life insurance products 
management believes that sales of financed life insurance products diminished in the second half of and through the first half of  which was a significant component in the decline in sales growth from prior periods 
acquisitions under nfp s typical acquisition structure  nfp acquires of the equity of businesses that distribute financial services products on terms that are relatively standard across its acquisitions 
to determine the acquisition price  nfp s management first estimates the annual operating cash flow of the business to be acquired based on current levels of revenue and expense 
for this purpose  management generally defines operating cash flow as cash revenue of the business less cash and non cash expenses  other than amortization  
table of contents depreciation and compensation to the business s owners or individuals who subsequently become principals 
management refers to this estimated annual operating cash flow as target earnings 
typically  the acquisition price is a multiple generally in a range of five to six times of a portion of the target earnings  which management refers to as base earnings 
under certain circumstances  nfp has paid multiples in excess of six times based on the unique attributes of the transaction that justify the higher value 
base earnings averaged of target earnings for all firms owned at december  in determining base earnings  management focuses on the recurring revenue of the business 
recurring revenue refers to revenue from sales previously made such as renewal commissions on insurance products  commissions and administrative fees for ongoing benefit plans and mutual fund trail commissions and fees for assets under management 
nfp enters into a management agreement with principals and or certain entities they own 
under the management agreement  the principals and or such entities are entitled to management fees consisting of all future earnings of the acquired business in excess of the base earnings up to target earnings  and a percentage of any earnings in excess of target earnings based on the ratio of base earnings to target earnings 
nfp retains a cumulative preferred position in the base earnings 
to the extent earnings of a firm in any year are less than base earnings  in the following year nfp is entitled to receive base earnings together with the prior years shortfall before any management fees are paid 
in certain recent transactions involving large institutional sellers  nfp has provided minimum guaranteed compensation to certain former employees of the seller who became principals of the acquired business 
additional purchase consideration is often paid to the former owners based on satisfying specified internal growth thresholds over the three year period following the acquisition 
substantially all of the company s acquisitions have been paid for with a combination of cash and nfp common stock  valued at its then fair market value at the time of acquisition 
nfp requires its principals to take at least of the total acquisition price in nfp common stock 
however  in transactions involving institutional sellers  the purchase price typically consists of substantially all cash 
through december   principals have taken on average approximately of the total acquisition price in nfp common stock 
the following table shows acquisition activity including sub acquisitions in the following periods for the years ended december  in thousands  except number of acquisitions closed number of acquisitions closed consideration cash common stock other a a represents capitalized costs of the acquisitions 
although management believes that nfp will continue to have opportunities to complete a similar number of acquisitions as nfp has in the past  there can be no assurance that nfp will be successful in identifying and completing acquisitions see risk factors risks relating to the company the company may be unsuccessful in acquiring suitable acquisition candidates  which could adversely affect the company s growth 
any change in the company s financial condition or in the environment of the markets in which the company operates could impact its ability to source and complete acquisitions 

table of contents revenue the company generates revenue primarily from the following sources life insurance commissions and estate planning fees 
insurance and annuity commissions paid by insurance companies are based on a percentage of the premium that the insurance company charges to the policyholder 
first year commissions are calculated as a percentage of the first twelve months premium on the policy and earned in the year that the policy is originated 
in many cases  the company s firms receive renewal commissions for a period following the first year 
some of the company s firms receive fees for the settlement of life insurance policies 
these fees are generally based on a percentage of the settlement proceeds 
the company s firms also earn fees for developing estate plans 
revenue from life insurance activities also includes amounts received by the company s life brokerage entities  including its life settlements brokerage entity  that assists non affiliated producers with the placement and sale of life insurance 
corporate and executive benefits commissions and fees 
the company s firms earn commissions on the sale of insurance policies written for benefit programs 
the commissions are paid each year as long as the client continues to use the product and maintain its broker of record relationship with the firm 
the company s firms also earn fees for the development and implementation of corporate and executive benefit programs as well as fees for the duration that these programs are administered 
asset based fees are also earned for administrative services or consulting related to certain benefits plans 
incidental to the corporate and executive benefits services provided to their customers  some of the company s firms offer property and casualty insurance brokerage and advisory services 
the company believes that these services complement the corporate and executive benefits services provided to the company s clients 
in connection with these services  the company earns commissions and fees 
financial planning and investment advisory fees and securities commissions 
the company s firms earn commissions related to the sale of securities and certain investment related insurance products  as well as fees for offering financial advice and related services 
these fees are based on a percentage of assets under management and are generally paid quarterly 
in a few cases  incentive fees are earned based on the performance of the assets under management 
some of the company s firms charge flat fees for the development of a financial plan or a flat fee annually for advising clients on asset allocation 
some of the company s firms also earn additional compensation in the form of incentive and marketing support revenue from manufacturers of financial services products  based on the volume  persistency and profitability of business generated by the company from these three sources 
incentive and marketing support revenue is recognized at the earlier of notification of a payment or when a payment is received  unless there exists historical data or other information which enable management to reasonably estimate the amount earned during the period 
these forms of payments are earned both with respect to sales by the company s owned firms and sales by nfp s affiliated third party distributors 
nfpsi  nfp s registered broker dealer and investment adviser  also earns commissions and fees on the transactions effected through it 
most principals of the company s firms  as well as many of its affiliated third party distributors  conduct securities or investment advisory business through nfpsi 
incidental to the corporate and executive benefits services provided to their customers  some of the company s firms offer property and casualty insurance brokerage and advisory services 
the company believes these services complement the corporate and executive benefits services provided to the company s clients 
the company earns commissions and fees in connection with these services 
although nfp s operating history is limited  nfp believes that its firms earn approximately to of their revenue in the first three quarters of the year and approximately to of their revenue in the fourth quarter 

table of contents expenses the following table sets forth certain expenses as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated for the years ended december  total revenue cost of services commissions and fees operating expenses management fees total cost of services excludes items shown separately below gross margin corporate and other expenses general and administrative amortization depreciation impairment of goodwill and intangible asset management agreement buyout loss gain on sale of businesses total corporate and other expenses excludes amortization and depreciation which are shown separately under corporate and other expenses

cost of services commissions and fees 
commissions and fees are typically paid to third party producers  who are producers that are affiliated with the company s firms 
commissions and fees are also paid to non affiliated producers who utilize the services of one or more of the company s life brokerage entities including the company s life settlements brokerage entities 
commissions and fees are also paid to non affiliated producers who provide referrals and specific product expertise to nfp firms 
when business is generated solely by a principal  no commission expense is incurred because principals are only paid from a share of the cash flow of the acquired firm through management fees 
however  when income is generated by a third party producer  the producer is generally paid a portion of the commission income  which is reflected as commission expense of the acquired firm 
rather than collecting the full commission and remitting a portion to a third party producer  a firm may include the third party producer on the policy application submitted to a carrier 
the carrier will  in these instances  directly pay each named producer their respective share of the commissions and fees earned 
when this occurs the firm will record only the commissions and fees it receives directly as revenue and have no commission expense 
as a result  the nfp firm will have lower revenue and commission expense and a higher gross margin percentage 
gross margin dollars will be the same 
the transactions in which a nfp firm is listed as the sole producer and pays commissions to a third party producer  versus transactions in which the carrier pays each producer directly  will cause nfp s gross margin percentage to fluctuate without affecting gross margin dollars or earnings 
in addition  nfpsi pays commissions to the company s affiliated third party distributors who transact business through nfpsi 
operating expenses 
the company s firms incur operating expenses related to maintaining individual offices  including compensating producing and non producing staff 
firm operating expenses also include the expenses of nfpsi and nfpisi  two subsidiaries that serve the company s acquired firms and through which the company s acquired firms and its third party distributors who are members of its marketing organizations access insurance and financial services products and manufacturers 
with the adoption of sfas r the company 
table of contents now records share based payments related to firm employees and firm activities to operating expenses as a component of cost of services 
previously all share based expense components for year end periods prior to december  were recorded under corporate and other expenses general and administrative expense 
management fees 
nfp pays management fees to the principals of its firms and or certain entities they own based on the financial performance of the firms they manage 
nfp typically pays a portion of the management fees monthly in advance 
once nfp receives cumulative preferred earnings base earnings from a firm  the principals and or entity the principals own will earn management fees equal to earnings above base earnings and up to target earnings 
an additional management fee is paid in respect of earnings in excess of target earnings based on the ratio of base earnings to target earnings 
for example  if base earnings equal of target earnings  nfp receives of earnings in excess of target earnings and the principals and or the entities they own receive 
a majority of the company s acquisitions have been completed with a ratio of base earnings to target earnings of 
management fees also include an accrual for certain performance based incentive amounts payable under nfp s ongoing incentive plan 
incentive amounts are paid in a combination of cash and nfp common stock 
in addition to the incentive award  nfp pays an additional cash incentive equal to of the incentive award elected to be received in nfp common stock 
this election is made subsequent to the completion of the incentive period 
for firms that began their incentive period prior to january   the principals could elect from to to be paid in nfp common stock 
no accrual is made for these additional cash incentives until the related election is made 
however  for firms beginning their incentive period on or after january  with the exception of highland firms  the principal is required to take a minimum of maximum of the incentive award in nfp common stock 
the company accrues on a current basis for these firms the additional cash incentive of the stock portion of the award based upon the principal s election on the minimum percentage required to be received in company stock 
management fees are reduced by amounts paid by the principals and or certain entities they own under the terms of the management agreement for capital expenditures  including sub acquisitions  in excess of  these amounts may be paid in full or over a mutually agreeable period of time and are recorded as a deferred reduction in management fees 
amounts recorded as a deferred reduction in management fees are amortized as a reduction in management fee expense generally over the useful life of the asset 
the ratio of management fees to gross margin before management fees is dependent on the percentage of total earnings of the company s firms capitalized by the company  the performance of the company s firms relative to base earnings and target earnings  the growth of earnings of the company s firms in the periods after their first three years following acquisition and the earnings of nfpisi  nfpsi and a small number of firms without a principal  from which no management fees are paid 
due to nfp s cumulative preferred position  if a firm produces earnings below target earnings in a given year  nfp s share of the firm s total earnings would be higher for that year 
if a firm produces earnings at or above target earnings  nfp s share of the firm s total earnings would be equal to the percentage of the earnings capitalized by nfp in the initial transaction  less any percentage due to additional management fees earned under ongoing incentive plans 
with the adoption of sfas r  effective january   the company records share based payments related to principals in management fees which are included as a component of cost of services 
previously  all shared based expense components for year end periods prior to december  were recorded under corporate and other expenses general and administrative expense 
the following table summarizes the results of operations of nfp s firms for the periods presented and uses non gaap measures 
gross margin before management fees represents the profitability of the company s business before principals receive participation in the earnings 
gross margin before management fees as a percentage of total revenue represents the base profitability of the company divided by the total revenue of the company s business 
whether or not a principal participates in the earnings of a firm is dependent on the specific characteristics and performance of that firm 
management fees  as a percentage of gross margin before management fees represents the percentage of earnings that is not retained by the company as profit  but is paid out to principals 
the company uses gross margin before management fees and gross margin before management fees as a percentage of total revenue to evaluate how the company s business is performing before giving consideration to 
table of contents a principal s participation in their firm s earnings 
this measure is the one in which the principal is compensated for their direct operating authority and control and on which the company measures the principal s performance 
management fees  as a percentage of gross margin before management fees is a measure that management uses to evaluate how much of the company s margin and margin growth is being shared with principals 
this management fee percentage is a variable  not a fixed  ratio 
management fees  as a percentage of gross margin before management fees will fluctuate based upon the aggregate mix of earnings performance by individual firms 
it is based on the percentage of the company s earnings that are in excess of target earnings based on the ratio of base earnings to target earnings  the performance relative to nfp s preferred position in the earnings and the growth of the individual firms and in the aggregate for further discussion on the acquisition model and management fee structure  see business acquisition strategy acquisition model 
management fees will be higher during periods of strong growth due to the increase in incentive accruals 
higher incentive accruals will generally be accompanied by higher firm earnings 
where firm earnings decrease  management fees and management fee percentage will be lower as incentive accruals are either reduced or eliminated 
further  since nfp retains a cumulative preferred interest in firm earnings base earnings the relative percentage of management fees decreases as firm earnings decline 
for firms that do not achieve base earnings  principals earn no management fee 
thus  a principal earns more management fees only when firm earnings grow and  conversely  principals earn less should earnings decline 
this structure provides the company with protection against earnings shortfalls through reduced management fee expense 
in this manner the interests of both principals and shareholders remain aligned 
management uses these non gaap measures to evaluate the performance of its firms and the results of the company s model 
this cannot be effectively illustrated using the corresponding gaap measures as management fees would be included in these gaap measures and produce a less meaningful measure for this evaluation 
on a firm specific basis the company uses these measures to help the company determine where to allocate corporate and other resources to assist firm principals to develop additional sources of revenue and improve their earnings performance 
the company may assist these firms in cross selling  providing new products or services  technology improvements  providing capital for sub acquisitions or coordinating internal mergers 
on a macro level the company uses these measurements to help it evaluate broad performance of products and services which  in turn  helps shape the company s acquisition policy 
in recent years the company has emphasized acquiring businesses with a higher level of recurring revenue  such as benefits businesses  and those which expand its platform capabilities 
the company also may use these measures to help it assess the level of economic ownership to retain in new acquisitions or existing firms 
finally  the company uses these measures to monitor the effectiveness of its ongoing incentive plan 

table of contents management fees were of gross margin before management fees in compared with in and in as gross margin before management fees as a percentage of total revenue has decreased  the principals percentage participation in these earnings have also declined 
although gross margin before management fees has grown each year  the management fee expense has not kept pace  primarily as the company has increased its retained interest in recent acquisitions and has had a greater share of its earnings contributed by nfpsi and nfpisi for which no management fee expense is incurred

general and administrative expense includes both cash and stock based compensation  occupancy  professional fees  travel and entertainment  technology  telecommunication  advertising and marketing  internal audit and certain corporate compliance costs 
prior to the adoption of sfas r on january   all stock based compensation was included in general and administrative expense

depreciation 
the company incurs depreciation expense related to capital assets  such as investments in technology  office furniture and equipment as well as amortization for its leasehold improvements 
depreciation expense related to the company s firms as well as nfp s corporate office is recorded within this line item 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
the firms the company acquires may not continue to perform positively after acquisition for various reasons  including legislative or regulatory changes that affect the products in which a firm specializes  the loss of key clients after acquisition  general economic factors that impact a firm in a direct way  the cultural incompatibility of an acquired firm s management team with the company and the death or disability of significant principals 
in such situations  the company may take impairment charges in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
and reduce the carrying cost of 
table of contents acquired identifiable intangible assets including book of business  management contracts  institutional customer relationships and tradename and goodwill to their respective fair values 
management reviews and evaluates the financial and operating results of the company s acquired firms on a firm by firm basis throughout the year to assess the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with these firms 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  management uses historical trends and makes projections regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the recoverably of the respective assets 
if a firm s goodwill and other intangible assets do not meet the recoverability test  the firm s carrying value will be compared to its estimated fair value 
the fair value is based upon the amount at which the acquired firm could be bought or sold in a current transaction between nfp and the principals and or the present value of the assets future cash flows 
the intangible assets associated with a particular firm may be impaired when the firm has experienced a significant deterioration in its business indicated by an inability to produce at the level of base earnings for a period of more than four consecutive quarters and when the firm does not appear likely to improve its operating results or cash flows in the foreseeable future 
management believes that this is an appropriate time period to evaluate firm performance given the seasonal nature of many firms activities 
management agreement buyout 
from time to time  nfp may seek to acquire an additional economic interest in one of its existing firms through the acquisition of a principals ownership interest in a management company which has been contracted by nfp to manage and operate one of its wholly owned subsidiaries 
the acquisition of this ownership interest will be treated for accounting purposes as the settlement of an executory contract in a business combination between parties with a preexisting relationship and expensed as part of corporate and other expenses 
gain loss on sale of businesses 
from time to time  nfp has disposed of acquired firms or certain assets of acquired firms 
in these dispositions  nfp may realize a gain or loss on the sale of acquired firms or certain assets of acquired firms 
results of operations through acquisitions and internal growth  the company has achieved revenue growth of  and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
this growth was driven  in and  by the company s acquisitions and in previous years through a combination of acquisitions and internal growth in the revenue of its acquired firms  augmented by the growth of nfpisi and nfpsi 
in  and  the company s firms had an internal revenue growth rate of less than  and  respectively 
as a measure of financial performance  nfp calculates the internal growth rate of the revenue of the company s firms 
this calculation compares the change in revenue of a comparable group of firms for the same time period in successive years 
nfp includes firms in this calculation at the beginning of the first fiscal quarter that begins one year after acquisition by the company unless a firm has internally consolidated with another owned firm or has made a sub acquisition that represents more than of the base earnings of the acquiring firm 
with respect to two owned firms that internally consolidate  the combined firm is excluded from the calculation from the time of the internal consolidation until the first fiscal quarter that begins one year after acquisition by nfp of the most recently acquired firm participating in the internal consolidation 
however  if both firms involved in an internal consolidation are included in the internal growth rate calculation at the time of the internal consolidation  the combined firm continues to be included in the calculation after the internal consolidation 
with respect to the sub acquisitions described above  to the extent the sub acquired firm does not separately report financial statements to nfp  the acquiring firm is excluded from the calculation from the time of the sub acquisition until the first fiscal quarter beginning one year following the sub acquisition 
sub acquisitions that represent less than of the base earnings of the acquiring firms are considered to be internal growth 
for further information about sub acquisitions  see business acquisition strategy sub acquisitions 
with respect to dispositions  nfp includes these firms up to the time of disposition and excludes these firms for all periods after the disposition 
the calculation is adjusted for intercompany transactions for all periods after december  management believes that the intercompany adjustments made to the internal revenue growth rate for periods after december  does not significantly impact its comparability with prior year periods 

table of contents management also monitors acquired firm revenue  commissions and fees expense and operating expense from new acquisitions as compared with existing firms 
for this purpose  a firm is considered to be a new acquisition for the twelve months following the acquisition 
after the first twelve months  a firm is considered to be an existing firm 
within any reported period  a firm may be considered to be a new acquisition for part of the period and an existing firm for the remainder of the period 
additionally  nfpsi and nfpisi are considered to be existing firms 
a sub acquisition involves the acquisition by one of the company s firms of a business that is too small to qualify for a direct acquisition by nfp  where the individual running the business wishes to exit immediately or soon after the acquisition  prefers to partner with an existing principal  or does not wish to become a principal 
the acquisition multiple paid for sub acquisitions is typically lower than the multiple paid for a direct acquisition by nfp 
sub acquisitions that do not separately report their results are considered to be part of the firm making the acquisition  and the results of firms disposed of are included in the calculations

 long lived assets  such as purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company generally performs its recoverability test on a quarterly basis for each of its acquired firms that have experienced a significant deterioration in its business indicated principally by an inability to produce at the level of base earnings for the current and preceding four consecutive quarters 
management believes this is an appropriate time period to evaluate firm performance 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and by the eventual disposition of the asset 
if the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the underlying asset  an impairment may exist 
the company measures impairments on identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization by comparing a discounted cash flow to the carrying amount of the asset 
in the event that the discounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount  an impairment charge will be recognized for the difference in the consolidated statements of income 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested at least annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the intangible asset might be impaired 
the company generally performs its impairment test on a quarterly basis 
in connection with its quarterly evaluation  management proactively looks for indicators of impairment 
indicators include  but are not limited to sustained operating losses or a trend of poor operating performance  loss of key personnel  and an expectation that a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
the company measures impairments of goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization by comparing a discounted cash flow to the carrying amount of the asset 
in the event that the discounted cash flow is less than the carrying amount  an impairment charge will be recognized for the difference in the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents management uses certain assumptions in its discounted cash flow analysis to determine the asset s fair value 
these assumptions include but are not limited to the useful life of the asset  the discount rate from a treasury note that most closely matches the useful life of the asset  cash flow trends from prior periods  current period cash flows  and management s expectations of future cash flow expectations based on projections or forecasts derived from its understanding of the relevant business prospects  economic or market trends and regulatory or legislative changes which may occur

in accordance with sfas no 
 the company recognized an impairment loss on identifiable intangible assets subject to amortization of million  million and million for the years ended as of december   and  respectively 
in most cases  the impaired assets were the result of management adjusting downward the projected future cash flows previously expected to be received over the remaining life of the asset 
in addition  management may re evaluate and reduce the asset s useful life 
future cash flow projections  forecasts  and the assets useful lives are evaluated each quarter and may be modified based on certain facts and circumstances that come to management s attention  including  but not limited to legislation impacting a particular product or service  loss of key personnel  inability to implement a business strategy  poor performance of investment products and or services  the inability to facilitate succession planning  and levels of recurring income 
the method to compute the amount of impairment incorporates quantitative data and qualitative criteria including new information that can dramatically change the decision about the valuation of an intangible asset in a very short period of time 
the timing and amount of realized losses reported in earnings could vary if management s conclusions were different 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that its remaining goodwill and other intangibles are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on the company s reported financial position and results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period 
revenue recognition insurance and annuity commissions paid by insurance companies are based on a percentage of the premium that the insurance company charges to the policyholder 
first year commissions are calculated as a percentage of the first twelve months premium on the policy and earned in the year that the policy is originated 
in many cases  the company receives renewal commissions for a period following the first year  if the policy remains in force 
certain of the company s firms also receive fees for the settlement of life insurance policies 
these fees are generally based on a percentage of the settlement proceeds received by their clients  and recognized as revenue when the policy is transferred and the rescission period has ended 
the company also earns commissions on the sale of insurance policies written for benefit programs 
the commissions are paid each year as long as the client continues to use the product and maintain its broker of record relationship with the company

new accounting pronouncements in  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement  which provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which entities measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
under sfas  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts business 
sfas clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  the standard establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  the reporting entity s own data 
fair value measurements are required to be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 

table of contents sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and for all interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas will have  if any  on the disclosures made in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company is also in the process of evaluating the impact of sfas on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the objective of sfas is to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
different measurement attributes have been required under gaap for different assets and liabilities that can create artificial volatility in earnings 
sfas helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to report related assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
sfas also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
sfas does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in sfas and sfas  disclosures about fair value of financial instruments

the primary requirements of sfas r are as follows upon initially obtaining control  the acquiring entity in a business combination must recognize of the fair values of the acquired assets  including goodwill  and assumed liabilities  with only limited exceptions even if the acquirer has not acquired of its target 
as a consequence  the current step acquisition model will be eliminated 
contingent consideration arrangements will be fair valued at the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration 
the concept of recognizing contingent consideration at a later date when the amount of that consideration is determinable beyond a reasonable doubt  will no longer be applicable 
all transaction costs will be expensed as incurred 
sfas r is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year beginning after december  adoption is prospective and early adoption is not permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas r will have on its consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas  which is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
the effective date of this statement is the same as that of the related sfas r discussed above 
sfas requires that entities provide sufficient 
table of contents disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interest of the noncontrolling owners separately within the consolidated statement of financial position within equity  but separate from the parent s equity and separately on the face of the consolidated statement of income 
further  changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary should be accounted for consistently and when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary should be initially measured at fair value 
management is currently evaluating the effect  if any  of sfas on the company s consolidated financial statements
