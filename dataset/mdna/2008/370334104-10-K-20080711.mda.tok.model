item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we are a global consumer foods company 
we develop distinctive food products and market these value added products under unique brand names 
we work continuously to improve our established brands and to create new products that meet consumers evolving needs and preferences 
in addition  we build the equity of our brands over time with strong consumer directed marketing and innovative merchandising 
we believe our brand building strategy is the key to winning and sustaining leading share positions in markets around the globe 
our fundamental business goal is to generate superior returns for our stockholders over the long term 
we believe that increases in net sales  segment operating profits  earnings per share eps  and return on average total capital are the key measures of financial performance for our businesses 
see the non gaap measures section below for our discussion of segment operating profit and return on average total capital  which are not defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
our objectives are to consistently deliver low single digit annual growth in net sales  mid single digit annual growth in total segment operating profit  high single digit annual growth in eps  and on average  at least a basis point annual increase in return on average total capital 
we believe that this financial performance  coupled with an attractive dividend yield  should result in long term value creation for stockholders 
we also return a substantial amount of cash annually to stockholders through share repurchases 
for the fiscal year ended may   our net sales grew percent  total segment operating profit grew percent  diluted eps grew percent  and our return on average total capital improved by basis points 
these results met or exceeded our long term targets 
diluted eps for fiscal includes a net gain from mark to market valuation of certain commodity positions and a benefit associated with a favorable court decision on a discrete tax matter 
net cash provided by operations totaled billion in fiscal  enabling us to increase our annual dividend payments per share by percent from fiscal and continue returning cash to stockholders through share repurchases  which totaled  million in fiscal we also made significant capital investments totaling million in fiscal  an increase of percent from fiscal  to support future growth and productivity 
we achieved each of our four key operating objectives for fiscal we generated broad based growth in net sales across our businesses 
all of our us retail divisions  international geographic regions  and bakeries and foodservice customer segments posted net sales gains in fiscal we generated points of growth from volume  generated points of growth from net price realization and product mix  and realized points of foreign currency exchange benefit 
our cost savings initiatives helped to partially offset input cost inflation in fiscal we took steps to manage raw material costs  especially with significant commodity price increases in fiscal  and we initiated several restructuring actions to rationalize and simplify our product portfolio  allowing us to focus on higher margin products 
we invested a significant amount in media and other brand building marketing programs  which contributed to sales growth across our businesses 
we also recorded increases in eps well above our target  even excluding the effects of non cash  mark to market gains and a discrete tax item 
details of our financial results are provided in the fiscal consolidated results of operations section below 
in fiscal  input cost inflation will remain a challenge for us 
we plan to offset a significant portion of this cost inflation with our holistic margin management hmm efforts  which include cost savings initiatives  marketing spending efficiencies  and profitable sales mix strategies 
we have also raised prices on a number of our product lines 
we believe our hmm efforts help us keep our price increases moderate and expand our margins over the long term 
in addition  our hmm savings generate resources for increased advertising and other brand building consumer marketing initiatives 
our plans call for a high single digit increase in consumer marketing support in fiscal we believe this support is a key factor in generating net sales growth  as we believe it builds consumer loyalty  increases our market share  and defends against private label offerings

our fixed charge coverage ratio in fiscal was compared to in fiscal the measure increased from fiscal as earnings before income taxes and after tax earnings from joint ventures increased by million and fixed charges decreased by million 
our operating cash flow to debt ratio decreased percent to percent in fiscal  driven by a slight decrease in cash flows from operations and an increase in our year end debt balance

in april  we contributed assets with an aggregate fair market value of billion to our subsidiary gmc 
the contributed assets consist primarily of manufacturing assets and intellectual property associated with the production and retail sale of big g cereals  progresso soups  and old el paso products in the united states 
in exchange for the contribution of these assets  gmc issued its managing membership interest and its limited preferred membership interests to certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
we continue to hold the entire managing membership interest  and therefore direct the operations of gmc 
other than the right to consent to certain actions  holders of the limited preferred membership interests do not participate in the management of gmc 
we currently hold all interests in gmc other than the class a interests 
the terms of the class a interests are described in the fifth amended and restated limited liability company agreement of gmc the llc agreement 
the holder of the class a interests receives quarterly preferred distributions from available net income based on the application of a floating preferred return rate  currently equal to the sum of three month libor plus basis points  to the holder s capital account balance established in the most recent mark to market valuation currently million 
the llc agreement requires that the preferred return rate of the class a interests be adjusted every five years through a negotiated agreement between the class a interest holder and gmc  or through a remarketing auction 
the next remarketing is scheduled to occur in june and thereafter in five year intervals 
upon a failed remarketing  the preferred return rate over three month libor will be increased by basis points until the next remarketing  which will occur in month intervals until a successful remarketing occurs or the managing member purchases the class a interests 
the managing member may at any time elect to purchase all of the class a interests for an amount equal to the holder s capital account balance as adjusted in a mark to market valuation  plus any accrued but unpaid preferred returns and the prescribed make whole amount 
holders of the class a interests may initiate a liquidation of gmc under certain circumstances  including  without limitation  the bankruptcy of gmc or its subsidiaries  gmc s failure to deliver the preferred distributions on the class a interests  gmc s failure to comply with portfolio requirements  breaches of certain covenants  lowering of our senior debt rating below either baa by moody s or bbb by s p  and a failed attempt to remarket the class a interests as a result of gmc s failure to assist in such remarketing 
in the event of a liquidation of gmc  each member of gmc will receive the amount of its then current capital account balance 
the managing member may avoid liquidation by exercising its option to purchase the class a interests 
for financial reporting purposes  the assets  liabilities  results of operations  and cash flows of gmc are included in our consolidated financial statements 
the return to the third party investor is reflected in net interest in the consolidated statements of earnings 
the third party investor s interests in gmc are classified as minority interests on our consolidated balance sheets 
as discussed above  we may exercise our option to purchase the class a interests for consideration equal to the then current capital account value  plus any unpaid preferred return and the prescribed make whole amount 
if we purchase these interests  any change in the unrelated third party investor s capital account from its original value will be charged directly to retained earnings and will increase or decrease the net earnings used to calculate eps in that period

on august   the pension protection act ppa became law in the united states 
the ppa revised the basis and methodology for determining defined benefit plan minimum funding requirements as well as maximum contributions to and benefits paid from tax qualified plans 
most of these provisions are first applicable to our domestic defined benefit pension plans in fiscal on a phased in basis 
the ppa may ultimately require us to make additional contributions to our domestic plans 
however  due to our historical funding practices and current funded status  we do not expect to have significant statutory or contractual funding requirements for our major defined benefit plans during the next several years 
no fiscal domestic plan contributions are currently expected 
actual fiscal contributions could exceed our current projections  and may be influenced by our decision to undertake discretionary funding of our benefit trusts versus other competing investment priorities  or by future changes in government requirements 
additionally  our projections concerning timing of the ppa funding requirements are subject to change and may be influenced by factors such as general market conditions affecting trust asset performance  interest rates  and our future decisions regarding certain elective provisions of the ppa 
the following table summarizes our future estimated cash payments under existing contractual obligations  including payments due by period payments due by fiscal year and in millions total thereafter long term debt a accrued interest operating leases capital leases purchase obligations b total a excludes million related to capital leases and million of bond premium and original issue discount 
b subsequent to may   we entered into sourcing contracts with contractual obligations of million in  million in  and million in principal payments due on long term debt are based on stated contractual maturities or put rights of certain note holders 
the majority of the purchase obligations represent commitments for raw material and packaging to be utilized in the normal course of business and for consumer marketing spending commitments that support our brands 
the fair value of our interest rate and equity swaps with a payable position to the counterparty was million as of may   based on fair market values as of that date 
future changes in market values will impact the amount of cash ultimately paid or received to settle those instruments in the future 
other long term obligations mainly consist of liabilities for uncertain income tax positions  accrued compensation and benefits  including the underfunded status of certain of our defined benefit pension  other postretirement benefit  and postemployment benefit plans  and miscellaneous liabilities 
we expect to pay million of benefits from our unfunded postemployment benefit plans in fiscal further information on 
table of contents all of these plans is included in note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
significant accounting estimates for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
our significant accounting estimates are those that have meaningful impact on the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations 
these estimates include our accounting for promotional expenditures  intangible assets  stock compensation  income taxes  and defined benefit pension  other postretirement and postemployment benefits 
promotional expenditures our promotional activities are conducted through our customers and directly or indirectly with end consumers 
these activities include payments to customers to perform merchandising activities on our behalf  such as advertising or in store displays  discounts to our list prices to lower retail shelf prices and payments to gain distribution of new products  coupons  contests  and other incentives  and media and advertising expenditures 
the media and advertising expenditures are recognized as expense when the advertisement airs 
the cost of payments to customers and other consumer activities are recognized as the related revenue is recorded  which generally precedes the actual cash expenditure 
the recognition of these costs requires estimation of customer participation and performance levels 
these estimates are made based on the forecasted customer sales  the timing and forecasted costs of promotional activities  and other factors 
differences between estimated expenses and actual costs are normally insignificant and are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period 
our accrued trade  coupon  and consumer marketing liabilities were million as of may   and million as of may  because our total promotional expenditures including amounts classified as a reduction of revenues are significant  if our estimates are inaccurate we would have to make adjustments that could have a material effect on our results of operations 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and disposition of the asset group are less than the carrying amount of the asset group 
asset groups have identifiable cash flows independent of other asset groups 
measurement of an impairment loss would be based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset group over its fair value 
fair value is measured using discounted cash flows or independent appraisals  as appropriate 
intangible assets goodwill is not subject to amortization and is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred 
impairment testing is performed for each of our reporting units 
we compare the carrying value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  to the fair value of the unit 
carrying value is based on the assets and liabilities associated with the operations of that reporting unit  which often requires allocation of shared or corporate items among reporting units 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we revalue all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit  excluding goodwill  to determine if the fair value of the net assets is greater than the net assets including goodwill 
if the fair value of the net assets is less than the net assets including goodwill  impairment has occurred 
our estimates of fair value are determined based on a discounted cash flow model 
growth rates for sales and profits are determined using inputs from our annual long range planning process 
we also make estimates of discount rates  perpetuity growth assumptions  market comparables  and other factors 
we evaluate the useful lives of our other intangible assets  mainly intangible assets associated with the pillsbury  totino s  progresso  green giant  old el paso  h agen dazs and uncle tobys brands  to determine if they are finite or indefinite lived 
reaching a determination on useful life requires significant judgments and assumptions regarding the future effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  other economic factors such as the stability of the industry  known technological advances  legislative action that results in an uncertain or changing regulatory environment  and expected changes in distribution channels  the level of required maintenance expenditures  and the expected lives of other related groups of assets 
our indefinite lived intangible assets  mainly brands  are also tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be 
table of contents recoverable 
we performed our fiscal assessment of our brand intangibles as of december  our estimate of the fair value of the brands was based on a discounted cash flow model using inputs which included projected revenues from our annual long range plan  assumed royalty rates that could be payable if we did not own the brands  and a discount rate 
all brand intangibles had fair values in excess of their carrying values by at least percent  except for the pillsbury brand  which we estimated had a fair value percent higher than its carrying value 
this brand comprises nearly one half of our total indefinite lived intangible assets 
if the growth rate for the global revenue from all uses of the pillsbury brand decreases basis points from the current planned growth rate  fair value would be reduced by approximately million  assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged 
if the assumed royalty rate for all uses of the pillsbury brand decreases by basis points  fair value would be reduced by approximately million  assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged 
if the applicable discount rate increases by basis points  fair value of the pillsbury brand would be reduced by approximately million  assuming all other components of the fair value estimate remain unchanged 
as of may   we reviewed each of the assumptions used in the annual impairment assessment performed as of december   and found them to still be appropriate 
as of may   we had billion of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
while we currently believe that the fair value of each intangible exceeds its carrying value and that those intangibles so classified will contribute indefinitely to our cash flows  materially different assumptions regarding future performance of our businesses could result in significant impairment losses and amortization expense 
stock compensation effective may   we adopted sfas r  which changed the accounting for compensation expense associated with stock options  restricted stock awards  and other forms of equity compensation 
we elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas r  accordingly  results from prior periods were not restated 
under this method  stock based compensation expense for fiscal was million  which included amortization related to the remaining unvested portion of all equity compensation awards granted prior to may   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and amortization related to all equity compensation awards granted on or subsequent to may   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the incremental effect on net earnings in fiscal of our adoption of sfas r was million of expense million after tax 
all our stock compensation expense is recorded in sg a expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 
prior to may   we used the intrinsic value method for measuring the cost of compensation paid in our common stock 
no compensation expense for stock options was recognized in our consolidated statements of earnings prior to fiscal  as the exercise price was equal to the market price of our stock at the date of grant 
expense attributable to other types of share based awards was recognized in our results under sfas the estimated weighted average fair values of stock options granted and the assumptions used for the black scholes option pricing model were as follows fiscal year estimated fair values of stock options granted assumptions risk free interest rate expected term years years years expected volatility dividend yield the valuation of stock options is a significant accounting estimate which requires us to use judgments and assumptions that are likely to have a material impact on our financial statements 
annually  we make predictive assumptions regarding future stock price volatility  employee exercise behavior  and dividend yield 
we estimate our future stock price volatility using the historical volatility over the expected term of the option  excluding time periods of volatility we believe a marketplace participant would exclude in estimating our stock price volatility 
for the fiscal grants  we have excluded historical volatility for fiscal and prior  primarily because volatility driven by our acquisition of the 
table of contents pillsbury company in fiscal does not reflect what we believe to be expected future volatility 
we also have considered  but did not use  implied volatility in our estimate  because trading activity in options on our stock  especially those with tenors of greater than months  is insufficient to provide a reliable measure of expected volatility 
if all other assumptions are held constant  a one percentage point increase in our fiscal volatility assumption would increase the grant date fair value of our fiscal option awards by percent 
for fiscal and all prior periods  our estimate of expected stock price volatility is based on historical volatility determined on a daily basis over the expected term of the options 
we considered but did not use implied volatility because we believed historical volatility provided an appropriate expectation for our volatility in the future 
our expected term represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding based on historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model 
separate groups of employees have similar historical exercise behavior and therefore were aggregated into a single pool for valuation purposes 
the weighted average expected term for all employee groups is presented in the table above 
an increase in the expected term by year  leaving all other assumptions constant  would change the grant date fair value by significantly less than percent 
our valuation model assumes that dividends and our share price increase in line with earnings  resulting in a constant dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate for periods during the expected term of the options is based on the us treasury zero coupon yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our assumptions  we are not required to true up grant date fair value based expense to final intrinsic values 
however  these differences can impact the classification of cash tax benefits realized upon exercise of stock options  as explained in the following two paragraphs 
furthermore  historical data has a significant bearing on our forward looking assumptions 
significant variances between actual and predicted experience could lead to prospective revisions in our assumptions  which could then significantly impact the year over year comparability of stock based compensation expense 
sfas r also provides that any corporate income tax benefit realized upon exercise or vesting of an award in excess of that previously recognized in earnings referred to as a windfall tax benefit is presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows as a financing rather than an operating cash flow 
for fiscal and fiscal  the windfall tax benefits classified as financing cash flow were million and million 
the actual impact on future years financing cash flow will depend  in part  on the volume of employee stock option exercises during a particular year and the relationship between the exercise date market value of the underlying stock and the original grant date fair value previously determined for financial reporting purposes 
realized windfall tax benefits are credited to additional paid in capital within the consolidated balance sheet 
realized shortfall tax benefits amounts which are less than that previously recognized in earnings are first offset against the cumulative balance of windfall tax benefits  if any  and then charged directly to income tax expense  potentially resulting in volatility in our consolidated effective income tax rate 
we calculated a cumulative amount of windfall tax benefits from post fiscal years for the purpose of accounting for future shortfall tax benefits and currently have sufficient cumulative windfall tax benefits to absorb projected arising shortfalls  such that we do not currently expect future earnings to be affected by this provision 
however  as employee stock option exercise behavior is not within our control  it is possible that materially different reported results could occur if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail 
income taxes we adopted the provisions of fin as of the beginning of fiscal prior to adoption  our policy was to establish reserves that reflected the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
the effects of final resolution  if any  were recognized as changes to the effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
fin requires application of a more likely than not threshold to the recognition and derecognition of uncertain tax positions 
fin permits us to recognize the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement 
it further requires that a change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change 
annually we file more than income tax returns in approximately global taxing jurisdictions 
a number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and finally resolved 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or 
table of contents the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position  we believe that our reserves for income taxes reflect the most likely outcome 
we adjust these reserves  as well as the related interest  in light of changing facts and circumstances 
settlement of any particular position would usually require the use of cash 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
our major taxing jurisdictions include the united states federal and state and canada 
we are no longer subject to united states federal examinations by the irs for fiscal years before during fiscal  we received a favorable district court decision on an uncertain tax matter related to the fiscal years prior to and reduced our liability for uncertain tax positions by million and related accrued interest by million 
the irs has appealed the district court decision  and accordingly  its ultimate resolution is subject to change 
during the fiscal  we also concluded various matters for fiscal years which included a payment of million 
the irs recently concluded field examinations for our and fiscal years 
a payment of million was made to cover the additional tax liability plus interest related to all agreed adjustments for this audit cycle 
the irs also proposed additional adjustments for the audit cycle including several adjustments to the tax benefits associated with the sale of minority interests in our gmc subsidiary 
we believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to vigorously defend our position 
our potential liability for this matter is significant and  notwithstanding our reserves against this potential liability  an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations 
we do not expect the amount of our tax reserves for these issues to materially change in the next months 
the irs initiated its audit of our fiscal through tax years during fiscal various tax examinations by united states state taxing authorities could be conducted for any open tax year  which vary by jurisdiction  but are generally from to years 
currently  several state examinations are in progress 
the canada revenue agency is conducting an audit of our income tax returns in canada for fiscal years which is our earliest tax year still open for examination through we do not anticipate that any united states state tax or canadian tax adjustments will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plans we have defined benefit pension plans covering most domestic  canadian  and united kingdom employees 
benefits for salaried employees are based on length of service and final average compensation 
benefits for hourly employees include various monthly amounts for each year of credited service 
our funding policy is consistent with the requirements of applicable laws 
we made million of voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal our principal domestic retirement plan covering salaried employees has a provision that any excess pension assets would vest if the plan is terminated within five years of a change in control 
we also sponsor plans that provide health care benefits to the majority of our domestic and canadian retirees 
the salaried health care benefit plan is contributory  with retiree contributions based on years of service 
we fund related trusts for certain employees and retirees on an annual basis 
we did not make voluntary contributions to these plans in fiscal under certain circumstances  we also provide accruable benefits to former or inactive employees in the united states  canada  and mexico  and members of our board of directors  including severance and certain other benefits payable upon death 
we recognize an obligation for any of these benefits that vest or accumulate with service 
postemployment benefits that do not vest or accumulate with service such as severance based solely on annual pay rather than years of service are charged to expense when incurred 
our postemployment benefit plans are unfunded 
we recognize benefits provided during retirement or following employment over the plan participants active working life 
accordingly  we make various assumptions to predict and measure costs and obligations many years prior to the settlement of our obligations 
assumptions that require significant management judgment and have a material impact on the measurement of our net periodic benefit expense or income and accumulated benefit obligations include the long term rates of return on plan assets  the interest rates used to discount the obligations for our benefit plans  and the health care cost trend rates 
expected rate of return on plan assets our expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by our asset allocation  our historical long term investment performance  our estimate of future long term returns by asset class using input from our 
table of contents actuaries  investment services  and investment managers  and long term inflation assumptions 
we review this assumption annually for each plan  however  our annual investment performance for one particular year does not  by itself  significantly influence our evaluation 
the investment objective for our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans is to secure the benefit obligations to participants at a reasonable cost to us 
our goal is to optimize the long term return on plan assets at a moderate level of risk 
the defined benefit pension and other postretirement portfolios are broadly diversified across asset classes 
within asset classes  the portfolios are further diversified across investment styles and investment organizations 
for the defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans  the long term investment policy allocations are percent to equities in the united states  percent to international equities  percent to private equities  percent to fixed income  and percent to real assets real estate  energy and timber 
the actual allocations to these asset classes may vary tactically around the long term policy allocations based on relative market valuations 
our historical investment returns compound annual growth rates for our united states defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan assets were percent  percent  percent  percent  and percent for the     and year periods ended may  for fiscal  we assumed  on a weighted average basis for all defined benefit plans  a rate of return of percent 
for fiscal  we assumed  on a weighted average basis for all defined benefit plans  a rate of return of percent 
for fiscal  we assumed  on a weighted average basis for all defined benefit plan assets  a rate of return of percent 
our principal defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans in the united states have an expected return on plan assets of percent 
during fiscal  we lowered the expected rate of return on one of our other postretirement plans in the united states based on costs associated with insurance contracts owned by that plan 
lowering the expected long term rate of return on assets by basis points would increase our net pension and postretirement expense by million for fiscal a basis point shortfall between the assumed and actual rate of return on plan assets for fiscal would result in a similar amount of arising asset experience loss 
any arising asset experience loss is recognized on a market related valuation basis  which reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five year period from the year in which they occur 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 
since the market related value of assets recognizes gains or losses over a five year period  the future value of assets will be impacted as previously deferred gains or losses are recorded 
our outside actuaries perform these calculations as part of our determination of annual expense or income 
discount rates our discount rate assumptions are determined annually as of the last day of our fiscal year for all of our defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plan obligations 
those same discount rates also are used to determine defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plan income and expense for the following fiscal year 
we work with our actuaries to determine the timing and amount of expected future cash outflows to plan participants and  using the top quartile of aa rated corporate bond yields  to develop a forward interest rate curve  including a margin to that index based on our credit risk 
this forward interest rate curve is applied to our expected future cash outflows to determine our discount rate assumptions 
our weighted average discount rates were as follows weighted average discount rates defined other benefit postretirement postemployment pension benefit benefit plans plans plans obligation as of may   and fiscal expense obligation as of may   and fiscal expense fiscal expense lowering the discount rates by basis points would increase our net defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plan expense for fiscal by approximately million 
all obligation related experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over the average remaining service period of active plan participants 

table of contents health care cost trend rates we review our health care trend rates annually 
our review is based on data we collect about our health care claims experience and information provided by our actuaries 
this information includes recent plan experience  plan design  overall industry experience and projections  and assumptions used by other similar organizations 
our initial health care cost trend rate is adjusted as necessary to remain consistent with this review  recent experiences  and short term expectations 
our initial health care cost trend rate assumption is percent for retirees age and over and percent for retirees under age these rates are graded down annually until the ultimate trend rate of percent is reached in for all retirees 
the trend rates are applicable for calculations only if the retirees benefits increase as a result of health care inflation 
the ultimate trend rate is adjusted annually  as necessary  to approximate the current economic view on the rate of long term inflation plus an appropriate health care cost premium 
assumed trend rates for health care costs have an important effect on the amounts reported for the other postretirement benefit plans 
a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate would have the following effects one one percentage percentage point point in millions increase decrease effect on the aggregate of the service and interest cost components in fiscal effect on the other postretirement accumulated benefit obligation as of may  any arising health care claims cost related experience gain or loss is recognized in the calculation of expected future claims 
once recognized  experience gains and losses are amortized using a straight line method over years  resulting in at least the minimum amortization required being recorded 
financial statement impact in fiscal  we recorded net defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plan expense of million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal as of may   we had cumulative unrecognized actuarial net losses of million on our defined benefit pension plans  million on our other postretirement benefit plans  and million on our postemployment benefit plans  mainly as the result of decreases in our discount rate assumptions 
these unrecognized actuarial net losses will result in decreases in our future pension income and increases in postretirement expense since they currently exceed the corridors defined by gaap 
we use the retirement plans rp mortality table projected forward to our plans measurement dates for calculating the year end defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit obligations and annual expense 
actual future net defined benefit pension  other postretirement  and postemployment benefit plan income or expense will depend on investment performance  changes in future discount rates  changes in health care trend rates  and various other factors related to the populations participating in these plans

table of contents a bargain purchase  and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r applies to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after december  sfas r also changes the accounting for acquisition related tax contingencies  requiring all such changes in these contingency reserves to be recorded in earnings after the effective date 
we have significant unrecognized tax positions related to our acquisition of pillsbury 
adjustments to these liabilities after the adoption of sfas r could be material to our net earnings

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of sfas no 
sfas 
this statement provides companies with an option to measure  at specified election dates  many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently measured at fair value 
a company that adopts sfas will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
this statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which for us is the first quarter of fiscal we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
this statement provides a single definition of fair value  a framework for measuring fair value  and expanded disclosures concerning fair value 
previously  different definitions of fair value were contained in various accounting pronouncements creating inconsistencies in measurement and disclosures 
sfas applies under those previously issued pronouncements that prescribe fair value as the relevant measure of value  except sfas r and related interpretations and pronouncements that require or permit measurement similar to fair value but are not intended to measure fair value 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which for us is the first quarter of fiscal however  sfas as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for non financial assets and liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which for us is the first quarter of fiscal we are evaluating the impact of sfas on our results of operations and financial condition

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  we actively manage our exposure to these market risks by entering into various hedging transactions  authorized under established policies that place clear controls on these activities 
the counterparties in these transactions are generally highly rated institutions 
we establish credit limits for each counterparty 
our hedging transactions include but are not limited to a variety of derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuances of fixed rate debt  and existing and future issuances of floating rate debt 
primary exposures include us treasury rates  libor  and commercial paper rates in the united states and europe 
we use interest rate swaps and forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to interest rate changes  to reduce the volatility of our financing costs  and to achieve a desired proportion of fixed versus floating rate debt  based on current and projected market conditions 
generally under these swaps  we agree with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on an agreed notional principal amount 
as of may   we had billion of aggregate notional principal amount outstanding  with a net notional amount of million that converts floating rate notes to fixed rates 
this includes notional amounts of offsetting swaps that neutralize our exposure to interest rates on other interest rate swaps 
foreign exchange risk foreign currency fluctuations affect our net investments in foreign subsidiaries and foreign currency cash flows related to third party purchases  intercompany loans  and product shipments 
we are also exposed to the translation of foreign currency earnings to the us dollar 
our principal exposures are to the australian dollar  british pound sterling  canadian dollar  chinese renminbi  euro  japanese yen  and mexican peso 
we mainly use foreign currency forward contracts to selectively hedge our foreign currency cash flow exposures 
we generally do not hedge more than months forward and generally do not hedge intercompany transactions 
we also have many net investments in foreign subsidiaries that are denominated in euros 
we hedge a portion of these net investments by issuing euro denominated commercial paper 
as of may   we had issued million of euro denominated commercial paper and foreign exchange forward contracts that we have designated as a net investment hedge and thus deferred net foreign currency transaction losses of million to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
commodity price risk many commodities we use in the production and distribution of our products are exposed to market price risks 
we utilize derivatives to hedge price risk for our principal ingredient and energy costs  including grains oats  wheat  and corn  oils principally soybean  non fat dry milk  natural gas  and diesel fuel 
we manage our exposures through a combination of purchase orders  long term contracts with suppliers  exchange traded futures and options  and over the counter options and swaps 
we offset our exposures based on current and projected market conditions  and generally seek to acquire the inputs at as close to our planned cost as possible 
as of may   the net notional value of commodity derivatives was million  of which million relates to agricultural positions and million relates to energy positions 
these hedges relate to inputs that generally will be utilized within the next months 
equity instruments equity price movements affect our compensation expense as certain investments owned by our employees related to our deferred compensation plan are revalued 
we use equity swaps to manage this market risk 
value at risk the estimates in the table below are intended to measure the maximum potential fair value we could lose in one day from adverse changes in market interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices under normal market conditions 
a monte carlo value at risk var methodology was used to quantify the market risk for our exposures 
the models assumed normal market conditions and used a percent confidence level 
the var calculation used historical interest rates  foreign exchange rates  and commodity and equity prices from the past 
table of contents year to estimate the potential volatility and correlation of these rates in the future 
the market data were drawn from the riskmetrics tm data set 
the calculations are not intended to represent actual losses in fair value that we expect to incur 
further  since the hedging instrument the derivative inversely correlates with the underlying exposure  we would expect that any loss or gain in the fair value of our derivatives would be generally offset by an increase or decrease in the fair value of the underlying exposures 
the positions included in the calculations were debt  investments  interest rate swaps  foreign exchange forwards  commodity swaps  futures and options  and equity instruments 
the calculations do not include the underlying foreign exchange and commodities related positions that are hedged by these market risk sensitive instruments 
the table below presents the estimated maximum potential var arising from a one day loss in fair value for our interest rate  foreign currency  commodity  and equity market risk sensitive instruments outstanding as of may   and may   and the average fair value impact during the year ended may  fair value impact average may  during may  in millions fiscal interest rate instruments foreign currency instruments commodity instruments equity instruments
