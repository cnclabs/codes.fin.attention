results of operations the following table illustrates the key earnings figures for each of the past three years ended april    and year ended april  percentage change in thousands  except earnings per share vs vs earnings per share net income operating income income from securities transactions  net operating revenues year ended april  percentage change operating revenues and of total by year in thousands vs vs investment periodicals and related publications licensing fees investment management fees and related services total operating revenues investment periodicals and related publications revenues the investment periodicals and related publications revenues were down  or for the twelve months ended april  as compared to the twelve months ended april  as a percentage of total operating revenues  investment periodicals and related publications revenues have decreased from at the end of fiscal year to at the end of fiscal year while the company continues to attract new subscribers through various marketing channels  primarily direct mail and the internet  total product line circulation continues to decline 
factors that have contributed to the decline in the investment periodicals and related publications revenues include the increasing amount of competition in the form of free and lower cost investment research on the internet and research provided by brokerage firms at no cost to their clients 
within investment periodicals and related publications are subscription revenues to print and electronic products 
year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs print publication revenues electronic publication revenues total investment periodicals and related publications revenue unearned revenues short and long term institutional sales increased while retail business decreased 
value line s electronic publications revenues derive from institutional accounts and from retail subscribers 
for the twelve months ended april   institutional revenues increased  or  while revenues from retail subscribers were down  or as compared to the twelve months ended april  the decrease in electronic retail publications revenues is primarily attributable to the decrease in circulation within the company s software products 
circulation of the value line investment analyzer decreased  which resulted in a  decline in revenues from this product  partially offset by an increase in the circulation and revenues from online subscriptions to the value line investment survey 
for the year ended april  print publication revenues decreased  or below last fiscal year as a result of the decrease in advertising and increased competition in the form of free and paid investment research 
licensing revenues licensing revenues have grown   and  respectively  each of the last three years ended april   and as of april   total third party sponsored assets attributable to the licensing business represent billion in various products 
the recent credit crisis  corporate action by certain closed end fund shareholders  and a broad market decline has impacted overall assets attributable to the licensing business revenues 
however  total assets are relatively unchanged from the previous year end due to the ability of third parties to raise assets to offset the market erosion on their products 
in fiscal year the company signed one new sponsor  which has significant distribution capabilities in the uit market place 
the new sponsor has tested several product related portfolio strategies and we believe will launch an etf unit investment trust in july the company believes the growth of the business is dependent upon the desire of third party marketers to use the value line trademarks and proprietary research for their products  signing new licensing agreements  and the marketplace s acceptance of new products 
as stated in the past  value line believes it was an early entrant into this new market six years ago 
today this market has significantly broadened as a result of product diversification and growth of index utilization by portfolio managers 
simultaneously  the company and its third party sponsors face greater competition in the marketplace from index providers 
investment management fees and distribution services revenues the investment management fees and distribution services revenues were up  or for the twelve months ended april  as compared to the twelve months ended april  after being down  or for the year ended april  compared to year ended april  during the period  voluntary and contractual fee waivers exist for certain of the value line funds 
for the twelve months ended april    and  b fee waivers were   and  for the twelve months ended april    and  total management fee waivers were   and  the company and its subsidiary  vls  have no right to recoup the previously waived amounts of management fees and b fees 
the table below illustrates the total fund assets for the twelve months ended april  as compared to the previous two fiscal years 
the second table shows the two channels through which the equity funds are available 
shares of value line strategic asset management trust sam and value line centurion fund are available to the public only through the purchase of certain variable annuity and variable life insurance contracts issued by the guardian insurance annuity company  inc giac 
year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs equity funds fixed income funds money market funds total net assets equity fund assets sold through giac equity fund assets sold though vls total equity fund net assets the company believes that the growth in equity fund assets for the twelve months of fiscal and growth in equity fund assets for fiscal excluding sam and centurion funds sold through giac  has been in large part due to the good performance for certain value line funds at various intervals in terms of short  mid and long term returns 
as of april   of the equity funds  excluding sam and centurion  had four or five star ratings by morningstar  inc similar to fiscal the largest distribution channel for the value line funds remains the fund supermarket platforms including  but not limited to  charles schwab co  inc  td ameritrade  inc  and national city bank 
the company s fixed income fund assets  representing of total fund assets at april   are down from the previous year end 
the decline in fixed income assets reflects the challenge of competing against equity funds and other larger fixed income families in a low interest rate environment 
the cash fund assets  representing of the total fund assets at april   have increased from the previous year end 
the increase is due primarily to additional cash fund purchases by the parent company in the fourth quarter 
the parent has made no representations to value line as to how long the cash will remain in the value line cash fund 
expenses advertising and promotion year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs advertising and promotion advertising and promotion expenses for the twelve months ended april  decreased  as compared to the twelve months ended april  costs associated with direct mail decreased  or below last fiscal year  due to a targeted reduction in the overall number of pieces mailed year to year 
promotion expense for the twelve months ended april  declined by  as a result of the reversal of deferred advertising charges related to the sam and centurion funds 
expenditures for print media promoting the value line funds in select markets increased by  for the twelve months ended april  the major increase of  is due to fees paid to third party intermediaries supermarkets  such as  charles schwab co  inc to market the value line funds 
this expense will fluctuate based on assets invested in the value line funds by clients of the mutual fund supermarkets  and the change in market value of such assets 
the company anticipates third party intermediary expenses will continue to increase as more shareholders come into the value line funds through intermediaries rather than by opening direct accounts 
salary and employee benefits year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs salaries and employee benefits over the past several years  the company has increased productivity by combining the roles and responsibilities and by selective outsourcing 
some duplication of effort has been eliminated and certain tasks  such as some data entry  have been outsourced to third party vendors that the company believes can provide better controls and results at a favorable cost 
as of april  the company employed employees as compared to employees at year end april   and at year end april  production and distribution year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs production and distribution production and distribution expenses for the twelve months ended april  were  below expenses for the twelve months ended april  and production and distribution expenses for the fiscal year ended april  were  below expenses for fiscal year ended amortized software costs decreased  below last fiscal year due to a decrease in expenditures for capitalized projects 
in addition  the decline in expenses was due to volume reductions in paper  printing and mailing that resulted primarily from a decrease in circulation of the print products 
partially offsetting the savings during fiscal was an approximate increase in the cost of paper mid fiscal year and an increase in postage rates 
the company anticipates paper prices will increase over the upcoming fiscal year as raw material prices increase 
office and administration year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs office and administration office and administration expenses for the twelve months ended april  were  above expenses for the twelve months ended april  for the fiscal year ended april  office and administration expenses were  below expenses for fiscal during the last fiscal quarter of fiscal  the company amended its lease in midtown new york extending the lease expiration date to may on negotiated terms in place of the company s renewal option at market rate  which resulted in significantly higher rent as a result of market conditions compared to the original square footage terms negotiated in in addition  under the terms of its original lease  the company received a rent concession in the amount of  credited equally to the rent obligation during the six months beginning december this concession had no earnings impact since prepaid rent was amortized in the period but did positively impact the company s cash flow 
during fiscal year professional fees significantly increased as compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of the ongoing sec investigation 
professional fees fluctuate year to year based on the level of operations  litigation or regulatory activity requiring the use of outside professionals

liquidity and capital resources the company had working capital of  as of april  and  as of april  cash and short term securities totaled  as of april  and  as of april cash from operating activities the company s cash flow from operations of  for the twelve months ended april  was below cash flow from operations of  for the twelve months ended april  the primary change was the timing of purchases and maturity of fixed income government debt securities within the company s trading portfolio  and the decrease in accounts receivable 
in addition  beginning december  the company received a rent concession in the amount of  credited equally to the rent obligation over months 
the concession amounted to  during fiscal cash from investing activities the company s cash outflow from investing activities of  for the twelve months ended april  was above cash outflow from investing activities of  for the twelve months ended april  due to the maturity of fixed income securities during the prior fiscal year and the redeployment of cash holdings to equity securities and fixed income during fiscal cash from financing activities the company s net cash outflow from financing activities of  for the year ended april  increased as compared to the prior fiscal year due to the payment of a higher quarterly dividend per common share of in fiscal as compared to paid during the first and the second quarters and during the last two quarters of fiscal management believes that the company s cash and other liquid asset resources used in its business together with the future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance current and forecasted operations 
management does not anticipate any borrowing in fiscal critical accounting estimates and policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent and the company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition income taxes revenue recognition the majority of the company s revenues come from the sale of print and electronic subscriptions  investment management and service and distribution fees  and licensing proprietary information 
the company recognizes subscription revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription  which generally ranges from three months to one year or longer  varying based on the product or service 
investment management fees and service and distribution fee revenues for the value line funds are recognized each month based upon the daily net asset value of each fund 
licensing fees are calculated monthly based on market fluctuation and billed quarterly 
the company believes that the estimates related to revenue recognition are critical accounting estimates  and to the extent that there are material differences between its determination of revenues and actual results  its financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
income taxes the company s effective annual income tax expense rate is based on the us federal and state and local jurisdiction tax rates on income and losses that are part of its consolidated financial statements 
tax planning opportunities and the blend of business income and income from securities transactions will impact the effective tax rate in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s tax positions 
tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in its consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on the company s tax return the company s cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as non taxable income that is not includable in the company s tax return and expenses that are not deductible in the company s tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation and amortization expenses 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
as of april   the company had million of deferred tax liabilities and  of short term deferred tax assets 
in assessing the company s deferred tax assets  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company considers both positive and negative evidence  including tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income  and recent financial performance 
if after future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets the company determines a lesser allowance is required  the company would record a reduction to the income tax expense and to the valuation allowance in the period this determination was made 
this would cause the company s income tax expense  effective tax rate  and net income to fluctuate 
in addition  the company establishes reserves at the time that it determines that it is more likely than not that it will need to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
the company adjusts these reserves  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which the company has established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
such liabilities are recorded as income taxes payable in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which the company has previously established reserves are recognized as a reduction to the company s income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations below is a summary of certain contractual obligations in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations reflected on balance sheet total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risks 
the company s significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity prices 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with the company s business activities 
interest rate risk the company s strategy has been to acquire debt securities with low credit risk 
despite this strategy management recognizes and accepts the possibility that losses may occur 
to limit the price fluctuation in these securities from interest rate changes  the company s management invests primarily in short term obligations maturing in to years 
the fair values of the company s fixed maturity investments will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  and other general market conditions 
the following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets that are subject to interest rate risk 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios 
variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
for these reasons  actual results might differ from those reflected in the table

equity price risk the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices or management s estimates of fair value as of the balance sheet dates 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
value line invests a significant level of its assets in equity securities  primarily the value line funds 
each mutual fund invests in a variety of positions that may include equity and non equity positions 
the table below summarizes value line s equity price risks as of april  and and shows the effects of a hypothetical increase and a decrease in market prices as of those dates
