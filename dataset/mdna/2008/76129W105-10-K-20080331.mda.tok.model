such factors include  among others  our ability to maintain liquidity  our maintenance of patent protection  the impact of current litigation as it affects our costs as well as market access and the viability of our patents  the ability to successfully re negotiate or extend the btmd license agreement and the receipt of payments thereunder  the impact of dramatic increases in demand  our ability to quickly increase capacity in the event of a dramatic increase in demand  our ability to access the market  our ability to maintain or lower production costs  our ability to continue to finance research and development as well as operations and expansion of production  the increased interest of larger market players  specifically bd  in providing safety needle products  and other factors listed in item a 
risk factors 
given these uncertainties  undue reliance should not be placed on forward looking statements 
overview we have been manufacturing and marketing safety products into the marketplace since we are currently transitioning into providing other safety medical products in addition to safety syringe products which comprised of our sales in one such product  the patient safe syringe should enter the market in our products have been and continue to be distributed nationally through numerous distributors 
however  we have been blocked from access to the market by exclusive marketing practices engaged in by bd which dominates the market 
we believe that bd s monopolistic business practices continue despite their paying million in to settle a lawsuit with us for anticompetitive practices  business disparagement  and tortious interference 
although we made limited progress in some areas  such as the alternate care and international markets  our volumes are not as high as they should be given the nature and quality of our product  the federal and state legislation requiring use of safe needle devices  and the senate subcommittee hearings on gpos 
we continue to pursue various strategies to have better access to the hospital market  as well as other markets  including attempting to gain access to the market through our sales efforts  our innovative technology  introduction of new products and  when necessary  litigation 
we are focusing on methods of upgrading our manufacturing capability and efficiency in order to enable us to offer our technology at a reduced price 
we believe our current capitalization provides the resources necessary to implement these changes  improve profit margins  and improve our manufacturing capacity and efficiency  thereby reducing our unit cost 
we are also marketing more products internationally 
beginning in  we were given an award from path to supply syringes to various african countries 
awards increased significantly from to however  currently there is no funding for this program 
we are hopeful that funding will be re established 
if so  we will again also distribute our products under this program 
we continue to produce syringes and blood collection tube holders in little elm  texas 
additionally  an australian distributor was awarded a one year contract in march to supply our vanishpoint automated retraction syringes to all of queensland health s acute care facilities 
queensland health is a department within the government of queensland  australia 
the contract was effective immediately and renewable for two years 
vanishpoint products are distributed in australia by brisbane based scientific educational supplies pty ltd 
product purchases from double dove have enabled us to increase manufacturing capacity with little capital outlay and provided a competitive manufactured cost 
these purchases have enabled improved profit margins in spite of limited revenues 
the cost of production per unit has generally declined as volumes increased 
we currently obtain roughly of our finished products through double dove 
we believe we could make up any long term disruption in these supplies by utilizing more of the capacity at the little elm facility  except for cc and cc syringes which comprised about of our revenues 
we have a licensing agreement with btmd which expires on may  royalties that were expected in were not received due to the time needed to build the factory  assembly equipment  and the related infrastructure as well as the need of btmd to meet the requisite chinese government requirements 
the facility has been completed and btmd is in the process of meeting chinese government requirements 
although successful renegotiation and or extension of this agreement cannot be assured  we still continue to expect royalty payments although we are unable to predict the date we will begin to receive such royalties 
royalties should begin once chinese government requirements are met and btmd is able to produce and sell products 
historically  unit sales have increased in the latter part of the year due  in part  to the demands for syringes during the flu season 
we are committed to the expansion of an existing warehouse 
this expansion will increase our warehouse area  provide for additional office space  and add a second clean room 
liquidity and future capital resources at the present time management does not intend to raise equity capital in due to the litigation settlements  we have sufficient cash reserves and intend to rely on operations  cash reserves  and debt financing as the primary ongoing sources of cash 
historical sources of liquidity we have historically funded operations primarily from proceeds from private placements  loans  and litigation settlements 
we were capitalized with approximately  raised from six separate private placement offerings 
we raised  in cash from the private sales of an aggregate of  shares of convertible preferred stock 
in addition  we obtained a cancellation of  in debt and  in accounts payable in exchange for series v class b convertible preferred stock 
we obtained  in from bank loans of which  has been repaid and  was refinanced with a new note with st international 
additionally  we received a small business administration loan of  in to pay for portions of automated assembly equipment  multi cavity molds  and other equipment 
this loan has been repaid 
furthermore  we borrowed  in under our credit agreement with abbott 
in october we repaid the abbott note with proceeds from a new note from katie petroleum  inc katie petroleum for  and a portion of the proceeds from a private placement 
internal sources of liquidity to achieve break even quarters we need minimal access to hospital markets which has been difficult to obtain due to the monopolistic marketplace which was the subject of our initial lawsuit and now also included in our second lawsuit against bd 
we will also continue to attempt to gain access to the market through our sales efforts  innovative technology and the introduction of new products 
we are focusing on methods of upgrading our manufacturing capability and efficiency in order to enable us to offer our technology at a reduced price 
we believe our current capitalization provides the resources necessary to implement these changes and improve our manufacturing capacity and efficiency  thereby reducing our unit cost 
beginning in early  we began to receive shipment of product from double dove which enabled us to sell product at lower costs 
fluctuations in the cost and availability of raw materials and inventory and the ability to maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships could result in the need to manufacture all as opposed to of the products in the us this could temporarily increase unit costs as we ramp up domestic production 
we have a licensing agreement with btmd which expires on may  royalties that were expected in were not received due to the time needed to build the factory  assembly equipment  and the related infrastructure as well as the need of btmd to meet the requisite chinese government requirements 
the facility has been completed and btmd is in the process of meeting chinese government requirements 
although successful renegotiation and or extension of this agreement cannot be assured  we still continue to expect royalty payments although we are unable to predict the date we will begin to receive such royalties 
royalties should begin once chinese government requirements are met and btmd is able to produce and sell products 
we anticipate that receipt of such royalties would have a positive effect on our liquidity 
historically  unit sales have increased in the latter part of the year due  in part  to the demand for syringes during the flu season 
due to increased volumes  our manufacturing unit costs have tended to decline 
however  increasing oil and transportation costs could mitigate this trend 
as our products are made from petroleum products  the increasing costs of oil and transportation may have a negative impact on our costs to the extent they may not be recoverable through price increases of our products 
in the event we continue to have only limited market access and cash generated from operations and cash reserves become insufficient to support operations  we would take cost cutting measures to reduce cash requirements 
such measures could result in reduction of units being produced  reduction of workforce  reduction of salaries of officers and other nonhourly employees  and deferral of royalty payments 
external sources of liquidity we have obtained several loans over the past seven years see historical sources of liquidity  which have  together with proceeds from the sales of equities and litigation settlements  enabled us to pursue development and production of our products 
currently we believe we could obtain additional funds through loans if needed 
furthermore  the shareholders have previously authorized an additional  shares of a class c stock that could  if necessary  be authorized and used to raise funds through the sale of equity 
we are in the process of finalizing a loan for approximately million to fund the expansion of the warehouse which will include additional warehouse space  additional office space  and a new clean room 
capital resources in  we invested  in a limited liability company llc 
we are in the process of exercising our option to have that investment returned 
material commitments for expenditures capital expenditures in are dependent upon several factors  including  but not limited to  the success of projects to decrease production costs  the successful introduction of new products  and access to debt financing 
beginning in  we plan to expand our warehouse to include additional warehouse space  additional office space  and a new clean room 
this expansion will be funded by a loan from lewisville state bank  a division of st international  for approximately million  secured by a nd lien deed to the land and existing buildings 
trends in capital resources interest expense will increase due to the pending loan of approximately million  but will be somewhat mitigated by lower borrowing rates if current conditions in the credit markets continue 
interest income may be negatively affected by lower interest rates and our movement of cash to us treasury bills and other us government backed securities 
although we believe that we have granted credit to credit worthy firms  current economic conditions may affect the timing and or collectability of some accounts 
results of operations the following discussion contains trend information and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
our actual future results could differ materially from our historical results of operations and those discussed in the forward looking statements 
all period references are to our fiscal years ended december  or dollar amounts have been rounded for ease of reading 
comparison of year ended december   and year ended december  revenues increased due principally to increased sales in the international market 
domestic sales were of revenues with international sales comprising the remainder 
unit sales of the cc syringe increased and cc unit sales increased 
unit sales of all products increased 
the discount reimbursements ended in the discount reimbursement program expired after the settlement agreement under which it was established provided for a total of million in reimbursements 
we had recognized million in cumulative discount reimbursements by the third quarter of sales to three distributors accounted for and of our revenues in and  respectively 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly due to higher volumes offset by the lower average selling price principally in the international sales 
the increased volume of production resulted in a lower unit cost 
royalty expenses were flat 
as a result  gross profits increased and gross profit margins increased slightly from in to in operating expenses increased from the prior year primarily due to increases in general and administrative costs 
sales and marketing expenses declined due primarily to decreased marketing and trade show expense 
increased compensation and consulting costs were mitigated by reductions in stock option expenses and travel and entertainment 
research and development costs were somewhat higher 
we had increases in engineering costs due principally to validation testing and the development work on the iv safety catheter and higher compensation costs 
general and administrative costs increased due principally to higher legal expenses 
compensation costs  outside accounting costs  and distribution fees also increased 
stock option expenses  shareholder expenses  consulting and training decreased 
legal costs concerning the litigation against bd comprise the largest amount of legal fees and have a significant effect on our expenses 
our lawsuit against bd is currently scheduled for trial in march after conclusion of the trial  legal expenses are expected to decrease significantly 
the legal costs incurred in with regard to the abbott litigation are lower than those in we expect such costs to continue until the litigation is resolved 
we also have higher litigation expenses concerning omi 
we had decreases in taxes other than income taxes in we awarded merit increases to our employees in we donated product in an international humanitarian effort in there have been no stock options awarded since  therefore  this expense continues to decline as the costs become fully amortized with virtually none recorded in we also increased our allowance for bad debt 
preferred stock dividend requirements declined due to conversion of preferred stock into common stock 
the dividend arrearage at december   on all classes of preferred stock was approximately interest income decreased due to lower interest rates and cash balances 
interest expense decreased due to lower interest rates and debt balances 
we expect interest income to continue to decline because of declining cash balances  the market environment for declining interest rates  and the transfer of our cash to us treasury bills and other government backed securities 
interest expense will increase with the addition of a building loan in the approximate amount of million which is in the process of being finalized 
provision for income tax benefits consists primarily of the settlement in our favor of a state tax audit 
we also have a valuation reserve for all deferred taxes  with the exception of deferred taxes on the beneficial conversion feature associated with our note payable to katie petroleum 
cash flow from operations was negative for due principally to the loss for the year 
the effect of non cash expenses and the change in working capital were a positive million

domestic sales were of revenues with international sales comprising the remainder 
unit sales of the cc syringe increased and cc unit sales increased 
unit sales of all products increased 
the hospital market continues to lag despite very favorable promotional pricing under the discount program 
the increase in discount reimbursements in is due principally to the reduction of the promotional prices initiated in april  resulting in larger reimbursements  mitigated by the ending of the reimbursement of the discounts in the third quarter of the discount reimbursement program expired since the settlement agreement under which it was established provided for a total of million in reimbursements 
we had recognized million in cumulative discount reimbursements by the third quarter of sales to two distributors accounted for and of our revenues in and  respectively 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues increased due to the lower average selling price resulting from the ending of the discount reimbursement program mitigated by higher volumes of product produced and sold 
the increased volume of production resulted in a lower unit cost 
the effect of the reduction in staff in august also contributed to the lower unit cost in royalty expenses were higher due to an increase in gross revenues 
as a result  gross profits decreased  and gross profit margins declined from in to in operating expenses increased from the prior year due to increases in sales and marketing costs and general and administrative costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased as we continued to grow our sales force  resulting in higher compensation costs  marketing and promotional costs  and travel and entertainment 
we also had increased consulting expense mitigated by a reduction in stock option expense 
research and development costs were flat 
we had increases in consulting costs and decreases in engineering costs due principally to validation testing and the development work on the iv safety catheter in we began marketing the iv safety catheter in the first quarter of we anticipate that until we reach economies of scale in manufacturing this product  we will incur losses on its sale 
general and administrative costs increased due principally to higher legal costs  compensation costs  consulting  and taxes other than income taxes 
decreases in expenses include stock option expense  shareholder expenses  outside accounting costs  severance pay  and training 
the legal costs incurred in in regard to the abbott litigation are higher than those in we expect such costs to continue until the litigation is resolved 
we also have litigation expenses concerning omi 
compensation costs increased as officers and other salaries were brought into a more appropriate range in  the full effect being reflected in we also awarded merit increases to our employees in consulting costs increased due to our continuing efforts to penetrate us and international markets 
we had increases in taxes other than income taxes in we donated product in an international humanitarian effort in there have been no stock options awarded since  therefore  this expense continues to decline as the costs become fully amortized 
preferred stock dividend requirements declined due to conversion of preferred stock into common stock 
the dividend arrearage at december   on all classes of preferred stock was approximately interest income increased due to higher interest rates 
interest expense increased due to higher interest rates mitigated by lower debt balances 
provision for income tax benefits consists primarily of federal tax subject to carry back provisions 
state income taxes are also subject to the various states carry back rules 
we also have a valuation reserve for all deferred taxes  with the exception of deferred taxes on the beneficial conversion feature associated with our note payable to katie petroleum 
cash flow from operations was negative for due principally to the loss for the year 
the effect of non cash expenses and the change in working capital was a positive  investing activities utilized million in cash 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following chart summarizes our material obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts for long term debt as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt  including current maturities significant accounting policies we consider the following to be our most significant accounting policies 
careful consideration and review is given to these and all accounting policies on a routine basis to ensure that they are accurately and consistently applied 
accounts receivable we record trade receivables when revenue is recognized 
no product has been consigned to customers 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is primarily determined by review of specific trade receivables 
those accounts that are doubtful of collection are included in the allowance 
an additional allowance has been established based on a percentage of receivables outstanding 
these provisions are reviewed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
trade receivables are charged off when there is certainty as to their being uncollectible 
trade receivables are considered delinquent when payment has not been made within contract terms 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized for sales to distributors when title and risk of ownership passes to the distributor  generally upon shipment 
revenue is recorded on the basis of sales price to distributors  less contractual pricing allowances 
contractual pricing allowances consist of i rebates granted to distributors who provide tracking reports which show  among other things  the facility that purchased the products  and ii a provision for estimated contractual pricing allowances for products that we have not received tracking reports 
rebates are recorded when issued and are applied against the customer s receivable balance 
the provision for contractual pricing allowances is reviewed at the end of each quarter and adjusted for changes in levels of products for which there is no tracking report 
additionally  if it becomes clear that tracking reports will not be provided by individual distributors  the provision is further adjusted 
the estimated contractual allowance is netted against individual distributors accounts receivable balances for financial reporting purposes 
the resulting net balance is reflected in accounts receivable or accounts payable  as appropriate 
the terms and conditions of contractual pricing allowances are governed by contracts between us and our distributors 
revenue for shipments directly to end users is recognized when title and risk of ownership passes from us 
any product shipped or distributed for evaluation purposes is expensed 
our domestic return policy is set forth in our standard distribution agreement 
this policy provides that a customer may return incorrect shipments within days following arrival at the distributor s facility 
in all such cases the distributor must obtain an authorization code from us and affix the code to the returned product 
we will not accept returned goods without a returned goods authorization number 
we may refund the customer s money or replace the product 
our return policy also provides that a customer may return product that is overstocked 
overstocking returns are limited to two times in each month period up to one percent of distributor s total purchase of products for the prior month period 
all product overstocks and returns are subject to inspection and acceptance by manufacturer 
our international distribution agreements do not provide for any returns 
we record an allowance for estimated returns as a reduction to accounts receivable and gross sales 
historically  returns have been less than of total sales 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using a standard cost method  which approximates average cost 
a reserve is established for any excess or obsolete inventories 
marketing fees under a sales and marketing agreement with abbott  we paid marketing fees until we terminated the contract for breach 
the contracted services were to include participation in promotional activities  development of educational and promotional materials  representation at trade shows  clinical demonstrations  inservicing and training  and tracking reports detailing the placement of our products to end users 
marketing fees were accrued at the time of the sale of product to abbott 
these fees were paid after abbott provided us a tracking report of product sales to end users 
these costs were included in sales and marketing expense in the statements of operations 
no marketing fees have been accrued since october   the date the national marketing and distribution agreement with abbott was terminated 
we filed suit against abbott in august for breach of contract 
we do not expect the eventual liability for marketing fees  if any  to exceed the amount accrued 
reimbursed discounts we received reimbursed discounts from one of the settlement agreements reached in our previous federal antitrust lawsuit  retractable technologies  inc v 
bd  et al 
payments under the discount reimbursement program were recognized upon invoicing of amounts due under the agreement  provided collection was reasonably assured 
such amounts are presented in the statements of operations as a separate component of revenues 
all funds available under the discount reimbursement program were recognized by the third quarter of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our market risk exposures regarding our cash and cash equivalents are immaterial as we do not have instruments for trading purposes 
additionally  reasonable  possible near term changes in market rates or prices will not result in material near term losses in earnings
