item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction for a description of the company s business  refer to item of part i of this annual report on form k 
as indicated in item  the company is primarily engaged in three business segments the real estate business operated by amrep southwest and the fulfillment services and newsstand distribution services businesses operated by kable 
data concerning industry segments is set forth in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s foreign sales and activities are not significant 
the following provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
all references in this item to  and mean the fiscal years ended april   and critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company discloses its significant accounting policies in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of those financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas that require significant judgments and estimates to be made include i the determination of revenue recognition for the newsstand distribution services business  which is based on estimates of allowances for magazine returns to the company from wholesalers and the offsetting return of magazines by the company to publishers for credit  ii allowances for doubtful accounts  iii real estate cost of sales calculations  which are based on land development budgets and estimates of costs to complete  iv the determination of revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method for certain development contracts  which is determined based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the project  v cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long lived assets  goodwill impairment and assets held for sale  vi actuarially determined benefit obligations for pension plan accounting  and vii legal contingencies 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
there are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas 
management bases its critical assumptions on historical experience  third party data and various other estimates that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the most critical assumptions made in arriving at these accounting estimates include the following i newsstand distribution services revenues represent commissions earned from the distribution of publications for client publishers  which are recorded by the company at the time the publications go on sale in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
the publications generally are sold on a fully returnable basis  which is in accordance with prevailing trade practice 
accordingly  the company provides for estimated returns by charges to income that are determined on an issue by issue basis utilizing historical experience and current sales information 
the financial impact to the company of a change in the sales estimate for magazine returns to it from its wholesalers is substantially offset by the simultaneous change in the company s estimate of its cost of purchases since it passes on the returns to publishers for credit 
as a result  the effect of a difference between the actual and estimated return rates on the company s commission revenues is the amount of the commission attributable to the difference 
the effect of an increase or decrease in the company s estimated rate of returns of during any period would be dependent upon the mix of magazines involved and the related selling prices and commission rates  but would generally result in a change in that period s net commission revenues of approximately  ii management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by attempting to identify troubled accounts by analyzing the credit risk of specific customers and by using historical experience applied to the aging of accounts and  where appropriate within the real estate business  by reviewing any collateral which may secure a receivable  iii real estate development costs are incurred throughout the life of a project  and the costs of initial sales from a project frequently must include a portion of costs that have been budgeted based on engineering estimates or other studies  but not yet incurred  iv percentage of completion revenue recognition for certain development contracts is based on the percentage of total costs incurred to date in proportion to total estimated costs to complete the contract 
total estimated costs  and thus contract income  are impacted by several factors including  but not limited to  changes in the costs of subcontractors  materials and equipment  productivity and scheduling  v asset impairment determinations including that of goodwill  which is based on the fair value of reporting units are based upon the intended use of assets and expected future cash flows  vi benefit obligations and other pension plan accounting and disclosure is based upon numerous assumptions and estimates  including the expected rate of investment return on retirement plan assets  the discount rate used to determine the present value of liabilities  and certain employee related factors such as turnover  retirement age and mortality 
as of april   the effect of every change in the investment rate of return on retirement plan assets would increase or decrease the pension expense by approximately  per year  and the effect of every change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the subsequent year s pension cost of approximately  and vii the company is currently involved in legal proceedings which are described in item of this annual report on form k 
it is possible that the consolidated financial position or results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by an outcome of litigation that is significantly different from the company s assumptions 
year ended april  compared to year ended april  results of operations net income in was  or per share  compared to net income of  or per share 
results for consisted of net income from continuing operations of  or per share  and a net loss from discontinued operations of  or per share  compared to the results which consisted of net income from continuing operations of  or per share  and a net loss from discontinued operations of  or per share 
consolidated revenues were  a decrease of  from consolidated revenues of  the decrease in consolidated revenues was attributable to reduced land sales revenues from the company s real estate operations  offset in part by the increased fulfillment services revenues from the inclusion of palm coast s revenues for all of as compared with three and a half months in the decrease in net income from continuing operations was principally due to the reduced land sales 
the net loss from discontinued operations in was attributable to  of costs incurred in connection with the settlement of all litigation related to the company s el dorado  new mexico water utility subsidiary that were in addition to costs estimated and accrued for this matter in the fourth quarter of when in june  the company settled all existing litigation involving this subsidiary 
the amount accrued for the settlements  including legal fees  was  net of tax  and was also accounted for as a discontinued operation 
revenues from real estate land sales at amrep southwest decreased  from  in to  in this substantial revenue decrease was due to substantially lower land sales in the company s principal market of rio rancho  new mexico  reflecting the severe decline that occurred in this market in compared to and earlier years 
as previously reported  the number of permits for new home construction was down significantly for calendar compared to  with rio rancho showing a decrease of nearly 
the company believes that this decline was generally consistent with the well publicized problems of the national home building industry  including fewer sales of both new and existing homes  the increasing number of mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures and a tightening of mortgage availability 
faced with these adverse conditions  builders slowed the pace of building on land previously purchased from the company in rio rancho and  in some cases  delayed or cancelled the purchase of additional land 
these factors are also believed to have contributed to a sharp decline in sales of undeveloped land to both builders and investors 
revenues from sales of developed lots to homebuilders decreased from  in to  in  principally due to a reduction in the number of lots sold 
revenues from sales of undeveloped builder lots decreased from  in to  in  principally due to a reduction in the number of lots sold and  to a lesser extent  a lower average price per lot due to a greater number of lots sold from locations in rio rancho that are further removed from developed areas 
revenues from sales of commercial and industrial properties decreased in to  from  in as a result of fewer and smaller transactions 
the average gross profit percentage on land sales decreased from in to for  and is principally attributable to lower selling prices for commercial and undeveloped lots in the latter period 
the average selling price of land sold by the company in rio rancho in recent years has fluctuated  from  per acre in to  per acre in and  per acre in  reflecting differences in the mix of the types of properties sold in each period and the effects of a strong regional market in and in rio rancho and a much softer market in as a result of these and other factors  including the nature and timing of specific transactions  revenues and related gross profits from real estate land sales can vary significantly from period to period and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods 
revenues from kable s fulfillment services and newsstand distribution services businesses collectively  media services increased  from  in to  in  principally attributable to the january  acquisition of palm coast 
fulfillment services revenues increased by  from  in to  in due to the contribution from palm coast 
the increase in revenues from the palm coast acquisition was partially offset by decreases in other parts of kable s fulfillment services business that resulted from continued competitive market pressures and customer losses 
pricing pressure from customers also had a negative effect on fulfillment services revenues 
newsstand distribution services revenues decreased by  from  in to  in the decrease in newsstand distribution services revenues was due to reduced billings and lower commission rates  as well as the inclusion of certain revenues in the prior year that did not recur in media services operating expenses increased by  in compared to  primarily attributable to the addition of operating expenses of palm coast  which were offset in part by decreased payroll and benefit expenses resulting from lower revenue in other parts of kable s fulfillment services business 
although there are multiple revenue streams in the fulfillment services business  including revenues from the maintenance of customer computer files and the performance of other fulfillment related activities  including telephone call center support and graphic arts and lettershop services  a customer generally contracts for and utilizes all available services as a total package  and the company would not provide its ancillary services to a customer unless it was also providing the core service of maintaining a database of subscriber names 
thus  variations in fulfillment services revenues are the result of fluctuations in the number and sizes of customers rather than in the demand for a particular service 
this is also true in the newsstand distribution services business where there is only one primary service provided  which results in one revenue source  the commissions earned on the distribution of magazines 
the company competes with other companies  including three much larger companies in the newsstand distribution services business and one larger company in the fulfillment services business  and the competition for new customers is intense in both segments  which results in a price sensitive industry that may restrict the company s ability to increase its prices 
during fiscal  kable acquired the colorado based fulfillment services business of electronic data systems corporation eds 
since that time kable has outsourced to eds a substantial portion of the data processing required to service that business but during fiscal has migrated much of that activity to its own systems 
however  under the outsourcing contract  the full outsourcing charge remains payable so long as any outsourcing services are provided 
the company anticipates completing this migration process by september the migration process is technically complex  however  and the company continues to address issues that have delayed the complete migration 
should the company encounter unanticipated problems that will further delay the complete migration  it may continue to be burdened with the outsourcing of this business 
the company has announced a project to integrate certain other aspects of the kable and palm coast fulfillment operations in order to improve operating efficiencies and customer service and also to reduce costs 
to date  this project has resulted in i one significant workforce reduction that occurred in the first quarter of  ii an announced plan in the second quarter of to redistribute the fulfillment services work performed at the marion  ohio facility of its fulfillment services business and the scheduled closing of that facility and iii the consolidation of the fulfillment operations customer call center 
approximately  in severance related costs is projected to be paid in connection with the ohio facility closure  which is being recorded as positions are eliminated during the transitional period scheduled to end in september as of april   severance related costs charged to operations totaled  following the closure of the ohio facility  the company anticipates realizing annual cost savings of approximately  from the three actions noted above 
the company incurred costs directly related to the integration project of  in  principally for severance and other consulting costs related to the integration  and these costs are included in the restructuring and fire recovery costs in the company s consolidated statement of income 
on december  a warehouse of approximately  square feet leased by the company in oregon  illinois was totally destroyed by an accidental fire 
the warehouse was used principally to store back issues of magazines published by certain customers for whom the company fills back issue orders as part of its services 
the company has submitted preliminary claims to its insurance provider for its property loss and for a business interruption claim consisting of its lost revenues offset by reduced expenses through april  while the company has been advanced  for replacement of lost property  no insurance proceeds have been received on the business interruption claim as of april  in addition  the company was required to provide insurance for certain of those customers whose property was destroyed in the warehouse fire 
the company does not believe that the net effect of the outcome of claims related to materials of certain publishers for whom it was required to provide insurance  together with any proceeds received from its property and business interruption claims  will have any material effect on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
due to the fire  gross assets were written down by  along with related accumulated depreciation on those assets of about  resulting in a charge to operations of approximately  in addition  the company has recorded other charges to operations of  related to fire recovery costs for the year ended april   principally due to legal and other costs that are not covered by insurance and these costs are included in the restructuring and fire recovery costs in the company s consolidated statement of income 
real estate commissions and selling expenses decreased  in compared to principally attributable to the reduced volume of land sales 
other operating expenses decreased  in compared to principally due to a favorable adjustment of approximately  in the third quarter of for real estate tax expense resulting from the finalization of a property tax valuation appeal by amrep southwest 
media services general and administrative expenses increased  in compared to as the addition of the palm coast expenses was only partially offset by lower costs in other fulfillment services operations 
real estate operations and corporate general and administrative expenses decreased  in compared to principally as a result of lower professional and consulting services costs 
interest and other revenues decreased by  in compared to the decrease was partly attributable to lower cash balances to invest in in addition  during  the company sold a commercial rental property at amrep southwest that resulted in a pre tax gain of  and it also recognized pre tax income of  from the forfeiture of deposits for the purchase of land by homebuilders who did not exercise purchase options 
during the first quarter of  the company sold certain of amrep southwest s investment assets  including the company s office building in rio rancho  which in the aggregate contributed a pre tax gain of  the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations was in compared to in the decrease from the statutory rate in both years was primarily due to tax benefits associated with charitable contributions of land and tax exempt interest income 
year ended april  compared to year ended april  results of operations net income in was  or per share  compared to net income of  or per share 
results for consisted of net income from continuing operations of  or per share  and a net loss from discontinued operations of  or per share  compared to the results which consisted of net income from continuing operations of  or per share  and net income from discontinued operations of  or per share 
consolidated revenues were  an increase of  over consolidated revenues of  the increase in consolidated revenues was attributable to continued revenue growth achieved by the company s real estate operations  and  to a lesser extent  the acquisition of palm coast by the company s kable media services  inc subsidiary 
the increase in net income from continuing operations was attributable to higher gross profits associated with the increased real estate land sales 
net income from discontinued operations in reflected the gain from the disposition of the primary assets of the company s el dorado  new mexico water utility subsidiary  which were taken through condemnation proceedings during in june  the company settled all existing litigation involving this subsidiary and accrued for the estimated amount of the settlements  including legal fees  of approximately  net of tax  which was accounted for as a loss from discontinued operations in revenues from real estate land sales at amrep southwest increased  from  for to  in this substantial revenue increase was due to higher average selling prices and increased sales of both developed and undeveloped lots as well as commercial and industrial properties in the company s principal market of rio rancho  new mexico 
an increase in revenues from additional sales in all categories of residential and commercial lots in compared to resulted from the strength of the rio rancho market  particularly in the first six months of the year 
revenues from sales of developed lots to homebuilders increased from  in to  in revenues from sales of undeveloped builder lots increased from  in to  principally due to higher prices for scattered builder lots  and revenues from sales of commercial and industrial properties increased in to  from  in as a result of an increased number of and size of transactions 
the average gross profit percentage on land sales increased from in to for  reflecting higher average selling prices in and the mix of developed and undeveloped residential lots sold in each of the periods 
the average selling price of land sold by the company in rio rancho increased from  per acre in to  per acre in this increase was due to a number of factors  including differences in the mix of the types of properties sold in each period and the effects of a strong regional market which resulted in three consecutive years of a record number of single family residential housing starts in rio rancho  reaching a total in excess of  starts during the twelve months ending april  the real estate market in rio rancho softened during  however  and there was a decline in the number of housing starts in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  in may rio rancho s largest employer  intel corporation  announced a workforce reduction starting in august of at least  jobs in rio rancho  which could reduce the demand for the company s land inventory 
as a result of these and other factors  including the nature and timing of specific transactions  revenues and related gross profits from real estate land sales can vary significantly from period to period and prior results are not necessarily a good indication of what may occur in future periods 
revenues from kable s fulfillment services and newsstand distribution services businesses collectively  media services increased  from  in to  in this increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the january  acquisition of palm coast 
newsstand distribution services revenues increased by  from  in to  in  principally due to a increase in revenues from new business 
fulfillment services revenues increased by  from  in to  in due to the addition of palm coast 
the increase in revenues from the palm coast acquisition was partially offset by decreases in core and ancillary services of customer telephone  lettershop and list services of other parts of kable s fulfillment services business 
the revenue decreases in core and ancillary services resulted from continued competitive market pressures and customer losses 
pricing pressure from customers due to the competitive environment for fulfillment services business also had a negative effect on fulfillment services revenues and profitability in the fourth quarter of media services operating expenses increased by  in compared to  primarily attributable to i the addition of operating expenses of palm coast and ii an increase in newsstand distribution services operating expenses  principally payroll  associated with the revenue growth of that business  offset in part by decreased payroll and benefit expenses in other parts of kable s fulfillment services businesses 
media services general and administrative expenses increased  in compared to as the addition of palm coast was only partially offset by lower costs in other fulfillment services businesses 
real estate commissions and selling expenses remained generally unchanged in compared to despite the increase in land sales  primarily due to decreases in variable commissions and selling expenses

 which provides all entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the objective of sfas no

segment information information by industry segment is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this information has been prepared in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related disclosures  which requires that industry segment information be prepared in a manner consistent with the manner in which financial information is prepared and evaluated by management for making operating decisions 
a number of assumptions and estimations are required to be made in the determination of segment data  including the need to make certain allocations of common costs and expenses among segments 
on an annual basis  management has evaluated the basis upon which costs are allocated  and has periodically made revisions to these methods of allocation 
accordingly  the determination of income from continuing operations before income taxes of each segment as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements is presented for informational purposes  and is not necessarily the amount that would be reported if the segment were an independent company 
impact of inflation operations of the company can be impacted by inflation 
within the industries in which the company operates  inflation can cause increases in the cost of materials  services  interest and labor 
unless such increased costs are recovered through increased sales prices or improved operating efficiencies  operating margins will decrease 
within the land development industry  the company encounters particular risks 
a large part of the company s real estate sales are to homebuilders who face their own inflationary concerns that rising housing costs  including interest costs  may substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers and make it difficult for them to finance the purchase of a new home or sell their existing home 
if this situation were to exist  the demand for the company s land by these homebuilder customers could decrease 
in general  in recent years interest rates have been at historically low levels and other price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in the company s markets  and as a result the company has not found the inflation risk to be a significant problem in its real estate or media services operations businesses
