during the first quarter of fiscal we sold our baseband chipset business and related support operations  or baseband chipset business  to mediatek inc and sold our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation 
the financial results of these businesses are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
the assets and liabilities related to these businesses are reflected as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets as of november  and november  the historical results of operations of these businesses have been segregated from our consolidated financial statements and are included in income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  in the consolidated statements of income 
unless otherwise noted  this management s discussion and analysis relates only to financial results from continuing operations 
results of operations overview fiscal year total revenue gross margin net income from continuing operations net income from continuing operations as a of total revenue diluted eps from continuing operations diluted eps the year to year revenue changes by end market and product category are more fully outlined below under revenue trends by end market and revenue trends by product 
in fiscal year  our product revenue increased from fiscal and our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations increased by 
we sold two businesses during the year that resulted in net cash proceeds of million and a million net gain in fiscal we report these two businesses below as discontinued operations 
our fiscal cash flow from operations was million  or of revenue  and we had  million of cash and short term investments and no debt as of november  
table of contents while we achieved good operating results for fiscal  the global credit crisis and deteriorating economic conditions have resulted in more cautious customer spending behavior and generally lower demand for our products 
we cannot predict the severity  duration or precise impact of the economic downturn on our future financial results 
consequently  our reported results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year may not be indicative of our future results 
order rates slowed in late september  and backlog declined significantly from the prior quarter  which limits our short term visibility 
forecasting revenue in this environment is difficult 
therefore  as more fully described in the outlook section below  our operating plan is for revenues to decline approximately in the first quarter of fiscal from the amount recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenue trends by end market the categorization of revenue by end market is determined using a variety of data points including the technical characteristics of the product  the sold to customer information  the ship to customer information and the end customer product or application into which our product will be incorporated 
as data systems for capturing and tracking this data evolve and improve  the categorization of products by end market can vary over time 
when this occurs  we reclassify revenue by end market for prior periods 
such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of  or the underlying trends of results within  each end market 
of of of total total total product product product revenue revenue y y revenue revenue revenue revenue industrial communications consumer computer total product revenue revenue from one time ip license total revenue the year ended november  was a week year 
we follow a week  or day fiscal calendar that results in a week year approximately every seventh year  as occurred in fiscal industrial the year to year increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of revenue growth in products sold into the instrumentation and automotive sectors and  to a lesser extent  the defense sector 
these increases were partially offset by a decline in revenue from automatic test equipment 
the year to year increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of revenue growth in products sold into the automotive area and to a lesser extent the instrumentation portion of the industrial end market 
these sales increases were partially offset by a decline in sales to automatic test equipment customers 
communications the year to year increases from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal were primarily the result of revenue growth in sales of analog products used in basestations and wireless handsets 
the increase in sales from fiscal to fiscal was partially offset by a decrease in sales to networking customers 
consumer the year to year decrease from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in revenue from advanced television and digital camera applications that was offset by a decline in revenue from other consumer applications  consistent with the global slowdown in consumer spending 
the year to year increase from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of increased sales of our products used in video game applications  advanced television systems and digital home applications 

table of contents computer the year to year decreases from fiscal to fiscal and from fiscal to fiscal were primarily the result of broad based declines in sales of our products into this end market 
revenue from one time ip license during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded revenue of million received in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party 
revenue trends by product the following table summarizes revenue by product categories 
the categorization of our products into broad categories is based on the characteristics of the individual products  the specification of the products and in some cases the specific uses that certain products have within applications 
the categorization of products into categories is therefore subject to judgment in some cases and can vary over time 
in instances where products move between product categories we reclassify the amounts in the product categories for all prior periods 
such reclassifications typically do not materially change the sizing of  or the underlying trends of results within  each product category 
of of of total total total product product product revenue revenue y y revenue revenue revenue revenue converters amplifiers other analog subtotal analog signal processing power management reference total analog products general purpose dsp other dsp total dsp products total product revenue revenue from one time ip license total revenue the year ended november  was a week year 
we follow a week  or day fiscal calendar that results in a week year approximately every seventh year  as occurred in fiscal the increase in sales from fiscal to fiscal was the result of a broad based increase in sales across many of our product categories 
the increase in sales of converters and amplifiers was primarily attributable to an increase in demand for our products used in the industrial and communications end markets 
the significant changes in our revenue trends by product type from fiscal to fiscal were the year to year increases in our converters and amplifiers 
in addition the other analog product category increased primarily as a result of increased sales of products used in video game applications 
the year to year decrease from fiscal to fiscal in the other dsp product category was primarily attributable to the loss of revenue from our dsp based dsl asic and network processor product line that we sold in fiscal this decrease was partially offset by an increase in revenues from our general purpose dsp products 

table of contents revenue trends by geographic region the percentage of product sales from continuing operations by geographic region  based upon point of sale  for the last three years is as follows fiscal year region united states rest of north and south america europe japan china rest of asia the predominant countries comprising rest of north and south america are canada and mexico 
the predominant countries comprising european operations are germany  france and the united kingdom 
the predominant countries comprising rest of asia are taiwan and korea 
revenue in the united states declined from to of total revenue over the past three fiscal years 
this geographic shift of revenue reflects the increased manufacturing activity of our customers in locations outside the united states  primarily china and our success in markets located outside of the united states 
gross margin fiscal year gross margin gross margin gross margin percentage in fiscal was lower by basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal gross margin percentage in fiscal was higher primarily as a result of recording revenue of million we received in exchange for the licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales 
gross margin percentage in fiscal decreased by basis points from the gross margin recorded in fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of higher sales of products used in consumer electronics in fiscal  which were primarily manufactured at external foundries where we earned lower gross margins compared to our average gross margin 
this gross margin percentage decrease in fiscal was partially offset by the million in revenue recorded in the first quarter of fiscal in exchange for licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales 
fiscal year cost of sales also included approximately million of restructuring related expenses  of which million was accelerated depreciation 
stock based compensation expense during the first quarter of fiscal  on october   we adopted the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
we calculate compensation cost on the date of grant using the fair value of stock options as calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
as of november   the total compensation cost related to unvested awards not yet recognized in the statement of income was approximately million before tax consideration  which will be recognized over a weighted average period of years

table of contents research and development r d fiscal year r d expenses r d expenses as a of product revenue r d expenses in fiscal increased by million  or  from the amount recorded in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of higher employee salary  benefit and bonus expenses  which were partially offset by one fewer week of operations in fiscal than in fiscal and lower employee stock option expenses 
r d expenses in fiscal increased by million  or  from the amount recorded in fiscal the increase in r d expenses was primarily the result of an increase in employee salary and benefit expense in fiscal  primarily as a result of an increase in our employee population and to a lesser extent the impact of the extra week of operations in fiscal these increases were partially offset by lower employee bonus expenses during fiscal as compared to fiscal r d expenses as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate from year to year depending on the amount of revenue and the success of new product development efforts  which we view as critical to our future growth 
at any point in time we have hundreds of r d projects underway  and we believe that none of these projects is material on an individual basis 
we expect to continue the development of innovative technologies and processes for new products  and we believe that a continued commitment to r d is essential in order to maintain product leadership with our existing products and to provide innovative new product offerings  and therefore  we expect to continue to make significant r d investments in the future

table of contents in process research and development in fiscal or see acquisitions below for additional information regarding these acquisitions 
special charges closure of wafer fabrication facility in sunnyvale during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million as a result of a decision to close our california wafer fabrication operations and transfer virtually all of the production of products manufactured there to our facility in wilmington  massachusetts 
the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs that we recorded pursuant to sfas  employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  or sfas  under our ongoing benefit plan for manufacturing employees and general and administrative employees 
the severance benefit is based on the length of past service  and employees had to continue to be employed until their employment was involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit 
we completed the final cleanup and closure activities associated with this action during the second quarter of fiscal in addition we recorded additional expense during fiscal related to the sunnyvale facility closure  which consisted of million of non cash cost of sales expenses for additional depreciation due to shortened useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment and million for stay on bonuses for certain employees critical to facilitating the closure of this facility 
we reversed approximately million of the severance accrual during fiscal because some employees voluntarily left the company and other employees found alternative employment within the company 
in addition  there was an over accrual related to fringe benefits because severance payments  normally paid as income continuance  were paid in lump sum payments  which reduced the benefit costs associated with these payments 
we have terminated the employment of all of the employees included in this action 
we ceased production at the wafer fabrication facility on november  during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded additional expense  in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities or  sfas  which consisted of million for clean up and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred and million for lease obligation costs for a warehouse facility we ceased using during the first quarter of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge  in accordance with sfas  which included million of expense for future lease obligation costs for the wafer fabrication facility that we ceased using during the second quarter of fiscal the lease obligation costs are being paid out on a monthly basis over the remaining lease term  which expires in also included in this special charge was million for facility clean up and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred 
we completed the clean up activity during the second quarter of fiscal  and we do not expect to incur any additional charges related to this action 
the closure of this facility has resulted in annual cost savings of approximately million per year beginning in fiscal these annual savings include approximately million in cost of sales  of which approximately million relates to non cash depreciation savings  and approximately million in smg a expenses 
at current demand levels  if this facility were still in operation  the capacity of the facility would be largely underutilized resulting in significant adverse manufacturing variances associated with the underutilization of our wafer fabrication facilities 
reorganization of product development and support programs during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million as a result of our decision to reorganize our product development and support programs with the goal of providing greater focus on our analog and digital signal processing product programs 
the charge was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for manufacturing employees and engineering and selling  marketing  general and administrative employees associated with these programs 
during fiscal  we recorded an additional special charge of million related to this reorganization action 
approximately million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility that we ceased using 
table of contents during the first quarter of fiscal and the write off of property  plant and equipment and other items at this facility 
the remaining million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal pursuant to sfas under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for engineering and selling  marketing  general and administrative employees associated with these programs 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional special charge of million related to this reorganization action 
approximately million of this charge was for contract termination costs 
the remaining million relates to severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas under our ongoing benefit plan for six engineering employees associated with these programs 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded an additional special charge of million related to this reorganization action 
approximately million related to the severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas under our ongoing benefit plan or minimum statutory requirements at foreign locations for engineering and selling  marketing  general and administrative employees 
the remaining million of this charge was for lease obligation costs for a facility that we ceased using during the second quarter of fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed approximately million of our severance accrual because some employees voluntarily left the company and other employees found alternative employment within the company  and were therefore no longer entitled to severance payments 
the employment of all employees associated with these programs has been terminated and amounts owed to employees for severance are being paid out as income continuance 
we do not expect to incur any further charges related to this reorganization action 
these organizational changes  which were fully implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal  have resulted in savings of approximately million per year 
these annual savings include approximately million in r d expenses  approximately million in smg a expenses and approximately million in cost of sales 
as this action was completed during fiscal  a portion of these annual savings is reflected in our results for fiscal and all of the annual savings are reflected in our fiscal results 
fourth quarter of fiscal special charges consolidation of a wafer fabrication facility in limerick during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million as a result of our decision to only use eight inch technology at our wafer fabrication facility in limerick 
certain manufacturing processes and products produced on the limerick facility s six inch production line will transition to our existing eight inch production line in limerick while others will transition to external foundries 
the charge is for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas under our ongoing benefit plan for manufacturing employees associated with these action 
as of november   of the employees included in this cost reduction action were still employed by us 
we expect production to cease in the six inch wafer fabrication facility during the first half of  at which time the employment of the remaining affected employees will be terminated 
these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an additional charge of million related to this action  of which million was an adjustment to our original estimate of the severance costs and million was for clean up and closure costs that were charged to expense as incurred 
we expect to incur additional clean up and closure costs related to this action over the next three quarters totaling approximately million 
in accordance with sfas  we will expense these costs as incurred 
we estimate that the closure of this facility will result in annual cost savings of approximately million per year  expected to start during the second quarter of fiscal we expect these annual savings will be in cost of sales  of which approximately million relates to non cash depreciation savings 
reduction of overhead infrastructure costs during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to either deemphasize or exit certain businesses or products and focus investments in products and end markets where we have better opportunities for profitable growth 
in september  we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our baseband chipset business 
as a result  we decided to reduce the support infrastructure in manufacturing  engineering and smg a to more appropriately reflect our required overhead structure 
consequently  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we 
table of contents recorded a special charge of million  of which million was for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for manufacturing employees and engineering and selling  marketing  general and administrative employees associated with this action 
the remaining million was for contract termination costs related to a license agreement associated with products we will no longer develop and for which there is no future alternative use 
as of november   we still employed of the employees included in this cost reduction action 
these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit 
we expect these cost reduction actions  which were substantially completed in the second quarter of fiscal  to result in savings of approximately million per year 
we expect these savings to be realized as follows approximately million in r d expenses  approximately million in smg a expenses and approximately million in cost of sales 
a portion of these savings is reflected in our results for fiscal fourth quarter of special charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to further reduce the operating cost structure of our company 
consequently  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a special charge of million for severance and fringe benefit costs recorded pursuant to sfas under our ongoing benefit plan or statutory requirements at foreign locations for engineering and smg a employees 
as of november  we still employed  of the employees included in this cost reduction action 
these employees must continue to be employed by us until their employment is involuntarily terminated in order to receive the severance benefit 
we expect this cost reduction action  which we expect to complete during the first quarter of fiscal  to result in savings of approximately million per year 
we expect these savings to be realized as follows approximately million in r d expenses and approximately million in smg a expenses 
operating income from continuing operations fiscal year operating income from continuing operations operating income from continuing operations as a of total revenue the million  or  increase in operating income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in total revenue of million and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in special charges of million 
this increase in operating income from continuing operations was partially offset by a basis point decrease in gross margin percentage  an increase in operating expenses as more fully described above under the headings research and development and selling  marketing  general and administrative  and the fact that fiscal included million in non product revenue that we received in exchange for the licensing of certain intellectual property rights to a third party with no associated cost of sales 
operating income increased by million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was the result of a million increase in revenue  which was partially offset by a basis point decrease in gross margin percentage and a million increase in operating expenses as more fully described above under the headings research and development and selling  marketing  general and administrative  special charges and purchased in process research and development 
nonoperating income expense fiscal year interest income other  net total nonoperating income nonoperating income in fiscal was lower by million as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of lower average invested cash balances and  to a lesser extent  lower interest rates in fiscal as compared 
table of contents to fiscal in addition  other income in fiscal included million we received as part of a litigation settlement and a million gain from the sale of an investment 
the million decrease in nonoperating income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was a result of lower invested cash balances that were partially offset by the higher interest rates in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease in interest income was partially offset by a million gain from the sale of an investment and a million settlement we received in fiscal in fiscal  we also recognized a million gain on the sale of our dsp based dsl asic and network processor product line 
provision for income taxes fiscal year provision for income taxes effective income tax rate our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was lower by basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal the tax rate included the following transactions  which were taxed at the higher us tax rate the one time receipt of million associated with the licensing of intellectual property to a third party  million we received from a settlement of litigation and the million gain on the sale of an investment 
in addition  the tax rate included tax expense related to the finalization of the accounting for a acquisition 
these items  which had the effect of increasing the tax rate  were partially offset by a higher r d credit in fiscal than in fiscal in addition to these isolated transactions that impacted our tax rate  a larger percentage of our profits were earned in lower tax jurisdictions during fiscal  as compared to fiscal causing a decrease in our tax rate 
our effective tax rate for fiscal was higher by basis points compared to our effective tax rate for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the recording of tax benefits of million associated with the completion of an internal revenue service  or irs  examination during fiscal  including the reversal of penalty accruals and the filing of refund claims in other jurisdictions associated with the completion of the irs audit 
the increase was also attributable to the following fiscal transactions  which were taxed at the higher us tax rate the one time receipt of million associated with the licensing of intellectual property to a third party  the gain on the sale of an investment of million and million received from the settlement of litigation 
in addition  we recorded an additional million of taxes and penalties in fiscal for proposed adjustments related to the irs examination of fiscal and fiscal and a million tax adjustment related to the finalization of the accounting associated with a fiscal acquisition 
these items were partially offset by a tax benefit of million from the reinstatement of the us federal research and development tax credit in fiscal and a million cumulative adjustment recorded in fiscal related to the application of this credit to a portion of our fiscal results 
income from continuing operations  net of tax fiscal year income from continuing operations  net of tax income from continuing operations  net of tax as a of total revenue diluted eps from continuing operations income from continuing operations  net of tax  in fiscal was higher than in fiscal by approximately million primarily as a result of the million increase in operating income from continuing operations that was partially offset by a million decrease in nonoperating income and a lower provision for income taxes in fiscal 
table of contents income from continuing operations  net of tax  was lower in fiscal than in fiscal by approximately million primarily as a result of the million decrease in nonoperating income and the impact of a higher effective income tax rate in fiscal these items  which had the impact of decreasing income from continuing operations  net of tax  were partially offset by the million increase in operating income from continuing operations 
the impact of inflation and foreign currency exchange rate movement on our results of operations during the past three fiscal years has not been significant 
discontinued operations fiscal year income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of tax total income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax diluted earnings loss per share from discontinued operations we sold our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc and our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation during the first quarter of fiscal accordingly  the results of the operations of these businesses have been presented as discontinued operations within the consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas no

under sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  all income tax payments are included in determining net cash flow from operating activities  but the cash received from the sale of the businesses must be reported as an investing cash inflow 
we sold our baseband chipset business to mediatek inc and our cpu voltage regulation and pc thermal monitoring business to certain subsidiaries of on semiconductor corporation during the first quarter of fiscal the cash flows from these discontinued operations have been combined with the operating  investing and financing cash flows from continuing operations ie no separate classification of cash flows from discontinued operations for all periods presented 
we believe the absence of the cash flows from these discontinued operations will not have a material impact on our future liquidity and financial position

after the end of the fiscal year  on november   our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per outstanding share of our common stock 
the dividend is payable on december  to shareholders of record on december  and is expected to total approximately million 

table of contents our common stock repurchase program has been in place since august in the aggregate  the board of directors has authorized us to repurchase billion of our common stock under the program 
under the program  we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions 
unless terminated earlier by resolution of our board of directors  the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized under the program 
we repurchased approximately million shares for approximately million during fiscal as of november   we had repurchased a total of approximately million shares of our common stock for approximately  million under this program and an additional million remains under the current authorized program 
the repurchased shares are held as authorized but unissued shares of common stock 
we also from time to time repurchase shares in settlement of employee tax withholding obligations due upon the vesting of restricted stock or restricted stock units or the exercise of stock options 
any future common stock repurchases will be dependent upon the amount of cash we have available to us in the united states 
at november   our principal source of liquidity was  million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of november   approximately million of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were held in the united states 
the balance of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was held outside the united states in various foreign subsidiaries 
as we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely  this cash is not available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the united states  including for cash dividends and common stock repurchases 
as a result  we entered into a five year million unsecured revolving credit facility in may in order to supplement our occasional cash requirements in the united states 
to date  we have not borrowed under this credit facility but we may borrow in the future and use the proceeds for support of commercial paper issuance  stock repurchases  dividend payments  acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital and other lawful corporate purposes 
the volatility in the credit markets has generally diminished liquidity and capital availability in worldwide markets 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions 
however  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations  together with existing and anticipated available long term financing  will be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures  research and development efforts  dividend payments if any and purchases of stock if any under our stock repurchase program for at least the next twelve months 
the table below summarizes our contractual obligations and the amounts we owe under these contracts in specified periods as of november  payment due by period less than more than thousands total year years years years contractual obligations operating leases a deferred compensation plan b pension funding c total a certain of our operating lease obligations include escalation clauses 
these escalating payment requirements are reflected in the table 
b these payments relate to obligations under our deferred compensation plan 
the deferred compensation plan allows certain members of management and other highly compensated employees and non employee directors to defer receipt of all or any portion of their compensation 
prior to january   participants could also defer gains on stock options and restricted stock granted before july  the amount in the more than years column of the table represents the remaining total balance under the deferred compensation plan to be paid to participants who have not terminated employment 
since we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of withdrawals for participants who have not yet terminated employment we have included the future obligation 
table of contents to these participants in the more than years column of the table 
all other columns represent installment payments to be made to those employees who have retired or are on long term disability 
c our funding policy for our foreign defined benefit plans is consistent with the local requirements of each country 
the payment obligations in the table are estimates of our expected contributions to these plans for fiscal year the actual future payments may differ from the amounts presented in the table and reasonable estimates of payments beyond one year are not practical because of potential future changes in variables such as plan asset performance  interest rates and the rate of increase in compensation levels 
purchase orders for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the total amount of these purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
in addition  our purchase orders generally allow for cancellation without significant penalties 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected short term requirements 
as of november   our total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions under fin was million  which are included in other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet contained in item of this annual report on form k as a result of our adoption of fin due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties  we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions 
therefore  we have not included these uncertain tax positions in the above contractual obligations table 
the expected timing of payments and the amounts of the obligations discussed above are estimated based on current information 
off balance sheet financing as of november   we had no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
outlook the following statements are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking  and actual results may differ materially 
unless specifically mentioned  these statements do not give effect to the potential impact of any mergers  acquisitions  divestitures  or business combinations that may be announced or closed after the date of filing this report 
these statements supersede all prior statements regarding business outlook made by us 
the global credit crisis and deteriorating economic conditions have resulted in more cautious customer spending behavior and generally lower demand 
order rates slowed in late september  and backlog declined significantly from the prior quarter  which limits our short term visibility into future revenues 
forecasting revenue in this environment is difficult 
our operating plan is for revenue to decline approximately in the first quarter of fiscal from revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal we are planning to take steps to avoid a large inventory buildup by significantly reducing manufacturing output  which we expect will temporarily impact our gross margin by approximately to percentage points 
we are therefore planning for gross margin to be approximately to in the first quarter of fiscal  depending on the actual product mix and level of sales we achieve 
further  we are planning to take actions in the first quarter of fiscal that we expect will result in operating expense reductions from fourth quarter levels of approximately  or million 
we expect to realize over half of that savings in the first quarter of fiscal and the balance in the second quarter of fiscal as a result of these anticipated actions  we plan to record a restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently in the process of finalizing our plans to reduce costs and are unable to determine the amount of the restructuring charge at this point 
assuming these levels of sales and resulting gross margin  anticipated cost reductions  and an effective tax rate of  we expect diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the first quarter of fiscal to be approximately to  excluding restructuring charges 
we are responding to the current economic environment by taking actions that we expect will reduce expenses in the short term while strengthening our position for the long term 
we anticipate that our variable and discretionary cost reductions will fluctuate with general economic conditions  while the actions related to realigning our product 
table of contents portfolio and streamlining our manufacturing infrastructure will result in short term savings as well as a lower cost structure 
while we believe that we have taken steps to mitigate the short term reduction in our earnings and position ourselves for significant earnings leverage when growth resumes  there can be no assurances that market conditions will improve or that our actions will be sufficient to counteract those market conditions 
new accounting pronouncements derivative instruments and hedging activities in march  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas changes the disclosure requirements for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires entities to provide enhanced disclosures about how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas and its related interpretations  and how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance and cash flows 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas may have on our financial condition and results of operations 
the adoption of sfas will change our disclosures for derivative instruments and hedging activities beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year business combinations in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r requires an acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the assets acquired  liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at their fair value on the acquisition date 
it further requires that acquisition related costs and restructuring costs be recognized separately from the acquisition 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which is our fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas r may have on our financial condition and results of operations 
the adoption of sfas r will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year noncontrolling interests in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas clarifies that a noncontrolling or minority interest in a subsidiary is considered an ownership interest and  accordingly  requires all entities to report such interests in subsidiaries as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   which is our fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas may have on our financial condition and results of operations 
accounting for financial assets and financial liabilities in february  the fasb  issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which is our fiscal year we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas may have on our financial condition and results of operations 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the standard also provides for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies 
table of contents whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
this standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   which is our fiscal year the adoption of sfas in the first quarter of fiscal will not materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
the adoption of sfas will expand our disclosures pertaining to the measurement of assets and liabilities beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  knowledge of current conditions and beliefs of what could occur in the future based on available information 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as our policy for revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenue on sales to distributors until the products are sold to the end user  however  the application of these policies does not require us to make significant estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
inventory valuation we value inventories at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
because of the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  changes in inventory levels  obsolescence of technology  and product life cycles  we write down inventories to net realizable value 
we employ a variety of methodologies to determine the net realizable value of inventory 
while a portion of the calculation is determined via reference to the age of inventory and lower of cost or market calculations  an element of the calculation is subject to significant judgments made by us about future demand for our inventory 
if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates  additional adjustments to existing inventories may need to be recorded in future periods 
to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates  and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  when appropriate  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
to date our actual results have not been materially different than our estimates  and we do not expect them to be materially different in the future 
long lived assets we review property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
although we have recognized no material impairment adjustments related to our property  plant  and equipment and identified intangible assets during the past three fiscal years  except those made in conjunction with restructuring actions  deterioration in our business in the future could lead to such impairment adjustments in future periods 
evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of our long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
these differences could result in impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on our 
table of contents results of operations 
in addition  in certain instances  assets may not be impaired but their estimated useful lives may have decreased 
in these situations  we amortize the remaining net book values over the revised useful lives 
goodwill in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist and suggest that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable from estimated discounted future cash flows 
because we have one reporting segment under sfas  we utilize the entity wide approach to assess goodwill for impairment and compare our market value to our net book value to determine if an impairment exists 
these impairment tests may result in impairment losses that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  benefits  and deductions  and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes  as well as the interest and penalties relating to these uncertain tax positions 
we assessed the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets and concluded that a valuation allowance is needed to reserve the amount of the deferred tax assets that may not be realized due to the expiration of certain state credit carryovers 
in reaching our conclusion  we evaluated certain relevant criteria including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets  the taxable income in prior carryback years in the impacted state jurisdictions that can be used to absorb net operating losses and taxable income in future years 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made  which in turn  may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
on november  the first day of our fiscal year  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin differs from the prior standards in that it requires companies to determine that it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained by the appropriate taxing authorities before any benefit can be recorded in the financial statements 
an uncertain income tax position is not recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in known facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
a change in these factors would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of cost reimbursement and royalty arrangements among related entities 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
in the event our assumptions are incorrect  the differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
stock based compensation the adoption of sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal required that stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and related awards be recognized in the statement of income  rather than being disclosed in a pro forma footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
determining the amount of stock based 
table of contents compensation to be recorded requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value of stock options 
we calculate the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility we are responsible for estimating volatility and have considered a number of factors  including third party estimates  when estimating volatility 
we currently believe that the exclusive use of implied volatility results in the best estimate of the grant date fair value of employee stock options because it reflects the market s current expectations of future volatility 
in evaluating the appropriateness of exclusively relying on implied volatility  we concluded that options in the company s common stock are actively traded with sufficient volume on several exchanges  the market prices of both the traded options and the underlying shares are measured at a similar point in time to each other and on a date close to the grant date of the employee share options  the traded options have exercise prices that are both near the money and close to the exercise price of the employee share options  and the maturities of the traded options used to estimate volatility are at least one year 
expected term we use historical employee exercise and option expiration data to estimate the expected term assumption for the black scholes grant date valuation 
we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option  and that generally  all of our employees exhibit similar exercise behavior 
in general  the longer the expected term used in the black scholes valuation model  the higher the grant date fair value of the option 
risk free interest rate the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption is used as the risk free interest rate 
expected dividend yield expected dividend yield is calculated by annualizing the cash dividend declared by our board of directors for the current quarter and dividing that result by the closing stock price on the date of grant of the option 
until such time as our board of directors declares a cash dividend for an amount that is different from the current quarter s cash dividend  the current dividend will be used in deriving this assumption 
cash dividends are not paid on options  restricted stock or restricted stock units 
the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the term forfeitures is distinct from cancellations or expirations and represents only the unvested portion of the surrendered option 
based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  we have applied an annual forfeiture rate of to all unvested stock based awards as of november  the rate of represents the portion that is expected to be forfeited each year over the vesting period 
this analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 
contingencies from time to time  we receive notices that our products or manufacturing processes allegedly infringe the patent or intellectual property rights of others 
we periodically assess each matter to determine if a contingent liability should be recorded in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
in making this determination  we may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information we obtain  combined with our judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  we determine whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated 
if a loss is probable and reasonably estimable  we record a contingent loss in accordance with sfas in determining the amount of a contingent loss  we consider advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  settlement negotiations that may be ongoing  prior case history and other factors 
if the judgments and estimates made by us are incorrect  we may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact our results of operations 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding our commitments and contingencies 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate exposure based on our marketable securities and short term investments outstanding as of november  and november   our annual interest income would change by approximately million and million  respectively  for each basis point increase or decrease in interest rates 
the fair values of our investment portfolio at november  and november  would each change by approximately million for each basis point increase or decrease in rates 
foreign currency exposure as more fully described in note i 
in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k  we regularly hedge our non us dollar based exposures by entering into forward foreign currency exchange contracts 
the terms of these contracts are for periods matching the duration of the underlying exposure and generally range from one month to twelve months 
currently  our largest foreign currency exposure is the euro  primarily because our european operations have the highest proportion of our local currency denominated expenses 
relative to foreign currency exposures existing at november  and november   a unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates would not expose us to significant losses in earnings or cash flows because we hedge substantially all of our year end exposures against fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the market risk associated with our derivative instruments results from currency exchange rate or interest rate movements that are expected to offset the market risk of the underlying transactions  assets and liabilities being hedged 
the counterparties to the agreements relating to our foreign exchange instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions with high credit ratings 
we do not believe that there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because we continually monitor the credit ratings of such counterparties  and limit the financial exposure with any one financial institution 
while the contract or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments provide one measure of the volume of these transactions  they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk 
the amounts potentially subject to credit risk arising from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts  if any  by which the counterparties obligations under the contracts exceed our obligations to the counterparties 
the following table illustrates the effect that a unfavorable or favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates  relative to the us dollar  would have on the fair value of our forward exchange contracts as of november  and november  november  november  fair value of forward exchange contracts liability asset fair value of forward exchange contracts after a unfavorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability asset fair value of forward exchange contracts after a favorable movement in foreign currency exchange rates liability the calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  such changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices
