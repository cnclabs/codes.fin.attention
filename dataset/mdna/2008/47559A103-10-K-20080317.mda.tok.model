general the parent company is a bank holding company founded in and headquartered in jeffersonville  new york 
the parent company owns of the outstanding shares of the bank s common stock and derives substantially all of its income from the bank s operations in the form of dividends paid to the parent company 
the bank is a new york commercial bank chartered in serving sullivan county  new york with branch offices in jeffersonville  eldred  liberty  loch sheldrake  monticello two  livingston manor  narrowsburg  callicoon and wurtsboro 
the bank s administrative offices are located in jeffersonville  new york 
the company s mission is to serve the community banking needs of its borrowers and depositors  who predominantly are individuals  small businesses and local municipal governments 
the company believes it understands its local customer needs and provides quality service with a personal touch 
the financial results of the company are influenced by economic events that affect the communities we serve as well as national economic trends  primarily interest rates  affecting the entire banking industry 
changes in net interest income have the greatest impact on the company s net income 
national economic performance for has deteriorated significantly since subprime lending problems have battered large banks and investment companies 
a direct result of this situation is the material drop in market values of new and existing homes 
the cost of energy in has increased over resulting in an all time high cost of gasoline  fuel oil  propane and natural gas 
retail sales levels have dropped despite heavy holiday discounting 
the automobile industry is struggling to stay afloat 
locally  our economy is also suffering 
real estate values are declining as the inventory of unsold homes escalates 
the possibility of casinos revitalizing our local economy has evaporated 
the racino slot machine casino is having financial difficulties 
the construction industry may suffer due to a decline in real estate sales and the growing inventory of existing housing 
lack of commercial growth will also impact the construction industry 
this will in turn create a decline in demand from suppliers of building materials as well as the demand for construction workers 
fortunately the company did not have any subprime mortgages in our loan portfolio or in our investment security holdings 
our overall asset quality remains strong 
management believes the company will weather this economic downturn  as it has survived many others in the past  with sound financial decisions 
critical accounting policies management of the company considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy given the inherent uncertainty in evaluating the levels of the allowance required to cover credit losses in the portfolio and the material effect that such judgments can have on the results of operations 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed adequate by management based on an evaluation of such factors as economic conditions in the company s market area  past loan loss experience  the financial condition of individual borrowers  and underlying collateral values based on independent appraisals 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and values of real estate particularly in sullivan county 
collateral underlying certain real estate loans could lose value which could lead to future additions to the allowance for loan losses 
in addition  federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  which may not be currently available to management

the company is well aware of the economic slow down in the housing market but believes that real estate sales and prices have stabilized in its market area 
the company remains committed to maintaining loan credit quality and sacrificing growth in the loan portfolio 
the overall loan portfolio is structured in accordance with management s belief that loans secured by residential and commercial real estate generally result in lower loan loss levels compared to other types of loans  because of the value of the underlying collateral 
with the denial for the building of a casino in the catskills  the company expects a slow down in the commercial loan area and a possible reduction in loan to asset value in the commercial loan portfolio

results of operations versus net income net income for of million decreased or  from the net income of million 
the lower earnings level in reflects the interaction of a number of factors 
the most significant factor which reduced net income was an increase in deposit interest expense combined with lower earnings on the investment portfolio 
net interest income decreased million from to to million 
increases in loan interest and fees of  to million from million or was offset by decreased security interest income of  decreased holdings in both investment securities and federal funds sold accounted for the bulk of the decrease in earnings 
interest expense increased  primarily due to rising interest rates on deposits as a result of market pressure 
the provision credit for loan losses decreased  to  in primarily as a result of a large recovery as discussed in the summary of loan loss below 
salary and employee benefit expense modestly decreased  or as a result of lower retirement benefit costs  partially offset by normal salary increases and new staff positions 
occupancy and equipment expense increased  other non interest expense increased  due to increased examination fees  fdic assessments and advertising costs associated with the opening of two new branch locations 
interest income and interest expense throughout the following discussion  net interest income and its components are expressed on a tax equivalent basis which means that  where appropriate  tax exempt income is shown as if it were earned on a fully taxable basis 
the largest source of income for the company is net interest income  which represents interest earned on loans  securities and short term investments  less interest paid on deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
tax equivalent net interest income of million for represented a decrease of over net interest margin decreased basis points to in compared to in  due to overall increases in interest bearing liability yields

average residential and commercial real estate loans continued to make up a major portion of the loan portfolio at of total loans in total interest expense in increased million to million from in as a result of an increase in rates paid 
the average balance of interest bearing liabilities decreased from million in to million in  a decrease of as a result of million decrease in average deposits 
matured brokered deposits made up million of the reduction in deposits 
the company expects to continue to reduce its reliance on brokered deposits during during  the average cost of total interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points from to 
average interest bearing deposits decreased million to million in  a decrease of 
interest rates on interest bearing deposits increased by basis points from an average rate paid of in to in savings and insured money market interest rates increased basis points and time deposits increased basis points in response to competition 
in  average demand deposit balances decreased over provision for loan losses the provision credit for loan losses was  in as compared to  in largely as a result of a  recovery on a previously written off loan and loans remaining well secured 
provisions for loan losses are recorded to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level deemed adequate by management based on an evaluation of such factors as economic conditions in the company s market area  past loan loss experience  the financial condition of individual borrowers  and underlying collateral values based on independent appraisals 
the provision for loan losses was reduced in due to the reductions net charge offs as noted below 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions  particularly in sullivan county 
in addition  federal regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses and may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination  which may not be currently available to management 
based on management s comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio  and that the company has no exposure to subprime loans  management believes the current level of the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense 
loans are charged off against the allowance when management believes that the collectibility of all or a portion of the principal is unlikely 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are credited to the allowance when realized 
total nonperforming loans increased million from million at december  to million at december  net loan recoveries charge offs increased from  in to  in and gross charge offs decreased from  in to  in summary of loan loss experience the following table indicates the amount of charge offs and recoveries in the loan portfolio by category

management strives to identify potential nonperforming loans in a timely basis  take charge offs promptly based on a realistic assessment of probable losses  and maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses based on the inherent risk of loss in the existing portfolio 
the provision credit for loan losses was  for the year ended december  compared to  for as disclosed in the company s form k  the company recovered  on a previously written off loan 
this recovery was for a loan made in the loan turned out to be fraudulent and the participants brought a legal suit against the bank of new york 
the participating lenders prevailed and received their settlements in the first quarter of the allowance for loan losses was million at december   million at  and million at the allowance as a percentage of total loans was at december   compared to and at december  and  respectively 
the allowance s coverage of nonperforming loans was at december  compared to and at december  and respectively 
despite the increase in nonperforming loans  recent subprime issues and downturn in local economic conditions  the bank is and has been committed to common sense lending practices  sacrificing loan quantity for quality 
this is reflected in the banks net charge off recovery history in the above table 
now as before  while nonperforming loans have increased  the banks loans remain well collateralized and no specific reserves have been made as management believes the loans will be collected in full 
no portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any loan or group of loans  as the entire allowance is available to absorb charge offs in any loan category 
the amount and timing of future charge offs and allowance allocations may vary from current estimates and will depend on local economic conditions 
the following table shows the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to major portfolio categories and the percentage of each loan category to total loans outstanding 
commercial nonperforming loans are evaluated individually for impairment in accordance with fas as of december   there were  in loans  compared to  as of december   which were considered to be impaired under sfas no

nonaccrual and past due loans the company places a loan on nonaccrual status when collectibility of principal or interest is doubtful  or when either principal or interest is days or more past due and the loan is not well secured and in the process of collection 
interest payments received on nonaccrual loans are applied as a reduction of the principal balance when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal 
a distribution of nonaccrual loans and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest is shown in the following table

the majority of the company s total nonaccrual and past due loans are secured loans and  as such  management anticipates there will be limited risk of loss in their ultimate resolution 
nonaccrual loans increased million from million at december  to million at december  all nonaccrual loans are well collateralized with interest being recognized as received 
from time to time  loans may be renegotiated in a troubled debt restructuring when the company determines that it will ultimately receive greater economic value under the new terms than through foreclosure  liquidation  or bankruptcy 
candidates for renegotiation must meet specific guidelines

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  the company engages in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used by us for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital

liquidity liquidity is the ability to provide sufficient cash flow to meet financial commitments such as additional loan demand and withdrawals of existing deposits 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are its deposit base  fhlb borrowings  repayments and maturities on loans  short term assets such as federal funds and short term interest bearing deposits in banks  and maturities and sales of securities available for sale

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk measuring and managing interest rate risk is a dynamic process that the bank s management must continually perform to meet the objectives of maintaining stable net interest income and net interest margin 
this means that prior to setting the term or interest rate on loans or deposits  or before purchasing investment securities or borrowing funds  management must understand the impact that alternative interest rates will have on the bank s interest rate risk profile 
this is accomplished through simulation modeling 
simulation modeling is the process of shocking the current balance sheet under a variety of interest rate scenarios and then measuring the impact of interest rate changes on both projected earning and the economic value of the bank s equity 
the estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including  but not limited to  the nature and timing of interest rate changes  prepayments on loan and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  and reinvestment replacement rates on asset and liability cash flows 
while assumptions are developed based on available information and current economic and general market conditions  management cannot make any assurance as to the ultimate accuracy of these assumptions including competitive influences and customer behavior 
accordingly  actual results will differ from those predicted by simulation modeling 
the following table shows the projected changes in net interest income from an instantaneous shift in all market interest rates 
the projected changes in net interest income are totals for the month period beginning january  and ending december  under instantaneous shock scenarios 
interest rate sensitivity table dollars in thousands interest rate shock prime rate projected annualized net interest income projected dollar change in net interest income projected percentage change in net interest income projected change in net interest income as a percent of total stockholders equity no change under an instantaneous interest rate shock  interest rates are modeled to change at once 
this is a very conservative modeling technique that illustrates immediate rather than gradual increases or decreases in interest rates 
many assumptions are embedded within our interest rate risk model 
these assumptions are approved by the asset and liability committee and are based upon both management s experience and projections provided by investment securities companies 
assuming our prepayment and other assumptions are accurate and assuming we take reasonable actions to preserve net interest income  we project that net interest income would decline by  or of total stockholders equity in a instantaneous interest rate shock and decline by million or of stockholders equity in a instantaneous interest rate shock 
this is within our asset and liability policy guideline which limits the maximum projected decrease in net interest income in a or instantaneous interest rate shock to of the company s total net interest income 
our strategy for managing interest rate risk is impacted by general market conditions and customer demand 
generally we try to limit the volume and term of fixed rate assets and fixed rate liabilities  so that we can adjust it and pricing of assets and liabilities to mitigate net interest income volatility 
the bank purchases investments for the securities portfolio and borrowings from the fhlb of ny to offset interest rate risk taken in the loan portfolio 
the bank also offers adjustable rate loan and deposit products that change as interest rates change 
approximately of the bank s assets at december  were invested in adjustable rate loans and in floating rate investment securities
