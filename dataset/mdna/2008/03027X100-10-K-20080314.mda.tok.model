item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures in our financial statements 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates beginning at page our continuing operations are reported in two segments  rental and management and network development services 
management focuses on segment gross margin and segment operating profit as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments 
we define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and accretion  selling  general  administrative and development expense  and impairments  net loss on sale of long lived assets  restructuring and merger related expense 
we define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling  general  administrative and development expense attributable to the segment  excluding stock based compensation expense and corporate expenses 
segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the rental and management segment also include interest income  tv azteca  net see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
these measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before interest income  interest expense  loss on retirement of long term obligations  other income expense  minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries  income on equity method investments  income taxes and discontinued operations 
executive overview our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment  which accounted for approximately of our total revenues and approximately of our segment operating profit for the years ended december  and the primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases  leasing additional space on our existing towers  acquiring and building additional tower sites and the degree to which any of our existing customer leases are cancelled 
we continue to believe that our leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity 
in addition  we believe the majority of our leasing activity will continue to come from customers providing wireless broadband services 
the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial term of five to ten years  with multiple five year renewal terms thereafter 
accordingly  nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of december is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods 
in addition  most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease 
these contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage generally three to five percent  inflation  or a fixed percentage plus inflation 
revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight line basis over the non cancelable term of the applicable agreement 
we also routinely seek to extend our tenant leases with our customers  which has the effect of increasing the non cancelable term of the agreement and creating additional stability for our revenues and cash flows 
the revenues generated by our rental and management segment also may be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases 
as discussed above  most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi year contracts  which typically may not be cancelled or  in some instances  may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee 
accordingly  lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment 
during the year ended december   tenant leases representing less than of our total revenues were cancelled 

table of contents a significant majority of our revenue growth in the year ended december  was attributable to incremental revenue generated by our existing communications sites 
during  incremental revenue attributable to those sites that existed during the entire period between january  and december   was approximately million  which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites  existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites  the effects of straight line accounting treatment of contractual escalators in our tenant leases and favorable currency exchange rate changes  offset by lease cancellations 
our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and  to a lesser extent  the location of and available capacity on our existing sites 
this rate  in turn  is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure  the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital  and general economic conditions 
we believe leasing additional space on our existing sites will contribute the substantial majority of our year over year revenue growth in we also generate revenues by building and acquiring new communications sites 
we constructed or acquired and sites in the years ended december  and  respectively 
because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above  our results of operations only reflect revenues generated on these sites following the respective dates of their construction or acquisition  which affects year over year comparisons 
during  incremental revenue attributable to these approximately sites that were built or acquired between january  and december   was approximately million 
we completed our merger with spectrasite  inc  an owner and operator of approximately  wireless and broadcast towers and in building distributed antenna systems in the united states  in august as a result  our results of operations for the years ended december  and differ significantly from our results of operations for the year ended december   because our results of operations for the year ended december  include spectrasite  inc for only the five month period following the merger  whereas our results of operations for the years ended december  and  include spectrasite  inc for each full year period 
our rental and management segment operating expenses include our direct tower level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent  property taxes  repairs and maintenance and utilities 
these segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate  selling  general  administrative and development expenses  which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling  general  administrative and development expense 
our segment level selling  general and administrative expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments  such as sales and property management functions 
in general  our segment level selling  general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites and increase only modestly year over year 
as a result  leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow 
our profit margin growth is  therefore  directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period

the balance of the increase resulted from an increase in network development services revenue of million 
rental and management revenue rental and management revenue for the year ended december  was  million  an increase of million from the year ended december  approximately million of the increase resulted from incremental revenue generated by communications sites that existed during the entire period between january  and december   which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites  existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites  contractual escalators  net of straight line accounting 
table of contents treatment  favorable currency exchange rates and the net increase in straight line revenue from extending the renewal dates of thousands of our tenant leases  partially offset by lease cancellations 
approximately million of the increase resulted from approximately communications sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to january  we believe that our rental and management revenue will grow as we continue to utilize existing site capacity 
we anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers 
network development services revenue network development services revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated by our structural analysis services  related in part to our january acquisition of a structural analysis engineering firm  which enabled us to increase our structural analysis capabilities 
as we continue to focus on and grow our site leasing business  however  we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues 
total operating expenses total operating expenses for the year ended december  were  million  an increase of million from the year ended december  the increase was attributable to an increase in selling  general  administrative and development expense of million  an increase in expenses within our rental and management segment of million  an increase in expenses within our network development services segment of million and an increase in impairments  net loss on sale of long lived assets  restructuring and merger related expense of million 
these increases were offset by a decrease in depreciation  amortization and accretion expense of million 
rental and management expense segment gross margin segment operating profit rental and management expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from the year ended december  approximately million of the increase was attributable to communications sites which existed during the period between january  and december   and approximately million of the increase was related to approximately sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to january  the increase in expenses related to existing towers as of january  resulted primarily from increases in ground rent 
rental and management segment gross margin for the year ended december  was  million  an increase of million from the year ended december  the increase resulted from the additional rental and management revenue described above  partially offset by the increase in rental and management expense 
rental and management segment operating profit for the year ended december  was  million  an increase of million from the year ended december  this was comprised of the million increase in rental and management segment gross margin described above  net of an increase of million in selling  general  administrative and development expenses related to the rental and management segment 
network development services expense network development services expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from the year ended december  the majority of the increase correlates to the growth in services performed as noted above 

table of contents depreciation  amortization and accretion depreciation  amortization and accretion expense for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of million from the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to the finalization in june of the purchase price allocation related to long lived assets acquired in connection with the spectrasite merger  which resulted in decreases in the fair values of certain intangible assets and changes in the estimated useful lives of certain tangible and intangible assets 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included herein  we are in the process of reviewing the estimated useful lives of our tower assets 
we now have over ten years of operating history  and we are considering whether we should modify our current estimates for asset lives based on our historical operating experience 
we have retained an independent consultant to assist us in completing this review  and we received a report from the consultant in the first quarter of  which we are in the process of analyzing 
if we conclude that a revision in the estimated useful lives of our tower assets is appropriate  we will account for any changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting changes and error corrections  which will be recorded prospectively beginning in the period of change 
based on preliminary information obtained to date  we expect that our estimated asset lives may be extended  which would result in prospective decreases in depreciation and amortization  and such changes could be material to future depreciation and amortization and our consolidated results of operations 
selling  general  administrative and development expense selling  general  administrative and development expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million in stock based compensation expense and a decrease of million in costs associated with the legal and governmental proceedings related to the review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting  and other related costs 
see stock option review and related matters below 
stock based compensation expense included million related to the modification of certain stock option awards for two members of senior management who terminated their employment during the year ended december  the remaining million net increase was primarily the result of increases in employee compensation expenses other than stock based compensation expense  primarily related to administrative  information technology and business development activities 
impairments  net loss on sale of long lived assets  restructuring and merger related expense impairments  net loss on sale of long lived assets  restructuring and merger related expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million increase in impairments and net loss on sale of long lived assets 
interest income interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in average interest earning cash balances 
interest expense interest expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an approximately increase in our average outstanding debt  as a result of the debt financing activities described in liquidity and capital resources below and note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 

table of contents loss on retirement of long term obligations during the year ended december   approximately million principal amount of our notes were converted into shares of our class a common stock  and we repurchased pursuant to tender offers approximately million principal amount of our notes and million principal amount of our ati notes 
we also repaid all amounts outstanding under the credit facilities of spectrasite and at the amt opco level and terminated all commitments thereunder 
in addition  we repaid all amounts outstanding under our million senior unsecured term loan credit facility and terminated the loan 
as a result of these transactions  we recorded a charge of million related to amounts paid in excess of the carrying value and the write off of related deferred financing fees 
during the year ended december   approximately million principal amount of our notes were converted into shares of our class a common stock  and we repurchased approximately million principal amount of our ati notes and million principal amount of our notes

for more information regarding our financing activities  see liquidity and capital resources refinancing activities and repurchases of debt below 
other income other income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million of gains recognized on the sale of our common stock investment in fibertower corporation and an increase of million in gains recognized from the mark to market and subsequent settlement of certain interest rate swap agreements 
income tax provision the income tax provision for the year ended december  was million  as compared to million for the year ended december   representing an increase of million from the prior year period 
the effective tax rate was for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the year ended december  differs from the federal statutory rate primarily due to the reversal of million of valuation allowances on net state deferred tax assets offset by a million deferred tax liability recorded in the three months ended december  related to unrealized foreign currency gains on intercompany loans with our brazilian subsidiary 
these items are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
other differences from the federal statutory rate include other foreign items  settlement of tax reserves  non deductible stock based compensation expense  additional tax reserves and state taxes 
the effective tax rate on income from continuing operations for the year ended december  differs from the federal statutory rate due primarily to adjustments to foreign items  non deductible losses on conversions of our notes and state taxes 
in the year ended december   we also received a federal income tax refund from the irs of approximately million  plus million in interest 
the refund resulted from claims by us filed with the irs in june and october  which related to the carry back of net operating losses 

table of contents during the three months ended december   we recorded adjustments to the income tax provision for amounts that should have been recorded in prior reporting periods 
the adjustments were identified in connection with our year end tax analyses and audit of the consolidated financial statements and relate primarily to our cumulative deferred tax assets and liabilities 
recording these out of period adjustments for the three months ended december  had the effect of increasing the income tax provision by million and decreasing income from continuing operations by approximately million inclusive of certain non tax related adjustments see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
loss from discontinued operations  net the loss from discontinued operations  net for the year ended december  included million of net losses related to verestar and million in net gains related to litigation and insurance settlements that were settled for less than the original estimates 
the loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  is primarily due to the settlement of the verestar bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation described in note to our consolidated financial statements included herein and the related tax effects 
in november  following approval by the bankruptcy court  the verestar settlement agreement became effective  we paid the million settlement amount and the litigation was dismissed 
in connection with the approval of the settlement agreement by the bankruptcy court and the dismissal of the bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation  we determined that the benefits from certain of verestar s net operating losses would more likely than not be recoverable by us 
we had not previously recorded these tax benefits related to net operating losses generated from the operations of verestar and used by us because our ability to realize such benefits was potentially impacted by the bankruptcy proceedings and related litigation that had yet to be resolved 
accordingly  in november  we recorded million of additional tax benefits related to verestar 
we also recorded a tax provision of million in loss from discontinued operations  net during the three months ended december  to write off deferred tax assets associated with verestar that should have been written off in and removed from the consolidated balance sheet when verestar was deconsolidated upon its bankruptcy filing in december see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report

stock option review and related matters during the year ended december   our board of directors established a special committee of independent directors to conduct a review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting  as described in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  the special committee found  among other things  that in the past  we had granted options to purchase shares of our class a common stock with exercise prices different from the market price of our stock on the date of grant 
as a result of the special committee s findings  we restated our historical financial statements to  among other things  record charges for stock based compensation expense related to certain option grants and to account for the tax related consequences 
in december  our board of directors approved a remediation plan recommended by the special committee to address the issues raised by its findings 
as part of the remediation plan  we took steps to eliminate any excess benefit received by our current officers and members of the board of directors from options having been granted to them with exercise prices below the market price on the legal grant date 
for outstanding options  this was accomplished by amending each option to increase the exercise price to the fair market value on the legal grant date  without any compensation to the optionholder 
in december  eight of our senior officers and directors amended the exercise prices of options to purchase an aggregate of  shares  thereby 
table of contents eliminating an aggregate excess benefit of approximately million 
for options that had been exercised  this was accomplished by compensating the company for the amount of the excess benefit received upon exercise  after reduction for any taxes paid by the individual 
in january  five of the company s senior officers surrendered vested in the money options to purchase an aggregate of  shares  thereby surrendering an aggregate excess benefit of approximately million net of approximately million in taxes paid by such individuals 
in addition  we took similar steps to eliminate any excess benefit received by certain former officers from the grant to them of options with exercise prices below fair market value on the legal grant date 
in december  january and april  three former officers amended the exercise prices of options to purchase an aggregate of  shares  thereby eliminating an aggregate excess benefit of approximately million  and surrendered vested in the money options to purchase an aggregate of  shares  thereby surrendering an aggregate excess benefit  net of taxes paid by such individuals  of approximately million 
in addition  we determined that under section a of the internal revenue code section a  options that were granted with exercise prices below the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant and that vest after december  would likely be subject to unfavorable tax consequences that did not apply at the time of grant 
in order to compensate our non executive employees who previously exercised affected options and already incurred taxes and penalties under section a  we paid approximately million on behalf of such individuals for these taxes during the year ended december  in order to remedy the unfavorable personal tax consequences of section a on holders of outstanding options  we conducted a tender offer in december for the affected options  pursuant to which we offered to amend the affected options to increase the option exercise price to the market price on the revised grant date  and to give the option holders excluding officers and directors a cash payment for the difference in option exercise price between the amended option and the original price 
we accounted for the financial impact of the tender offer as a stock option modification under sfas no 
r resulting in an increase to stock based compensation expense and additional paid in capital of million in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  and an additional million recognized for the year ended december  following completion of the tender offer  in january  we paid an aggregate of approximately million in cash to holders of options that were amended in the tender offer 
as discussed above in item of this annual report under the caption legal proceedings  we have received a letter of informal inquiry from the sec  a subpoena from the office of the united states attorney for the eastern district of new york  information document requests from the irs and requests for information from the department of labor  each requesting documents and information related to our stock option granting practices 
in addition  we and certain of our current and former officers and directors are defendants in lawsuits related to our historical stock option granting practices 
in connection with the review of our historical stock option granting practices  the restatement of our historical financial statements and the related legal and governmental proceedings  we have incurred significant legal  accounting and auditing expenses  and we expect to continue to incur legal expenditures in the future

contractual obligations 
our contractual obligations relate primarily to the commercial mortgage pass through certificates  series issued in the securitization  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  our outstanding notes and our operating leases related to the ground under our towers

interest rates for the revolving credit facility are determined at our option and range between and above the applicable london interbank offering rate libor for libor based borrowings or between and above the defined base rate for base rate borrowings  in each case based on our debt ratings 
a quarterly commitment fee on the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility is required  ranging from to per annum  based on our debt ratings 
as discussed in item a 
quantitative and 
table of contents qualitative disclosures about market risk  we have entered into swap agreements to manage exposure to variable rate interest obligations under the revolving credit facility 
as a result of these swap agreements  the effective weighted average interest rate in effect at december  for the revolving credit facility was 
for projections of our cash interest expense related to the revolving credit facility  we have assumed the libor rate before the margin  as defined in the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility  is through its maturity on june  operating lease payments include payments to be made under non cancelable initial terms  as well as payments for certain renewal periods at our option because failure to renew could result in a loss of the applicable tower site and related revenues from tenant leases  thereby making it reasonably assured that we will renew the lease 
primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet  primarily our straight line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash 
other long term liabilities exclude million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled 
settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations 
as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted fin as of january  which resulted in the classification of uncertain tax positions as non current income tax liabilities 
we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe 
however  based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements  we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes  if any  to previously recorded uncertain tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k

the certificates were issued by american tower trust i the trust  a trust established by american tower depositor sub  llc the depositor  one of our indirect wholly owned special purpose subsidiaries 
the assets of the trust consist of a recourse loan the loan initially made by the depositor to american tower asset sub  llc and american tower asset sub ii  llc the borrowers  pursuant to a loan and security agreement among the foregoing parties dated as of may  the loan agreement 
the borrowers are special purpose entities formed solely for the purpose of holding the towers subject to the securitization 
as indicated in the table below  the certificates were issued in seven separate classes 
each of the class b  class c  class d  class e and class f certificates are subordinated in right of payment to any other class of certificates which has an earlier alphabetical designation 
the certificates were issued with terms identical to the loan except for the class a fl certificates  which bear interest at a floating rate while the related component of the loan bears interest at a fixed rate  as described below 
the various classes of certificates were issued with a weighted average interest rate of approximately 
the certificates have an expected life of approximately seven years with a final repayment date in april class initial class principal balance interest rate rating moody s fitch s p class a fx  aaa aaa aaa class a fl  libor a aaa aaa aaa class b  aa aa aa class c  a a a class d  baa bbb bbb class e  baa bbb bbb class f  baa bbb bb a the class a fl certificates bear interest at a floating rate based on libor  but interest on the related component of the loan is computed at a fixed rate equal to the interest rate on the class a fx certificates 
holders of the class a fl certificates have the benefit of an interest rate swap agreement between the trust and morgan stanley capital services inc neither we nor the borrowers have any obligations or liability with respect to this interest rate swap agreement 
we used the net proceeds from the securitization to repay all amounts outstanding under the spectrasite credit facilities  including approximately million in principal  plus accrued interest thereon and other costs and expenses related thereto  as well as to repay approximately million drawn under the revolving loan component of the amt opco credit facilities 
an additional million of the proceeds was used to fund our 
table of contents tender offer and consent solicitation for our ati notes  and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes 
we also funded million in cash reserve accounts with proceeds from the securitization as required under the loan agreement 
the loan will be paid by the borrowers solely from the cash flows generated by the towers 
these funds in turn will be used by or on behalf of the trust to service the payment of interest on the certificates and for any other payments required by the loan agreement

senior notes offering 
in october  we completed an institutional private placement of million aggregate principal amount of our notes 
the net proceeds from the offering were approximately million  which we used  together with cash on hand  to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness incurred under our million term loan 
we terminated the term loan upon repayment 
the notes mature on october   and interest is payable semiannually in arrears on april and october of each year  commencing on april   to the persons in whose names the notes are registered at the close of business on the preceding april and october  respectively 
we may redeem the notes at any time 
the redemption price on the notes is of the principal amount  plus a make whole premium  together with accrued interest to the redemption date 
interest on the notes will accrue from the date of issuance and will be computed on the basis of a day year comprised of twelve day months 

table of contents if we undergo a change of control and ratings decline  each as defined in the indenture for the notes  we may be required to repurchase all of the notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  and additional interest  if any  to but not including the date of repurchase 
the notes rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured debt and are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries 
the indenture contains certain covenants that restrict our ability to incur more subsidiary debt or permit subsidiaries to provide guarantees  create liens  and merge  consolidate or sell assets 
these covenants are subject to a number of exceptions  including that our restricted subsidiaries may incur certain indebtedness  and that we and our subsidiaries may incur liens securing indebtedness  if the aggregate amount of such indebtedness and such liens shall not exceed x adjusted ebitda as defined in the indenture 
for more information regarding the notes  please see note to our consolidated financial statements herein 
convertible notes conversions 
during the year ended december   we issued an aggregate of  shares of our class a common stock upon conversion of approximately million principal amount of notes 
pursuant to the terms of the indenture  the holders of the notes are entitled to receive shares of class a common stock for every  principal amount of notes converted 
in connection with the conversion  we paid such holders an aggregate of approximately million  calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes as of the date of conversion and the discounted value of the future interest payments on the notes 
as of december   million principal amount of notes remained outstanding 
convertible notes tender offer 
in february  we conducted a cash tender offer for our outstanding notes 
the tender offer was intended to satisfy the rights granted to each noteholder under the indenture for the notes to require us to repurchase on february  all or any part of such holder s notes at a price equal to the issue price plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  up to but excluding february  under the terms of the notes  we had the option to pay for the notes with cash  class a common stock  or a combination of cash and stock 
we elected to pay for the notes solely with cash 
pursuant to the tender offer  we repurchased an aggregate of million principal amount of notes for an aggregate of million 
upon completion of this tender offer and as of december   million principal amount of notes remained outstanding 
ati notes tender offer and consent solicitation 
in april  we commenced a cash tender offer and consent solicitation with respect to our outstanding ati notes 
in may  we received tenders and consents of approximately or million of the million principal amount of ati notes outstanding  and elected to accept for payment all ati notes that had been properly tendered and not withdrawn  together with the related consents 
accordingly  we paid million  including approximately million in accrued and unpaid interest  to holders of ati notes using net proceeds from the securitization discussed above 
in connection with the tender offer and consent solicitation  we entered into a supplemental indenture effecting certain amendments to the indenture for the notes to eliminate most of the restrictive covenants and certain events of default and to eliminate or modify related provisions 
as of december   million principal amount of ati notes remained outstanding 
termination of interest rate swap agreements 
during the year ended december   we received cash of approximately million upon net settlement of certain of our assets and liabilities under interest rate swap agreements held as of december  and entered into during the first half of  as discussed below 
in addition  we paid million related to a treasury rate lock agreement entered into and settled during the three months ended september   as discussed below 
we received million in cash upon settlement of the assets and liabilities under ten forward starting interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of billion  which were designated as cash flow hedges to manage exposure to variability in cash flows relating to forecasted interest payments in connection with the certificates issued in the securitization in 
table of contents may as a result  the settlement gain of million  net of a tax benefit of million  is being recognized as a reduction in interest expense over the five year period for which the interest rate swaps were designated as hedges 
we also received million in cash upon settlement of our assets and liabilities under additional interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million that managed exposure to variability of interest rates under the spectrasite credit facilities and amt opco credit facilities 
we recognized a net gain on these terminations of million  which is included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  we paid million in cash upon settlement of a treasury rate lock agreement with an aggregate notional amount of million entered into in anticipation of the issuance of fixed rate debt 
we terminated this treasury rate lock agreement during the year ended december  in connection with the pricing of our notes and are recognizing the settlement amount  net of tax as an increase in interest expense over the year term of the notes 
factors affecting sources of liquidity internally generated funds 
because the majority of our tenant leases are multi year contracts  a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods 
accordingly  a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it to operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies 
in addition  our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for antenna space on wireless and broadcast communications towers and for related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing towers 
restrictions under revolving credit facility 
the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility contains certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries designated as restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
these include limitations on additional debt  distributions and dividends  guaranties  sales of assets and liens  as well as the following three financial maintenance tests a consolidated total leverage ratio total debt to adjusted ebitda of not greater than to  a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda of not greater than to  and an interest coverage ratio adjusted ebitda to interest expense of not less than to 
as of december   we were in compliance with each of the foregoing financial tests 
the loan agreement also contains reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods 
if we are unable to timely provide the required information  we would be in breach of these covenants 
any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the facility  but would constitute a default  which could result in  among other things  the amounts outstanding  including all accrued interest and unpaid fees  becoming immediately due and payable 
restrictions under loan agreement relating to our securitization 
the loan agreement related to our securitization includes operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations 
among other things  our two special purpose subsidiaries that are borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets 
the organizational documents of the borrowers contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special purpose entities  including the requirement that the borrowers maintain at least two independent directors 
the loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the borrowers to provide the trustee with regular 
table of contents financial reports and operating budgets  promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the securitization  and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers  including the right to conduct site investigations 
failure to comply with the covenants in the loan agreement related to the securitization could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers  and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of the towers to us 
if the borrowers were to default on the loan related to the securitization  the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization  in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers 
restrictions under notes indentures 
the indentures governing the terms of our notes and notes also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and the restricted subsidiaries under these indentures must comply 
these include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt  guarantee debt  pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments 
with the exception of spectrasite and its subsidiaries  most of our operating subsidiaries are designated as restricted subsidiaries under these note indentures 
in addition  certain of spectrasite s subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that they can distribute to us under the loan agreement for the securitization  as discussed above 
any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default 
specifically  these indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than times our adjusted consolidated cash flow 
the indentures also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods 
if we are unable to timely provide the required information  we would be in breach of these covenants 
if a default occurred under the loan agreement related to the securitization  the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility or the indentures for our other debt securities  the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated  and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility until we cured the default 
if this were to occur  we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness 
the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and our ability to fund our debt service obligations 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 
as of december   our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations principal and interest for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately million  million  million  million  billion and billion  respectively 
in addition  as a holding company  we depend on distributions from our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through credit facilities and debt and equity offerings to fund our debt obligations 
although the agreements governing the terms of the loan agreement related to the securitization permit certain of spectrasite s subsidiaries to make distributions to us  such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us 
accordingly  if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations  we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt  and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations  will depend on our future financial performance  which is subject to many factors beyond our control  as outlined above in item a of this annual report under the caption risk factors 
in addition  our ability to raise capital in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies  which are dependent on our expected financial performance  the liquidity factors discussed above  and the rating agencies outlook for our industry 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete such financings or  if such financings are completed  that the terms will be commercially reasonable 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to income taxes  asset retirement obligations  stock based compensation  impairment of assets  revenue recognition and estimated useful lives of assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december  of the critical accounting policies described in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   we no longer consider the purchase price allocation as a critical accounting policy or estimate  as the spectrasite purchase price allocation was finalized in june as discussed below  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
fin as of january   which requires significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position 
changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently  affect our operating results 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
accordingly  we have added additional considerations related to fin and our state deferred tax valuation allowances in our critical accounting policy related to income taxes  as noted in the following paragraphs 
in addition  we have added estimated useful lives of assets as a critical accounting policy for the year ended december  except for the deletion of the purchase price allocation  adoption of fin and changes in our deferred state tax valuation allowances  and the addition of estimated useful lives of assets during the year ended december   we have not made any changes to the policies in place at december  we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
for a discussion of our other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  beginning on page f income taxes 
fin prescribes a more likely than not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities  classification of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions  accounting for income taxes in interim periods and income tax disclosures 
the cumulative effect of applying this interpretation was recorded as an increase of million to accumulated deficit  an increase of million to prepaid and other current assets and an increase of million to long term deferred tax assets  with a corresponding increase in other long term liabilities of million in the consolidated balance sheet as of january  we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with fin  and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
if the tax 
table of contents liabilities relate to tax uncertainties existing at the date of the acquisition of a business  the adjustment of such tax liabilities will result in an adjustment to the goodwill recorded at the date of acquisition 
we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe 
however  based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements  we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes  if any  to previously recorded uncertain tax positions and have classified approximately million as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  we also classified approximately million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  requires that companies record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we periodically review our deferred tax assets  and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
during the year ended december   we completed an analysis of the valuation allowances on our state deferred tax assets 
we undertook this analysis as a result of several factors  including the fact that we had experienced several successive quarters of net income  we had restructured certain of our legal entities primarily related to the securitization  and we had completed a number of capital raising and debt refinancing transactions during the year ended december  we had previously recorded a full valuation allowance on our net state deferred tax assets  as we considered that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
however  upon completion of our analysis during the year ended december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of these net state deferred tax assets would be realized 
as a result  we recognized approximately million of additional state deferred tax assets net of a federal tax provision  which were recorded as an income tax benefit and a corresponding increase in long term deferred income taxes in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we will continue to assess the realization of our deferred tax assets and liabilities on an ongoing basis 
as of december   we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately million  including approximately million attributable to spectrasite  primarily related to certain net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards assumed as of the acquisition date 
the balance of the valuation allowance primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards  capital losses and foreign items 
we have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets  primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards  as we believe that we will have sufficient time to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty year tax carryforward period 
valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability 
approximately million of the spectrasite valuation allowances as of december  will be recorded as a reduction to goodwill if the underlying deferred tax assets are utilized 
in april  we recovered a portion of our deferred tax asset when we received a federal income tax refund of approximately million  plus million in interest related to the carry back of certain federal net operating losses  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 

table of contents the recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations 
the projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period 
accordingly  the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations  material asset sales or other non routine transactions 
based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period  management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized 
the realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately billion and billion in federal and state taxable income  respectively  from january  to december  if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above  we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our international operations 
from time to time  we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations  and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million income tax provision to reflect a reduction in management s estimate of the net realizable value of our federal tax refund claims as described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through december  depending on the resolution of the verestar bankruptcy proceedings described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we may be entitled to a worthless stock or bad debt deduction for our investment in verestar 
we will record any income tax benefit for these potential deductions when the plan of liquidation is finalized and approved by the bankruptcy court 
asset retirement obligations 
we comply with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
and the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
both pronouncements address the financial accounting and reporting requirements for conditional obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long lived assets and the related asset retirement costs  principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located 
under these accounting principles  we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred  if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made  and we accrete such liability through the obligation s estimated settlement date 
the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life 
during the years ended december  and  we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation  which resulted in a net decrease in the estimated obligation of million and million  respectively 
the primary reasons for the decrease in was a result of changes in timing of certain settlement date assumptions  and the purchase of land underlying ground leases 
during the year ended december   we also adopted the provisions of fin and recognized a million charge net of an million tax benefit as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  the adoption of fin primarily resulted in the acceleration of our settlement date assumptions  as fin precludes us from considering non contractual lease renewal periods in determining our settlement date assumptions 
fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement 
table of contents obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows  and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense 
the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals  cost of tower removals  timing and number of land lease renewals  expected inflation rates  and credit adjusted risk free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate 
while we feel the assumptions are appropriate  there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates 
we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options and employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans 
sfas no 
r supersedes the company s previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

under sfas no 
r  we are no longer permitted to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb no 
described below 
instead  we are required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the related expense associated with share based payments in the statement of operations 
we adopted sfas no 
r under the modified prospective method  pursuant to which compensation expense for all share based payments granted or modified after the effective date is recognized based upon the requirements of sfas no 
r 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated related to the adoption of sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r primarily resulted in a change in our method of measuring and recognizing the fair value of option awards and estimating forfeitures for all unvested awards 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize stock based compensation awards granted to employees as compensation expense on a fair value method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
the expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited 
under sfas no 
r  the fair value of the stock option is determined using a black scholes option pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date  the exercise price  the expected life of the option  the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends  and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option 
these assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the pro forma compensation expense 
under sfas no 
r  the fair value of the stock option is determined in the same manner as the pro forma compensation cost under sfas no 
and adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
under apb no 
 the company previously recorded the impact of forfeitures as they occurred 
in november  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards fas r 
effective upon issuance  this fsp describes an alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of stock based compensation to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and the statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas no 
r 
during the year ended december   we elected the long method  as defined in the fas r in addition  in accordance with sfas no 
r  sfas no 
and eitf topic d  intraperiod tax allocation of the tax effect of pretax income from continuing operations  we have elected to recognize excess income tax benefits from stock option exercises in additional paid in capital only if an incremental income tax benefit would be realized after considering all other tax attributes presently available to us 
we measure the tax benefit associated with excess tax deductions related to stock based compensation expense by multiplying the excess tax deductions by the statutory tax rates 

table of contents prior to january   we measured compensation expense for our stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb no 
under the intrinsic value method  compensation expense associated with fixed awards is the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock at the accounting measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
under apb no 
 compensation expense is measured as of the date an award has received approval by relevant authority  the number of shares and exercise price are fixed and allocation to specific individuals has occurred 
generally  this occurs on the date the grant is approved by the compensation committee of our board of directors  or  if grant authority has been delegated to management  when the shares are allocated to specific individuals 
the stock based compensation expense for an award is recognized over the vesting period using the ratable method  whereby an equal amount of expense is recognized for each year of vesting 
the actual accounting measurement dates determined in the course of our recent review of our historical stock option granting practices are based on a review of supporting approval documentation and other extrinsic evidence of awards 
during the year ended december   we re evaluated the assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options issued to employees and related disclosure of pro forma expense required under sfas no 
as a result  we lowered our expected volatility assumption for options granted after july  to approximately and increased the expected life of option grants to years using the simplified method permitted by sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment sab no 

we made this change based on a number of factors  including our execution of our strategic plans to sell non core businesses  reduce leverage and our merger with spectrasite  inc we had previously based our volatility assumptions on historical volatility since inception  which included periods when our capital structure was more highly leveraged than current levels and expected levels for the foreseeable future 
our estimate of future volatility is based on our consideration of all available information  including historical volatility  implied volatility of publicly traded options  our current capital structure and our publicly announced future business plans 
impairment of assets 
assets subject to depreciation and amortization and non core long lived assets held for sale we review long lived assets  including intangibles  for impairment whenever events  changes in circumstances or our review of our tower portfolio indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our tower portfolio review includes sites for which we have no current tenant leases and towers for which expenses exceed revenues 
we assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows or anticipated proceeds from sales of the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset s fair market value as compared to its carrying value 
we record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment 
we also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on management s best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition 
we record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss 
goodwill assets not subject to amortization we perform our annual goodwill impairment test on december of each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
in december  and  we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of our rental and management segment and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information  changes to which could affect those fair value estimates 
our december and annual impairment testing included approximately billion of goodwill acquired in our merger with spectrasite  inc revenue recognition 
rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned  regardless of whether the payments from the customer are 
table of contents received in equal monthly amounts 
fixed escalation clauses present in non cancelable lease agreements  excluding those tied to the consumer price index cpi or other inflation based indices  and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable leases 
straight line revenues for the years ended december   and approximated million  million and million  respectively 
amounts billed up front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases 
amounts billed or received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until such time as the earnings process is complete 
estimated useful lives of assets 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements included herein  we are in the process of reviewing the estimated useful lives of our tower assets 
we now have over ten years of operating history  and we are considering whether we should modify our current estimates for asset lives based on our historical operating experience 
we have retained an independent consultant to assist us in completing this review  and we received a report from the consultant in the first quarter of  which we are in the process of analyzing 
we currently depreciate towers on leased land on a straight line basis over the shorter of the term of the underlying ground lease including renewal options or the estimated useful life of the tower  which we have historically estimated to be years 
additionally  certain of our intangible assets are amortized on a similar basis as our tower assets  as the estimated useful lives of such intangibles correlate to the useful life of the towers 
if we conclude a revision in the estimated useful lives of our tower assets is appropriate  we will account for any changes in the useful lives as a change in accounting estimate under sfas no 
accounting changes and error corrections  which will be recorded prospectively beginning in the period of change 
based on preliminary information obtained to date  we expect that our estimated asset lives may be extended which would result in prospective decreases in depreciation and amortization  and such changes could be material to future depreciation and amortization and our consolidated results of operations

information presented pursuant to the indentures of our notes and notes the following table sets forth information that is presented solely to address certain tower cash flow reporting requirements contained in the indentures for our notes and notes 
the indentures governing our notes and notes contain restrictive covenants with which we and certain subsidiaries under these indentures must comply 
these include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt  guarantee debt  pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments 
any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default  which could result in the acceleration of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on all our outstanding notes and notes 
in order for the holders of these notes to assess our compliance with certain of these covenants  the indentures require us to disclose in the periodic reports we file with the sec our tower cash flow  adjusted consolidated cash flow and non tower cash flow each as defined in the indentures 
under the indentures  our ability to make certain types of restricted payments is limited by the amount of adjusted consolidated cash flow that we generate  which is determined based on our tower cash flow and non tower cash flow 
in addition  the indentures for our notes and notes restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock if on a pro forma basis the issuance of such debt and preferred stock would cause our consolidated debt to be greater than times our adjusted consolidated cash flow
