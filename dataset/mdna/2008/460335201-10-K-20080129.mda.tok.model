starting in fiscal  entitlement of two of nascar s premiere series will change 
the nascar nextel cup series will become the nascar sprint cup series and the nascar busch series will become the nascar nationwide series 
throughout this document  the naming convention for these series is consistent with the branding in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while our estimates and assumptions are based on conditions existing at and trends leading up to the time the estimates and assumptions are made  actual results could differ materially from those estimates and assumptions 
we continually review our accounting policies  how they are applied and how they are reported and disclosed in the financial statements 
the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates and how they are applied in the preparation of the financial statements 
basis of presentation and consolidation 
we consolidate all entities we control by ownership of a majority voting interest 
also  if we ever have variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary  we will consolidate those entities 
our judgment in determining if we are the primary beneficiary of a variable page 
table of contents interest entity includes assessing our level of involvement in establishing the entity  determining whether we provide more than half of any management  operational or financial support to the entity  and determining if we absorb the majority of the entity s expected losses or returns 
we apply the equity method of accounting for our investments in joint ventures and other investees whenever we can exert significant influence on the investee but do not have effective control over the investee 
our consolidated net income includes our share of the net earnings or losses from these investees 
our judgment regarding the level of influence over each equity method investee includes considering factors such as our ownership interest  board representation and policy making decisions 
we periodically evaluate these equity investments for potential impairment where a decline in value is determined to be other than temporary 
we eliminate all significant intercompany transactions from financial results 
revenue recognition 
advance ticket sales and event related revenues for future events are deferred until earned  which is generally once the events are conducted 
the recognition of event related expenses is matched with the recognition of event related revenues 
nascar contracts directly with certain network providers for television rights to the entire nascar nextel cup and busch series schedules as well as the nascar craftsman truck series schedule beginning in fiscal year event promoters share in the television rights fees in accordance with the provision of the sanction agreement for each nascar nextel cup  busch and craftsman truck series event 
under the terms of this arrangement  nascar retains percent of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to each nascar nextel cup  busch and craftsman truck series event as a component of its sanction fees and remits the remaining percent to the event promoter 
the event promoter pays percent of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to the event as part of awards to the competitors 
our revenues from marketing partnerships are paid in accordance with negotiated contracts  with the identities of partners and the terms of sponsorship changing from time to time 
some of our marketing partnership agreements are for multiple facilities and or events and include multiple specified elements  such as tickets  hospitality chalets  suites  display space and signage for each included event 
the allocation of such marketing partnership revenues between the multiple elements  events and facilities is based on relative fair value 
the sponsorship revenue allocated to an event is recognized when the event is conducted 
revenues and related costs from the sale of merchandise to retail customers  internet sales and direct sales to dealers are recognized at the time of sale 
accounts receivable 
we regularly review the collectability of our accounts receivable 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on historical experience of write offs and future expectations of conditions that might impact the collectability of accounts 
business combinations 
all business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method 
whether net assets or common stock is acquired  fair values are determined and assigned to the purchased assets and assumed liabilities of the acquired entity 
the excess of the cost of the acquisition over fair value of the net assets acquired including recognized intangibles is recorded as goodwill 
business combinations involving existing motorsports entertainment facilities commonly result in a significant portion of the purchase price being allocated to the fair value of the contract based intangible asset associated with long term relationships manifest in the sanction agreements with sanctioning bodies  such as nascar  grand american and or irl 
the continuity of sanction agreements with these bodies has historically enabled the facility operator to host motorsports events year after year 
while individual sanction agreements may be of terms as short as one year  a significant portion of the purchase price in excess of the fair value of acquired tangible assets is commonly paid to acquire anticipated future cash flows from events promoted pursuant to these agreements which are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and therefore  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 are recorded as indefinite lived page 
table of contents intangible assets recognized apart from goodwill 
capitalization and depreciation policies 
property and equipment are stated at cost 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation and amortization for financial statement purposes are provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
when we construct assets  we capitalize costs of the project  including  but not limited to  certain pre acquisition costs  permitting costs  fees paid to architects and contractors  certain costs of our design and construction subsidiary  property taxes and interest 
we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures 
whether an expenditure is considered an operating expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment 
when constructing or purchasing assets  we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired  which also is a matter of judgment 
our depreciation expense for financial statement purposes is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives 
we determine the estimated useful lives based upon our experience with similar assets  industry  legal and regulatory factors  and our expectations of the usage of the asset 
whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset  we account for the change prospectively 
interest costs associated with major development and construction projects are capitalized as part of the cost of the project 
interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended using the weighted average cost of our outstanding borrowings  since we typically do not borrow funds directly related to a development or construction project 
we capitalize interest on a project when development or construction activities begin and cease when such activities are substantially complete or are suspended for more than a brief period 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
our consolidated balance sheets include significant amounts of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
our intangible assets are comprised of assets having finite useful lives  which are amortized over that period  and goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
current accounting standards require testing these assets for impairment  either upon the occurrence of an impairment indicator or annually  based on assumptions regarding our future business outlook 
while we continue to review and analyze many factors that can impact our business prospects in the future  our analyses are subjective and are based on conditions existing at  and trends leading up to  the time the estimates and assumptions are made 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates and assumptions 
our judgments with regard to our future business prospects could impact whether or not an impairment is deemed to have occurred  as well as the timing of the recognition of such an impairment charge 
our equity method investees also perform such tests for impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
self insurance reserves 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including general liability  workers compensation  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits 
liabilities associated with the risks that we retain are estimated by considering various historical trends and forward looking assumptions related to costs  claim counts and payments 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends 
income taxes 
the tax law requires that certain items be included in our tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses not deductible on our tax return 
however  some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense  and these temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
our estimates of deferred income taxes and the significant items giving rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in our financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability of realization 
actual income taxes could vary significantly from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or changes or adjustments page 
table of contents resulting from final review of our tax returns by taxing authorities  which could also adversely impact our cash flow 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
we recognize probable liabilities for tax audit issues  including interest and penalties  based on an estimate of the ultimate resolution of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
although we believe the estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than what is reflected in the historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have an impact on the income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made 
contingent liabilities 
our determination of the treatment of contingent liabilities in the financial statements is based on our view of the expected outcome of the applicable contingency 
in the ordinary course of business we consult with legal counsel on matters related to litigation and other experts both within and outside our company 
we accrue a liability if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose the matter but do not accrue a liability if either the likelihood of an adverse outcome is only reasonably possible or an estimate of loss is not determinable 
legal and other costs incurred in conjunction with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 
acquisition and divestitures raceway associates on february   we acquired the percent ownership interested in raceway associates  llc raceway associates we did not previously own  bringing our ownership to percent 
raceway associates operates chicagoland and route the purchase price for the percent ownership interest totaled approximately million  including approximately million paid to the prior owners  the assumption of third party liabilities and acquisition costs  net of cash received 
the purchase price was paid with cash on hand and approximately million in borrowings on our revolving credit facility 
this transaction has been accounted for as a business combination and is included in our consolidated operations subsequent to the date of acquisition 
we believe that chicagoland and route are uniquely attractive assets well positioned in the nation s third largest media market with a strong motorsports fan base 
the purchase price for the raceway associates acquisition was preliminarily allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair market values at the acquisition date 
included in this acquisition are certain indefinite lived intangible assets attributable to the sanction agreements in place at the time of acquisition and goodwill 
nazareth speedway after the completion of nazareth speedway s nazareth fiscal events we suspended indefinitely its major motorsports event operations 
the nascar busch series and irl indycar series events  then conducted at nazareth  were realigned to other motorsports entertainment facilities within our portfolio 
in january  we entered into an agreement with nzsw  llc for the sale of acres  on which nazareth speedway is located  for approximately million 
on october   we terminated our agreement with nzsw  llc in accordance with its terms as a result of a default by nzsw  llc 
the property continues to be marketed and a sale is expected to occur in fiscal for all periods presented  the results of operations of nazareth are presented as discontinued operations

table of contents impairment of long lived assets northwest us speedway development since  we had been pursuing development of a motorsports entertainment facility in kitsap county  washington  which required state legislation to help finance the project 
in early this legislation was introduced in both the washington state house of representatives and senate 
on april   we announced that despite agreeing to substantial changes to the required legislation it had become apparent that additional modifications would be proposed to the bill 
due to the increased risk that the collective modifications would have a significant negative impact on the project s financial model  we felt it was in our best long term interest to discontinue our efforts at the site 
as a result  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge in fiscal of approximately million  or per diluted share after tax  to reflect the write off of certain capitalized costs including legal  consulting  capitalized interest and other project specific costs 
the charge is included in impairment of long lived assets in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended november  we still believe the pacific northwest represents an attractive long term opportunity  and remain interested in a motorsports entertainment facility development project in the region 
new york metropolitan speedway development in september we ceased fill operations at our staten island real property while we addressed the issues raised in communications from the dec and dos  including the presence of  and potential need to remediate  fill containing constituents above regulatory thresholds 
in may  we entered into a consent order with the dec to resolve the issues surrounding these fill operations and the prior placement of fill at the site that contained constituents above regulatory thresholds 
the consent order requires us to remove non compliant fill pursuant to an approved comprehensive fill removal plan 
we commenced fill removal activities in september  and we expect the fill removal to be complete in the first quarter of fiscal the consent order also required us to pay a penalty to dec of  half of which was paid in may and the other half of which has been suspended so long as we comply with the terms of the consent order 
included in impairment of long lived assets in our consolidated statements of operations at november   is our estimated total costs  including the portion of the penalty which has been paid  attributable to the expected fill removal process of approximately million  respectively  or per diluted share  respectively 
we continue to evaluate the existence of other responsible parties and potential recoveries from such parties  if any 
we expect to resume fill operations within the next several months after complying with the consent order and once other appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained 
the property is currently marketed for sale and we are confident that  on a timely basis  we will agree to terms with a buyer 
although we are disappointed that our speedway development efforts were unsuccessful on staten island  we still have an interest in pursuing the development of a motorsports entertainment facility in the region 
due to the considerable interest in and support for nascar racing in the metro new york market  we believe a premier motorsports entertainment facility will have a significant positive impact on the area s economy and prove to be a long term community asset 
equity and other investments motorsports authentics in the fourth quarter of fiscal we partnered with smi in a joint venture  smisc  llc  which  through its wholly owned subsidiary motorsports authentics  llc conducts business under the name motorsports authentics 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal  motorsports authentics acquired team caliber and action performance  inc  respectively  and became a leader in design  promotion  marketing and distribution of motorsports licensed merchandise 
although page 
table of contents motorsports authentics made significant progress towards integrating the companies and improving its business operations  in order to accelerate this improvement and more effectively position itself for long term success it hired a new president and chief executive officer in june under this new leadership  motorsports authentics is making important changes to the business and has finalized its plans for fiscal as a result of certain significant driver and team changes and excess merchandise on hand  motorsports authentics recognized a write down of certain inventory and related assets in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal motorsports authentics completed forward looking strategic financial planning 
the resulting financial projections were utilized in its annual valuation analysis of goodwill  certain intangible assets and other long lived assets which resulted in an impairment charge on such assets 
our percent portion of motorsports authentics fiscal net loss is approximately million  or per diluted share  which includes the aforementioned inventory and related asset write down of approximately million  or per diluted share  and impairment charges of approximately million  or per diluted share  included in equity in net loss from equity investments in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended november  while we were disappointed in the fiscal results from motorsports authentics  at the present time we continue to believe the sale of licensed merchandise represents a significant opportunity in the sport and are confident that the current management at motorsports authentics has developed a solid plan for the future 
limited partnership agreement in october we entered into a limited partnership agreement with group motoris international gmi to organize  promote and hold certain racing events at circuit gilles villeneuve  including a nascar busch series and grand american rolex sports car series presented by crown royal special reserve race weekend  in the third quarter of fiscal circuit gilles villeneuve is a road course located in montr al  quebec  at which gmi currently promotes a successful f canadian grand prix event 
the agreement did not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations in fiscal stock purchase plan in december we announced that our board of directors had authorized the stock purchase plan under which we could purchase up to million of our outstanding class a common shares 
in july  our board of directors authorized a million increase to the stock purchase plan allowing us to purchase up to a total of million of our outstanding class a common shares through november  the timing and amount of any shares repurchased under the stock purchase plan will depend on a variety of factors  including price  corporate and regulatory requirements  capital availability and other market conditions 
the stock purchase plan may be suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
no shares have been or will be knowingly purchased from company insiders or their affiliates 
during fiscal  we purchased  shares of our class a common shares  at an average cost of approximately per share including commissions  for a total of approximately million under the stock purchase plan 
income taxes the tax treatment related to the uncertainties associated with the losses incurred by our equity investee smisc  is the principal cause of the increased effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended november  page 
table of contents future trends in operating results our success has been  and is expected to remain  dependent on maintaining good working relationships with the organizations that sanction events at our facilities  particularly with nascar  whose sanctioned events at our wholly owned facilities accounted for approximately percent of our revenues in fiscal in january  nascar announced it would entertain and discuss proposals from track operators regarding potential realignment of nascar nextel cup series dates to more geographically diverse and potentially more desirable markets where there may be greater demand  resulting in an opportunity for increased revenues to the track operators 
nascar approved realignments of certain nascar nextel cup and other events at our facilities for the   and seasons 
we believe that the realignments have provided  and will continue to provide  incremental net positive revenue and earnings as well as further enhance the sport s exposure in highly desirable markets  which we believe benefits the sport s fans  teams  sponsors and television broadcast partners as well as promoters 
nascar has indicated that it is open to discussion regarding additional date realignments 
we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on these future opportunities 
fiscal was our last year under nascar s multi year consolidated television broadcast rights agreements with nbc sports  turner sports  fox and fx 
nascar entered into new combined eight year agreements with fox  abc espn  tnt and speed beginning in for the domestic broadcast and related rights for its nextel cup  busch and craftsman truck series 
the agreements are expected to total approximately billion over the eight year period from through this results in an approximate million gross average annual rights fee for the industry  a more than percent increase over the previous contract average of million annually 
the industry rights fees were approximately million for  and will increase  on average  by approximately three percent per year through the season 
the annual increase is expected to vary between two and four percent per year over the period 
while the industry rights fees were less than the industry rights fees of approximately million  in our opinion this should not overshadow the strategic importance and expected long term benefits of the new contracts 
over the past several years  there has been a shift of major sports programming from network to cable 
the cable broadcasters can support a higher investment through subscriber fees not available to networks  which has resulted in increased rights fees for these sports properties 
cable  however  reaches far fewer households than network broadcasts 
we view nascar s decision to keep approximately two thirds of its nextel cup series event schedule on network television as important to the sport s future growth 
the structure should continue to drive increased fan and media awareness for all three racing series  which will help fuel our long term attendance and corporate related revenues 
we also welcome the chance to re establish the sport s broadcast relationship with espn  which we believe will result in further exposure for nascar racing 
first  we believe the nascar busch series will significantly benefit from the improved continuity of its season long presence on espn 
in addition  we believe the sport as a whole will benefit from the increased ancillary programming and nightly and weekly nascar branded programming and promotions  similar to what espn does with the other major sports 
the most significant benefit of the new contracts is the substantial increase in earnings and cash flow visibility for the entire industry over the contract period 
television broadcast and ancillary rights fees from continuing operations received from nascar for the nascar nextel cup and busch series events and the nascar craftsman truck series events beginning in fiscal  conducted at our wholly owned facilities under these agreements were approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
as media rights revenues fluctuate so do the variable costs tied to the percentage of broadcast rights fees required to be paid to competitors as part of nascar nextel cup  busch and craftsman truck series sanction agreements 
nascar prize and point fund monies  as well as sanction fees nascar direct expenses  are outlined in the sanction agreement for each event and are negotiated in advance of an event 
as previously discussed  included in these nascar direct expenses are percent of the gross domestic page 
table of contents television broadcast rights fees allocated to our nascar nextel cup  busch and craftsman truck series events as part of prize and point fund money 
these annually negotiated contractual amounts paid to nascar contribute to the support and growth of the sport of nascar stock car racing through payments to the teams and sanction fees paid to nascar 
as such  we do not expect these costs to decrease in the future as a percentage of admissions and motorsports related income 
we anticipate any operating margin improvement to come primarily from economies of scale and controlling costs in areas such as motorsports related and general and administrative expenses 
economic conditions may impact our ability to secure revenues from corporate marketing partnerships 
however  we believe that our presence in key markets and impressive portfolio of events are beneficial as we continue to pursue renewal and expansion of existing marketing partnerships and establish new corporate marketing partners 
we believe that revenues from our corporate marketing partnerships will continue to grow over the long term 
an important component of our operating strategy has been our long standing practice of focusing closely on supply and demand regarding additional capacity at our facilities 
we continually evaluate the demand for our most popular racing events in order to add capacity that we believe will provide an acceptable rate of return on invested capital 
through prudent expansion  we attempt to keep demand at a higher level than supply  which stimulates ticket renewals and advance sales 
advance ticket sales result in earlier cash flow and reduce the potential negative impact of actual and forecasted inclement weather on ticket sales 
while we will join with sponsors to offer promotions to generate additional ticket sales  we avoid rewarding last minute ticket buyers by discounting tickets 
we believe it is more important to encourage advance ticket sales and maintain price integrity to achieve long term growth than to capture short term incremental revenue 
in addition to weather  there are a number of factors that impact attendance at our events  including demand in the marketplace and discretionary consumer spending trends affected by employment and other lifestyle and business conditions 
accordingly  we have instituted only modest increases in our weighted average ticket prices for fiscal over the long term  we will continue to optimize capacity  as well as the pricing and packaging of our tickets and other products 
since we compete with newer entertainment venues for patrons and sponsors  we will continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance our facilities  thereby producing additional revenue generating opportunities for us and improving the experience for our guests 
one major example of these efforts is the infield renovation at daytona that was completed for the start of the racing season 
the infield renovation features numerous fan amenities and unique revenue generating opportunities  including garage walk through areas  additional merchandise and concessions vending areas  waterfront luxury recreational vehicle parking areas  a large tunnel to accommodate team haulers and guest recreational vehicles in and out of the infield and other special amenities such as the infield s signature structure  the daytona club 
another example of our efforts to enhance the fan experience includes the fiscal renovation of michigan international speedway s michigan front stretch  including new ticket gates  new vendor and display areas  and several new concession stands  as well as the addition of club seats and luxury suites 
for fiscal  we completed additional renovation projects at california speedway california and talladega superspeedway talladega 
at california  we renovated and expanded the facility s front midway area 
the new plaza features a full service outdoor caf with cuisine by celebrity chef wolfgang puck  in addition to a town center  retail store and concert stage 
other highlights include shade features  modified entry gates  expanded hospitality areas  radio broadcast locations  giant video walls  leisure areas and grass and water accents 
this project was the direct result of fan feedback  and further demonstrates our commitment to providing a premium entertainment environment for our guests 
we also repaved talladega s mile oval in fiscal talladega s racing surface had not been repaved since  and we believe the newly paved racing surface enhanced the thrilling on track competition 
in fiscal  in connection with the construction of the three tiered grandstand at richmond international raceway richmond  we completed a person  members only club for individual fans looking to enjoy a race weekend in style or businesses seeking to entertain clients 
the club also serves as a unique site for special events on non race weekends throughout the year 
for fiscal  we are installing track lighting at chicagoland as well as improving certain electrical infrastructure in certain camping areas 
we are also repaving darlington raceway darlington and constructing a tunnel which page 
table of contents will give improved access to the infield and renovating certain suite facilities 
daytona is completing improvements to its fanzone deck and infield road course 
daytona and michigan are renovating certain grandstands into wider  more comfortable seats 
and  richmond and california are adding escalators to certain grandstands which will improve the fan traffic flow during events 
current litigation from time to time  we are a party to routine litigation incidental to our business 
we do not believe that the resolution of any or all of such litigation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to such routine litigation incident to our business  we are a party to the litigation described below 
in july  kentucky speedway  llc filed a civil action in the eastern district of kentucky against nascar and us which alleged that nascar and isc have acted  and continue to act  individually and in combination and collusion with each other and other companies that control motorsports entertainment facilities hosting nascar nextel cup series  to illegally restrict the award of 
nascar nextel cup series 
races 
the complaint was amended in to seek  in addition to damages  an injunction requiring nascar to develop objective factors for the award of nextel cup races  divestiture of isc and nascar so that the france family and anyone else does not share ownership of both companies or serve as officers or directors of both companies  isc s divestiture of at least of its racetracks that currently operate a nextel cup race and prohibiting further alleged violations of the antitrust laws 
the complaint did not ask the court to cause nascar to award a nextel cup race to the kentucky speedway 
other than some vaguely conclusory allegations  the complaint failed to specify any specific unlawful conduct by us 
pre trial discovery in the case was concluded and based upon all of the factual and expert evidentiary materials adduced we were more firmly convinced than ever that the case was without legal or factual merit 
on january  our position was vindicated when the federal district court judge hearing the case ruled in favor of isc and nascar and entered a judgment which stated it is ordered and adjudged that all claims of the plaintiff  kentucky speedway  llc  be  and they are  hereby dismissed  with prejudice  at the cost of the plaintiff 
the opinion and order of the courted entered on the same day concluded after careful consideration and a thorough review of the record  and granting 
kentucky 
speedway the benefit of the doubt on all reasonable inferences therefrom  the court concludes that 
kentucky 
speedway has failed to make out its case 
subsequently  on january  kentucky speedway  llc filed a notice of appeal to the united states court of appeal for the sixth circuit 
we expect the appellate process to be resolved in our favor in approximately to months 
at this point the likelihood of a materially adverse result appears to be remote  although there is always an element of uncertainty in litigation 
it is premature to attempt to quantify the potential magnitude of such a remote possible adverse decision 
the fees and expenses associated with the defense of this suit have not been covered by insurance and have adversely impacted our financial condition 
since the judgment entered by the court allows us to seek recovery of our costs not including attorney fees from the kentucky speedway  we are preparing materials to submit to the court to have the amount of our allowable costs determined and intend to pursue recovery from the kentucky speedway of the maximum amounts allowed by the court  which should include those costs necessarily incurred in successfully defending the appeal to the sixth circuit

speedway developments in light of nascar s publicly announced position regarding additional potential realignment of the nascar nextel cup series schedule  we also believe there are potential development opportunities in other new  underserved markets across the country 
as such  we have been and are exploring opportunities for public private partnerships targeted to develop one or more motorsports entertainment facilities in new markets  including denver  colorado  the northwest us and the new york metropolitan area 
denver speedway development in february  we announced that we are exploring the possibility of pursuing a public private partnership to develop a national level motorsports entertainment facility in the denver metropolitan region 
through a wholly owned subsidiary  we look forward to working with public entities to explore the feasibility of a jointly funded motorsports entertainment facility that could accommodate approximately  fans and bring considerable economic impact to the area 
the project is in a very early phase and we do not have a pre determined timetable for determining a page 
table of contents specific course of action concerning the pursuit of a public private partnership to fund the project 
northwest us speedway development since  we had been pursuing development of a motorsports entertainment facility in kitsap county  washington  which required state legislation to help finance the project 
in early this legislation was introduced in both the washington state house of representatives and senate 
on april   we announced that despite agreeing to substantial changes to the required legislation it had become apparent that additional modifications would be proposed to the bill 
due to the increased risk that the collective modifications would have a significant negative impact on the project s financial model  we felt it was in our best long term interest to discontinue our efforts at the site 
as a result  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge in fiscal of approximately million  or per diluted share after tax  to reflect the write off of certain capitalized costs including legal  consulting  capitalized interest and other project specific costs 
the charge is included in impairment of long lived assets in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended november  we still believe the pacific northwest represents an attractive long term opportunity  and remain interested in a motorsports entertainment facility development project in the region 
new york metropolitan speedway development during fiscal  we announced our intention to search for a site for a major motorsports entertainment facility in the new york metropolitan area 
our efforts included the evaluation of many different locations 
most recently  we identified a combination of land parcels in the new york city borough of staten island aggregating approximately acres that we targeted for the development of a major motorsports entertainment and retail development project 
our then majority owned subsidiary  development  purchased the total acres for approximately million in early fiscal in december  we announced our decision to discontinue pursuit of a speedway development on staten island 
the decision was driven by a variety of factors  including the inability to secure the critical local political support that is necessary to secure the required land use change approvals for a speedway development  even if we had secured the necessary political support  it became apparent that we would have been faced with unacceptable approval requirements  including operational restrictions that would have made the facility difficult to operate and a significant challenge to market  and the increased risk that these unacceptable approval requirements could result in higher construction spending and annual operating costs  which would have a significant negative impact on the financial model for the speedway development 
the decision to discontinue our speedway development efforts on staten island resulted in a non cash  pre tax charge in our fiscal fourth quarter results of approximately million  or per diluted share after tax 
accounting rules generally accepted in the us require that the property be valued at its then current fair value  which was estimated by an independent appraisal at approximately million 
prior to the write off  we had capitalized spending of approximately million through november   including million for land and related improvements  million for costs related solely to the development of the speedway  and million for capitalized interest and property taxes 
the value of the property is expected to be in excess of million once it is filled and ready for sale 
as previously discussed  we ceased fill operations while we addressed certain issues the dec and dos raised  including the presence of  and potential need to remediate  fill containing constituents above regulatory thresholds 
in may  we entered into a consent order with dec to resolve the issues surrounding these fill operations and the prior placement of fill at the site that contained constituents above regulatory thresholds 
the consent order requires us to remove non compliant fill pursuant to the comprehensive fill removal plan 
we commenced fill removal activities in september  and we expect the fill removal to be complete in the first quarter of fiscal the consent order also required us to pay a penalty to dec page 
table of contents of  half of which was paid in may and the other half of which has been suspended so long as we comply with the terms of the consent order 
the estimated total costs  including the portion of the penalty which has been paid  attributable to the expected fill removal process of approximately million  or per diluted share has been recognized as an impairment of long lived assets in our consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal year ended november  we continue to evaluate the existence of other responsible parties and potential recoveries from such parties  if any 
we expect to resume fill operations within the next several months after complying with the consent order and once other appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained 
the property is currently marketed for sale and we are confident that  on a timely basis  we will agree to terms with a buyer 
although we are disappointed that our speedway development efforts were unsuccessful on staten island  we remain committed to pursuing the development of a motorsports entertainment facility in the region 
due to the considerable interest in and support for nascar racing in the metro new york market  we believe a premier motorsports entertainment facility will have a significant positive impact on the area s economy and prove to be a long term community asset 
daytona live development in may  we announced we had entered into a joint venture the joint venture with the cordish company cordish  one of the largest and most respected developers in the country  to explore a potential mixed use entertainment destination development to be named daytona live  on acres we currently own 
located directly across international speedway boulevard us highway from our daytona motorsports entertainment facility  the acreage currently includes an office building that houses our corporate headquarters and certain offices of nascar 
preliminary conceptual designs call for a  square foot mixed use retail dining entertainment area as well as a  seat movie theater  a residential component and a room hotel 
in addition  the initial development could also include approximately  square feet of office space to house the headquarters of isc  nascar  grand american and their related businesses  and additional space for other tenants 
final design plans for the initial development are expected to be completed by the middle of and will incorporate the results of local market studies and further project analysis 
the joint venture is hopeful to receive all necessary permitting and other approvals for the initial development in the next twelve months 
the current estimated cost for the initial development is approximately million 
both isc and cordish will contribute an equal amount of equity to the joint venture 
we expect our contribution to range between million and million in cash  as well as land currently owned 
the remainder of the project will be primarily privately financed by the joint venture 
however  specific financing considerations for the joint venture are dependent on several factors including lease arrangements and availability of public incentives 
lastly  if the joint venture proceeds with the project  it is expected that our existing office building  which is not fully depreciated  will be razed once the new office building is completed 
we expect to recognize approximately million  or per diluted share  of additional depreciation during fiscal kansas hotel and casino development in april  the kansas state legislature authorized four land based casino licenses  including one for wyandotte county 
the kansas lottery commission will act as the state s casino owner and will recommend one or more managers to the kansas gaming commission which has final approval in selecting the company to manage the one casino permitted under state law for wyandotte county 
in september  our wholly owned subsidiary kansas speedway development corporation ksdc and cordish submitted a joint proposal to the unified government of kansas city and wyandotte county for the development of a casino  hotel and retail and entertainment project in wyandotte county  on property adjacent to kansas speedway 
as of december   the unified government has approved rezoning of acres at kansas speedway to allow development of the page 
table of contents proposed project and endorsed our proposal among others to the kansas lottery for further consideration in compliance with procedures originally established by the kansas lottery 
the lottery commission is presently evaluating proposals for wyandotte county casino projects and will then seek to negotiate management agreements with those managers it intends to recommend to the gaming commission 
by statute  the timeline for this process would take between and days  with an outside completion date of october the initial development is expected to cost in excess of million  and would be financed by the joint venture between ksdc and cordish 
in december  the joint venture negotiated a memorandum of understanding with hard rock hotel holdings to brand the entertainment destination development as a hard rock hotel casino 
internal revenue service examination the service is currently performing a periodic examination of our federal income tax returns for the years ended november  through and has challenged the tax depreciation treatment of a significant portion of our motorsports entertainment facility assets 
through november   we have received reports from the service requesting downward adjustments to our tax depreciation expense for the fiscal years ended november  through  which could potentially result in the reclassification of approximately million of income taxes from deferred to current 
including related interest  the combined after tax cash flow impact of these requested adjustments is approximately million 
in order to prevent incurring additional interest related to fiscal and prior years  we have approximately million on deposit with the service as of november   which is classified as long term assets in our consolidated financial statements 
our deposits are not a payment of tax  and we will receive accrued interest on any of these funds ultimately returned to us 
including related interest  we estimate the combined after tax cash flow impact of future additional federal tax adjustments for fiscal  and related state tax revisions and interest for all periods  to range between million and million at november  in june the service commenced the administrative appeals process which is expected to take up to twelve months to complete 
if our appeal is not resolved satisfactorily  we will evaluate all of our options  including litigation 
we believe that our application of the federal income tax regulations in question  which have been applied consistently since their enactment and have been subjected to previous irs audits  is appropriate  and we intend to vigorously defend the merits of our position 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  we have accrued a deferred tax liability based on the differences between our financial reporting and tax bases of such assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of november  while an adverse resolution of these matters could result in a material negative impact on cash flow  including payment of taxes from amounts currently on deposit with the service  we believe that we have provided adequate reserves related to these matters including interest charges through november  totaling approximately million  and  as a result  do not expect that such an outcome would have a material adverse effect on results of operations 
it is important to note the federal american jobs creation act of legislation  which was effective on october   provides owners of motorsports entertainment facility assets a seven year recovery period for tax depreciation purposes 
the motorsports provision applies prospectively from the date of enactment through january  we and others in the industry are pursuing an extension of this seven year prospective tax depreciation provision 
future cash flows our cash flow from operations consists primarily of ticket  hospitality  merchandise  catering and concession sales and contracted revenues arising from television broadcast rights and marketing partnerships 
we believe that cash flows from operations  along with existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund operations and approved capital projects at existing facilities for the foreseeable future  page 
table of contents payments required in connection with the funding of the unified government s debt service requirements related to the tif bonds  payments related to our existing debt service commitments  payments for share repurchases under our stock purchase plan  any potential payments associated with our keepwell agreements  any equity contributions in connection with the daytona live and kansas hotel and casino developments  any payment of tax that may ultimately occur as a result of the examination by the service  and the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the current legal proceeding discussed in part ii legal proceedings 
we remain interested in pursuing further development and or acquisition opportunities including the possible development of new motorsports entertainment facilities  such as the new york metropolitan area  the northwest us  denver and other areas  the timing  size and success  as well as associated potential capital commitments  of which are unknown at this time 
accordingly  a material acceleration of our growth strategy could require us to obtain additional capital through debt and or equity financings 
although there can be no assurance  we believe that adequate debt and equity financing will be available on satisfactory terms 
while we expect our strong operating cash flow to continue in the future  our financial results depend significantly on a number of factors relating to consumer and corporate spending  including economic conditions affecting marketing dollars available from the motorsports industry s principal sponsors 
consumer and corporate spending could be adversely affected by economic  security and other lifestyle conditions resulting in lower than expected future operating cash flows 
general economic conditions were significantly and negatively impacted by the september  terrorist attacks and the war in iraq and could be similarly affected by any future attacks or fear of such attacks  or by conditions resulting from other acts or prospects of war 
any future attacks or wars or related threats could also increase our expenses related to insurance  security or other related matters 
also  our financial results could be adversely impacted by a widespread outbreak of a severe epidemiological crisis 
the items discussed above could have a singular or compounded material adverse affect on our financial success and future cash flow 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our operating costs and earnings 
recent accounting pronouncements in june the fasb issued interpretation no

the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe the adoption of this interpretation in our first quarter of fiscal will have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates in the normal course of business 
our interest income and expense are most sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates and the libor rate 
in order to manage this exposure  from time to time we use a combination of debt instruments  including the use of derivatives in the form of interest rate swap agreements 
we do not enter into any derivatives for trading purposes 
the objective of our asset management activities is to provide an adequate level of interest income and liquidity to fund operations and capital expansion  while minimizing market risk 
we utilize overnight sweep accounts and short term investments to minimize the interest rate risk 
we do not believe that our interest rate risk related to our cash equivalents and short term investments is material due to the nature of the investments 
our objective in managing our interest rate risk on our debt is to negotiate the most favorable interest rate structures that we can and  as market conditions evolve  adjust our balance of fixed and variable rate debt to optimize our overall borrowing costs within reasonable risk parameters 
interest rate swaps are used from time to time to convert a portion of our debt portfolio from a variable rate to a fixed rate or from a fixed rate to a variable rate 
the following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to interest rate risk 
we utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves 
there are certain page 
table of contents limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented  primarily due to the assumption that interest rates change instantaneously 
in addition  the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have various debt instruments that are issued at fixed rates 
these financial instruments  which have a fixed rate of interest  are exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
the fair values of long term debt are based on quoted market prices at the date of measurement 
our credit facilities approximate fair value as they bear interest rates that approximate market 
at november   we did not have any variable debt outstanding  therefore  a hypothetical increase in interest rates by percent would not result in an increase in our interest expense 
at november   the fair value of our total long term debt as determined by quotes from financial institutions was approximately million 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent shift in interest rates would be approximately million at november  from time to time we utilize derivative investments in the form of interest rate swaps to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing 
the notional amount  interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the debt they are intended to modify 
at november  we did not have any interest rate swap agreements in place 
credit risk arises from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts on a net basis 
however  we minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting counterparties to large banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines 
we do not expect to incur any losses as a result of counterparty default
