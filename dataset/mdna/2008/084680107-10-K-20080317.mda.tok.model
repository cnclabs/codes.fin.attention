item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion is intended to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in this report 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
please see those policies in conjunction with this discussion 
critical accounting policies are those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
management believes that our most critical accounting policies  which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are as follows allowance for loan losses 
arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the allowance for loan losses provides for probable estimable losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information  as well as current economic data  to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
although we believe that we use appropriate available information to establish the allowance for loan losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary if certain future events occur that cause actual results to differ from the assumptions used in making the evaluation 
for example  a downturn in the local economy could cause an increase in non performing loans 
additionally  a decline in real estate values could cause some of our loans to become inadequately collateralized 
in either case  this may require us to increase our provisions for loan losses  which would negatively impact earnings 
the allowance for loan losses discussion in item provides additional information about the allowance 

index income taxes 
management considers accounting for income taxes as a critical accounting policy due to the subjective nature of certain estimates that are involved in the calculation and evaluation of the timing and recognition of resulting tax liabilities and assets 
management uses the asset liability method of accounting for income taxes in which deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
management must assess the realizability of the deferred tax assets  and to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
adjustments to increase or decrease the valuation allowance are generally charged or credited  respectively  to income tax expense 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
in conjunction with the acquisitions of factory point bancorp  inc in and woronoco bancorp in  goodwill was recorded as an intangible asset equal to the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
other intangible assets were recorded for the fair value of core deposits and non compete agreements 
goodwill and intangible assets related to insurance contracts were recorded for the purchase of insurance agencies in the valuation techniques used by management to determine the carrying value of assets acquired in the acquisition and the estimated lives of identifiable intangible assets involve estimates for discount rates  projected future cash flows and time period calculations  all of which are susceptible to change based on changes in economic conditions and other factors 
future events or changes in the estimates which were used to determine the carrying value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets or which otherwise adversely affects their value or estimated lives could have a material adverse impact on future results of operations

offsetting this decrease in nonaccruing commercial business loans was a million increase in nonaccruing commercial mortgages 
the increase in nonaccruing commercial mortgages resulted mainly from the classification of one large commercial mortgage totaling million in the third quarter of and several smaller credits placed on nonaccrual during the year 
in addition to the nonperforming loans discussed above  the company has identified approximately million in potential problem loans at year end as compared to million at year end potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing  but where known information about possible credit problems of the related borrowers causes management to have doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in disclosure of such loans as nonperforming at some time in the future 
potential problem loans are typically loans that are performing but are classified by the company s loan rating system as substandard 
at december  and  potential problem loans primarily consisted of commercial business loans and commercial mortgages 
at year end  there were six potential problem loans that exceeded million  totaling million in aggregate compared to six potential problem loans exceeding million  totaling million at year end management cannot predict the extent to which economic conditions may worsen or other factors which may impact borrowers and the potential problem loans

index loan loss allowance 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate

the various factors used in the methodologies are reviewed on a periodic basis 
the company considers the allowance for loan losses of million appropriate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of december  however  no assurance can be given that the company will not  in any particular period  sustain loan losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved  or that subsequent evaluations of the loan portfolio  in light of factors then prevailing  including economic conditions  the company s ongoing credit review process or regulatory requirements  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan losses 
among other factors  a protracted economic slowdown and or a decline in commercial or residential real estate values in the company s markets may have an adverse impact on the current adequacy of the allowance for loan losses by increasing credit risk and the risk of potential loss 
the ratio of the loan loss allowance to total loans was at year end and year end the total allowance for loan losses is generally available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
the allocation of the company s allowance for loan losses disclosed in a table on page of this document is subject to change based on the changes in criteria used to evaluate the allowance and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future losses in any particular portfolio 
in  the company refined its allowance for loan losses allocation methodology 
in addition  management determined in the third quarter of  loan losses would increase above negligible levels of recent years due to signs of an economic slowdown and increasing risk factors in the commercial and real estate loan portfolios 
these changes resulted in a third quarter provision for loan losses of million to increase general pool reserve levels due to a higher percentage of inherent losses in the loan portfolio

off balance sheet arrangements 
in the normal course of operations  the company engages in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles are not recorded in the company s financial instruments 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used primarily to manage customers requests for funding and take the form of loan commitments and lines of credit 
in january  the company entered into interest rate swaps related to million of fhlbb borrowings 
the interest rate swaps are for terms up to years and require the company to receive a floating rate of interest tied to month libor and pay a fixed rate at based on the million notional amount 
a further presentation of the company s off balance sheet arrangements presented is in note  commitments  contingencies  and off balance sheet activities in the notes to the financial statements 
for  the company did not engage in any off balance sheet transactions reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented in this form k have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of berkshire bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on berkshire bank s performance than the general level of inflation 
interest rates may be affected by inflation  but the direction and magnitude of the impact may vary 
a sudden change in inflation or expectations about inflation  with a related change in interest rates  would have a significant impact on our operations 
impact of new accounting pronouncements please refer to the note on recent accounting pronouncements in note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of new accounting pronouncements 

index item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk and market risk analysis qualitative aspects of market risk 
the bank s most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
the bank seeks to avoid fluctuations in its net interest income and to maximize net interest income within acceptable levels of risk through periods of changing interest rates 
berkshire bank maintains an asset liability committee that is responsible for reviewing its asset liability policies and interest rate risk position 
this committee meets at least quarterly and reports trends and interest rate risk position to the risk management committee and board of directors on a quarterly basis 
the extent of the movement of interest rates is an uncertainty that could have a negative impact on the company s earnings 
the bank has managed interest rate risk by emphasizing assets with shorter term repricing durations  periodically selling long term fixed rate assets  promoting low cost core deposits  and using fhlbb advances to structure its liability repricing durations 
berkshire bank also has used off balance sheet derivative instruments in the past and may do so in the future in order to enhance its interest rate risk position and manage its balance sheet 
quantitative aspects of market risk 
berkshire hills uses a simulation model to measure the potential change in net interest income that would result from both an instantaneous or ramped increase or decrease of market interest rates assuming a parallel shift along the entire yield curve 
while emphasis has previously been placed on the shocked model  in recent years  the company has come to stress the importance of the ramped interest rate scenario as management believes this more accurately reflects actions that will be taken by the federal reserve bank and the path of interest rates 
loans  deposits and borrowings were expected to reprice at the repricing or maturity date 
the company uses prepayment guidelines set forth by market sources as well as company generated data where applicable 
cash flows from loans and securities are assumed to be reinvested based on current operating conditions and strategies 
other assumptions about balance sheet mix are generally held constant 
no material changes have been made to the methodologies used in the model 
change in interest rates basis net interest months months points rate ramp amount change change change change dollars in thousands at december  at december  at year end  the company displayed an improved  but still modestly negative income sensitivity to higher interest rates liability sensitivity than it did at the end of the primary factors for the decrease in liability sensitivity has to do with the mortgage and securities deleverage that took place at the end of the third quarter and the execution of million pay fixed receive floating swaps that the bank committed to on the last day of these transactions were able to offset items such as the acquisition of factory point national bank and the emphasis on growing money market type core accounts that would have increased the bank s liability sensitive position 
berkshire believes that growing money market deposit accounts is an effective strategy to grow customer relationships and increase fee revenue and as such has reduced the emphasis on short term high rate certificates of deposit 
berkshire bank also realizes that these money market accounts could potentially be even more rate sensitive than the certificates and management will closely monitor this potential impact to the bank s interest rate risk position and may use longer term fhlbb advances and interest rate swaps to hedge this risk 

index due to the limitations and uncertainties relating to model assumptions  these computations should not be relied on as projections of income 
further  the computations do not reflect any actions that management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the most significant assumption relates to expectations for the interest sensitivity of non maturity deposit accounts in a rising rate environment 
the model assumes that deposit rate sensitivity will be a percentage of the market interest rate change as follows now accounts ranging between and depending on product type  money market accounts ranging between and depending on the balance and product type  and savings accounts 
one of the significant limitations of the simulation is that it assumes parallel shifts in the yield curve 
actual interest rate risks are often more complex than this scenario 
a key interest rate change in was the steepening of the yield curve in the second half of the year 
assumption changes in were based on a review of past performance and future expectations and were not viewed as material
