table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview incorporated in march  we are a provider of content management software solutions 
our software and services enable organizations to leverage content to drive business growth by improving online business performance  increasing collaboration and streamlining business processes both internally and externally 
since our inception  over  enterprise and professional services organizations in countries worldwide have chosen our solutions 
we operate in a single segment  which is the design  development and marketing of content management software solutions 
our goal is to be the leading provider of content management software solutions 
we are focused on generating profitable and sustainable growth through internal research and development  licensing from third parties and acquisitions of businesses with complementary products and technologies 
total revenues for were million up from we experienced increases in over in each revenue category license  support  consulting and training 
these results reflected increased information technology spending  particularly spending on content management initiatives  in both domestic and international markets and the success of our strategic relationships 
our revenues may have also benefited from consolidation within the content management market  which we believe created uncertainty regarding some of our competitors and their products 
the unfavorable economic and market conditions that are currently affecting the united states could reduce levels of information technology spending from those that we witnessed in  which in turn  could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
if such a reduced spending environment develops  we believe the strategies we are implementing may mitigate some of its effects  and will provide long term growth opportunities 
we license our software to businesses  professional services organizations  capital markets companies and government agencies generally on a non exclusive and perpetual basis 
the growth in our software license revenues is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions  customer budgetary constraints and the competitive position of our software solutions 
software licenses revenues are also affected by long  unpredictable sales cycles  so they are difficult to forecast from period to period 
although our consolidated results of operations have improved in recent periods  our results were impacted in these periods by long product evaluation periods  protracted contract negotiations and multiple authorization requirements of our customers  all of which we believe are characteristic of the market for content management products and services 
during the latter half of the fourth quarter of  we observed some of our customers  specifically those in the global capital markets industry  engaging in unusually careful budgeting processes for their information technology spending in in the past  under similar circumstances  we experienced a relative lengthening of the sales cycle with respect to customers that demonstrated this kind of behavior 
to the extent other customers in other industries exhibit this same behavior in response to the unfavorable economic and market conditions that are currently affecting the united states  our sales cycle could lengthen  which in turn  could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
customer support revenues are primarily influenced by the number and size of new support contracts sold in connection with software licenses and the renewal rate of existing support contracts 
customers that purchase software licenses usually purchase support contracts and renew their support contracts annually 
our support contracts entitle our customers to unspecified product upgrades and technical support during the support period  which is typically one year 
services revenues consist of software installation and integration  training and business process consulting  as well as revenue from software products we sell on a subscription basis 
other than our sales of software on a subscription basis  services revenues tend to lag software license revenues since consulting services  if purchased  are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses or in connection with software upgrades 
professional services are predominately billed on a time and materials basis and we recognize revenues when the services are performed 
professional services revenues also include subscription revenues relating to our multivariable testing and website optimization services 
professional services revenues are influenced primarily by the 
table of contents number of professional services engagements sold in connection with software license sales and the customers use of third party services providers 
because our products are complex and involve a consultative sales model  our strategy is to market and sell our products and services primarily through a direct sales force 
we look to augment those efforts through relationships with technology vendors  professional services firms  systems integrators and other strategic partners  which assist our direct sales force in obtaining customer leads and referrals 
approximately of our new customer license orders for the year ended december  were influenced by or co sold with our strategic partners and resellers 
in general  these partners and resellers perform the installation and integration  consulting and other services for the enterprises to which they resell our products  and we are not engaged by their customers for these services 
our sales efforts are targeted to senior executives and personnel who are responsible for managing an enterprise s information technology initiatives 
we generate demand for our products and services primarily through our direct sales force and strategic relationships 
our direct sales force is responsible for managing customer relationships and opportunities and is supported by product  marketing and service specialists 
in the rapidly changing and increasingly complex and competitive information technology environment  we believe product differentiation will be a key to market leadership 
thus  our strategy is to continually work to enhance and extend the features and functionality of our existing products and develop new and innovative solutions for our customers 
we have in the past and expect to continue to devote substantial resources to our research and development activities 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
we recorded income from operations in of million  as compared million in and a loss of million in we are focused on improving our operating margins by increasing our revenues and carefully managing our expenses through improved productivity and utilization of economies of scale 
as a significant portion of our expenses are employee related  we manage our headcount from period to period 
we had employees worldwide at december  versus employees at december  and at december  the increase in headcount from to was due in part to the employees we hired as part of the acquisition of optimost and  to a lesser extent  to our efforts to rationalize the degree to which we incur subcontractor expenses 
we also look to improve our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise is available at lower costs 
additionally  we pay close attention to other costs  including facilities and related expense  professional fees and promotional expenses  which are each significant components of our expense structure 
while we have been carefully managing our costs and expenses relating to the operation of our business  our general and administrative expenses have increased significantly during as compared to as we have incurred significant accounting  legal and other expenses relating to the audit committee s review of our historical stock option grant procedures and related accounting throughout our acquisition strategy is an important element of our overall business strategy 
we seek to identify acquisition opportunities that will enhance the features and functionality of our existing products  provide new products and technologies to sell to our installed base of customers  acquire additional customers that we can sell our existing products  or which facilitate entry into adjacent markets 
in evaluating these opportunities  we consider  among other items  both time to market of the technologies or products to be acquired and potential market share gains 
we have completed a number of acquisitions in the past  and we may acquire other technologies  products and companies in the future 
in recent years  we have added through acquisition products and solutions with digital asset management  collaborative document management  records management  content publishing  website optimization and capital markets vertical market capabilities 
the results of operations of these business combinations have been included prospectively from the closing dates of these transactions 
accordingly  our financial results may not be directly comparable to those of the previous periods 

table of contents results of operations revenues years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages license percentage of total revenues support and service percentage of total revenues total revenues increased from million in to million in we believe that the increase in total revenues was attributable to higher customer spending on content management initiatives in all our geographic regions

our future license revenues may be affected by adverse changes in general economic or political conditions  and the challenges that are currently affecting economic conditions in the united states 
for additional factors that may impact our revenues  see part i  item a 
risk factors 
support and service 
support and service revenues increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to higher support revenue from our larger installed base of new customers and existing customers purchasing support contracts and higher consulting revenues primarily related to increased sales of software licenses 
support and service revenues in also included million in subscription revenue from optimost  which was acquired in november support and service revenues increased from million in to million in this increase was primarily due to higher support revenue from our larger installed base of new customers and existing customers purchasing support contracts and higher consulting revenues primarily related to increased sales of software licenses 
we believe that our support renewal rates have not fluctuated significantly during these periods 
to the extent that our license revenues decline in the future  our support and service revenues may also decline 
specifically  a decline in license revenues may result in fewer consulting engagements 
additionally  since customer support contracts are generally sold with each license transaction  a decline in license revenues may also result in a slowing of growth in customer support revenue 
however  since customer support revenues are recognized over the duration of the support contract  the impact will not be experienced for up to several months after a decline in license revenues 
in the future  customer support revenues may also be adversely impacted if customers fail to renew their support agreements or reduce the license software quantity under their support agreements 
our ability to increase subscription revenues from our website optimization products depend on our success in attracting new customers  retaining our existing customers and cross selling these products to customers that have purchased our other products

cost of license revenues includes expenses incurred to manufacture  package and distribute our software products and documentation  as well as costs of licensing third party software embedded in or sold with our software products and amortization of purchased technology associated with business combinations 
cost of license revenues represented  and of total license revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of license revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues from to was primarily due to an million decrease in amortization of certain purchased technology which has become fully amortized in november  offset by a  increase in costs of licensing third party software and a  increase in packaging expense 
the increase in cost of license revenues in absolute dollars from to was primarily due to a million increase in amortization of purchased technology associated with acquisitions 
based solely on acquisitions completed through december  and assuming no impairments  we expect the amortization of purchased technology classified as a cost of license revenues to be million in  million in  million in  million in  million in and  in we expect cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues to vary from period to period depending on the mix of software products sold  the extent to which third party software products are bundled with our products and the amount of overall license revenues  as many of the third party software products embedded with our software are under fixed fee arrangements

cost of support and service revenues represented  and of support and service revenues in  and  respectively 
support and service headcount was  and at december   and  respectively 
the headcount increase from to was due in part to employees hired from optimost 
the increase in headcount also is the result of hiring to support our revenue growth and reduce our dependency on contract labor 
we realize lower gross profits on support and service revenues than on license revenues 
in addition  we may contract with outside consultants and system integrators to supplement the services we provide to customers  which increases our costs and further reduces gross profits 
as a result  if support and service revenues increase as a percentage of total revenues or if we increase our use of third parties to provide such services  our gross profits will be lower and our operating results may be adversely affected

sales and marketing headcount was  and at december   and  respectively 
the headcount increase from to was primarily due to employees hired from optimost 
we expect that the percentage of total revenues represented by sales and marketing expenses will fluctuate from period to period due to the timing of hiring of new sales and marketing personnel  our spending on marketing programs and the level of revenues  in particular license revenues  in each period

as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expense was in and in and general and administrative headcount was  and at december   and  respectively

the decreases in amortization of intangible assets from to and to were primarily due to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized 
based on business combinations completed through december   we expect amortization of intangible assets to be million in  million in  million in and million in we may incur additional amortization expense exceeding these expected future levels to the extent we make any future acquisitions 
restructuring and excess facilities charges recoveries years ended december  percentage change to to in thousands  except percentages restructuring and excess facilities charges recoveries percentage of total revenues percentage is not meaningful in  we incurred additional excess facilities costs of  related to the acquisition of optimost in november as we relocated employees from one of our existing facilities to the optimost facility 
in addition  we also recorded  to increase the anticipated operating expenses for certain of our previously abandoned 
table of contents facilities 
we also recorded  of additional restructuring expense to accrete the remaining excess facilities obligations to present value 
in  we reversed  of the previously recorded restructuring accrual as a result of a change in the estimate of expected sublease income for one of our excess facilities located in the san francisco bay area due to an extension to a sublease agreement for that facility 
we also reversed  of the previously recorded restructuring accrual as a result of revisions to estimated operating expenses for certain of our previously abandoned facilities 
we also reversed  of the previously recorded restructuring accrual related to litigation exposure and expected legal costs since certain outstanding matters associated with an employee termination were resolved 
in  we recorded  of additional restructuring expense to accrete the remaining excess facilities obligations to present value 
in  we reversed  of the previously recorded restructuring accrual as a result of subleasing an excess facility in mountain view  california  which sublease was not previously anticipated or considered probable 
we also resolved several outstanding matters associated with the termination of certain european employees in and  as a result  we reversed  of the previously recorded restructuring accrual related to expected settlement costs 
further  we revised our estimates of certain sublease assumptions and lease exit costs and reversed  of previously recorded excess facilities accrual 
in  we recorded  of additional restructuring expense to accrete the remaining excess facilities obligations to present value 
the expenses recorded for excess facilities were based on payments due over the remainder of the lease term and estimated operating costs offset by our estimate of future sublease income

the effective tax rate for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
this change in the effective rate was primarily due to the effect of income taxes and foreign withholding taxes with significantly increased pre tax income 
during the year ended december   we reduced our valuation allowance recorded in prior years for deferred tax assets by million based on our assessment that it is more likely than not that we will recognize these deferred tax assets 
our conclusion was reached after an assessment of all the relevant factors  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  impacting our ability to realize the benefit associated with our deferred tax assets 
factors or evidence we considered included the impacts of the limitations imposed by sections and of the internal revenue code relating to cumulative ownership changes on the use of net operating loss and credit carryforwards 
as a result of the valuation allowance release  we recorded a united states deferred tax benefit of million and a million reduction in the goodwill originally recorded in connection with the acquisitions of imanage  inc imanage and scrittura acquisitions 
the reduction in goodwill was required in accordance with sfas no 
as a result of the reversal of valuation allowance that had been previously recorded against deferred tax assets acquired as in connection with the acquisitions of imanage and scrittura  respectively 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  we elected to use the short form method to calculate the tax effects of stock based compensation

in connection with the adoption of sfas no

our uses of cash include payroll and payroll related expenses and operating expenses such as marketing programs  travel  professional fees and facilities and related costs 
we also use cash to purchase property and equipment  pay liabilities for excess facilities and to acquire businesses and technologies to expand our product offerings and increase our market share 
a number of non cash items were charged to expense in  and these items include depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  intangible assets and stock based compensation

at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments 
these amounts have been invested in highly liquid united states government agency securities  corporate obligations  securities issued by government sponsored enterprises  commercial paper  certificates of deposit and money market funds according to our investment policies 
at december   our investments in mortgaged backed securities totaled million  all of which were issued by government sponsored enterprises  including fannie mae  freddie mac and the federal home loan bank 
we have classified our investment portfolio as available for sale  and our investment objectives are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly risking principal 
we may sell an investment at any time if the quality rating of the investment declines  the yield on the investment is no longer attractive or if a requirement for cash arises 
because we invest only in investment securities that are highly liquid with a ready market  we believe that the purchase  maturity or sale of our investments has no material impact on our overall liquidity 
we anticipate that we will continue to purchase property and equipment as necessary in the normal course of our business 
the amount and timing of these purchases and the related cash outflows in future periods is difficult to predict and is dependent on a number of factors including the hiring of employees  the rate of change of computer hardware and software used in our business and our business outlook 

table of contents we have used cash to acquire businesses and technologies that enhance and expand our product offerings and increase our market share  and we anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future 
the nature of these transactions makes it difficult to predict the amount and timing of such cash requirements 
we may also be required to raise additional debt or equity financing to complete future acquisitions 
we receive cash from the exercise of common stock options and the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
while we expect to continue to receive these proceeds in future periods  the timing and amount of such proceeds are difficult to predict and are contingent on a number of factors including the price of our common stock  the number of employees participating in our stock option plans and our employee stock purchase plan and general market conditions

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we estimated sublease income and the related timing thereof based on existing sublease agreements or with the input of third party real estate consultants and current market conditions  among other factors 
our estimates of sublease income may vary significantly from actual amounts realized depending  in part  on factors that may be beyond our control  such as the time periods required to locate and contract suitable subleases and the market rates at the time of such subleases 

table of contents we had a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of related interest totaling approximately million as of december  due to the uncertainties to the tax matters  we are unable to reasonably estimate when the cash settlement with a taxing authority will occur 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have entered into standby letters of credit agreements associated with our facilities leases  which serve as required security deposits for such facilities

we cannot assure you that additional equity or debt financing  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
financial risk management as we operate in a number of countries around the world  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and may have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial results 
our primary exposures relate to non united states dollar denominated revenues and operating expenses in europe  asia pacific and canada 
we use foreign currency forward contracts as risk management tools and not for speculative or trading purposes 
although these contracts are or can be effective as hedges from an economic perspective  they do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
gains and losses on the changes in the fair values of the forward contracts are included in interest income and other  net in our consolidated statements of income 
we do not anticipate significant currency gains or losses in the near term 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss on our consolidated balance sheets 
these securities are not leveraged and are held for purposes other than trading 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not use off balance sheet arrangements with unconsolidated entities or related parties  nor do we use other forms of off balance sheet arrangements such as research and development arrangements 
accordingly  our liquidity and capital resources are not subject to off balance sheet risks from unconsolidated entities 
as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of securities and exchange commission regulation s k 
we have entered into operating leases for our office facilities in the normal course of business 
these arrangements may be deemed to be a form of off balance sheet financing

future minimum lease payments under our operating leases as of december  are detailed previously in liquidity and capital resources 
in the normal course of business  we provide indemnifications of varying scope to customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
historically  costs related to these indemnification provisions have not been significant and we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these indemnification provisions on our future consolidated results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on our revenues  income from operations and net income  as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
we base our estimates  assumptions and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments and make changes as deemed appropriate under the circumstances 
we also discuss and review the suitability of these critical accounting policies and our critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and our independent registered public accountants 
we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to an understanding of our historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses and significant estimates and judgments applied by management in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements  areas that are of particular significance include revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  estimating the accrual for restructuring and excess facilities costs  accounting for stock based compensation  accounting for income taxes  and valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from the license of our software products and from support  consulting and training services 
we recognize revenue using the residual method in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  for agreements that have multiple deliverables or multiple element arrangements eg  software products  services  support  etc  revenue is recognized for delivered elements only where vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements 
our specific objective evidence of fair value for support is based on the renewal rate as stated in the agreement  so long as the rate is substantive 
our specific objective evidence of fair value for our other undelivered elements is based on the price of the element when sold separately 
as of december   we had not yet established specific objective evidence of fair value for our multivariable optimization service 
once we have established the fair value of each of the undelivered elements  the dollar value of the arrangement is allocated to the undelivered elements first and the residual of the dollar value of the arrangement is then allocated to the delivered elements 
at the outset of the arrangement with the customer  we defer revenue for the fair value of undelivered elements eg  support  consulting and training and recognize revenue for the remainder of the arrangement fee attributable to the elements initially delivered in the arrangement ie  software product when the basic criteria in sop no 
have been met 
for arrangements that include a support renewal rate that we determine is not substantive  all revenue for such arrangement is recognized ratably over the applicable support period 
for arrangements that include our multivariable optimization service  we recognize all revenue for such 
table of contents arrangements ratably over the longest service period in the arrangement until the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is established  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
under sop no 
 revenue attributable to an element in a customer arrangement is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable and the arrangement does not require additional services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
at the outset of our customer arrangements  if we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue when the arrangement fee becomes due and payable 
we use judgment to assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with each transaction 
if a portion of the license fee is due beyond our normal payments terms  which generally does not exceed days from the invoice date  we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we use judgment to determine collectibility on a case by case basis  following analysis of the general payment history within the geographic sales region and a customer s years of operation  payment history and credit profile 
if we determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is not probable based upon our review process  we recognize revenue as payments are received 
we periodically review collection patterns from our geographic locations to ensure historical collection results provide a reasonable basis for revenue recognition upon signing of an arrangement 
support and service revenues consist of professional services and support fees 
professional services consist of software installation and integration  training and business process consulting 
professional services are predominantly billed on a time and materials basis and we recognize revenues as the services are performed 
if uncertainty exists about our ability to complete the project  our ability to collect the amounts due  or in the case of fixed fee consulting arrangements  our ability to estimate the remaining costs to be incurred to complete the project  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is resolved 
our multivariable testing and website optimization applications acquired in our november acquisition of optimost are provided as a service 
we offer such service on a subscription basis and we recognize subscription revenues ratably over the contract term  beginning on the effective date of the contract 
the subscription service contracts include professional services 
we recognize professional services provided for in subscription service contracts as subscription revenues because these services are considered to be inseparable from the subscription service  and we have not yet established objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered element 
all elements of these subscription services are recognized as subscription revenue over the contract term 
we recognize revenues resulting from professional services sold separately from the subscription service contracts as these services are performed 
support contracts are typically priced as a percentage of the product license fee and generally have a one year term 
services provided to customers under support contracts include technical product support and unspecified product upgrades when and if available 
revenues from advanced payments for support contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates as to the overall collectibility of accounts receivable and provide an allowance for accounts receivable considered uncollectible 
in estimating this allowance  our management specifically analyzes our accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
actual customer collections could differ from our estimates 
in general  our allowance for doubtful accounts consists of specific accounts where we believe collection is not probable and an estimate  based on historical write offs  of the potential write offs for receivables not specifically reserved 
allowance for sales returns 
from time to time  a customer may return to us some or all of the software purchased 
while our software and reseller agreements generally do not provide for a specific right of return  we may accept product returns in certain circumstances 
to date  sales returns have been infrequent and not significant in relation to our total revenues 
we make an estimate of our expected returns and provide an allowance for sales returns in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
management 
table of contents specifically analyzes our revenue transactions  customer software installation patterns  historical return patterns  current economic trends and customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns 
restructuring and excess facilities accrual 
in connection with our restructuring and facility consolidation plans  we perform evaluations of our then current facilities requirements and identify facilities that are in excess of our current and estimated future needs 
when a facility is identified as excess and we have ceased use of the facility  we accrue the fair value of the remaining lease obligation 
in determining fair value of expected sublease income over the remainder of the lease term and of related exit costs  if any  we receive appraisals from real estate brokers to aid in our estimate 
in addition  during the evaluation of our facilities requirements  we also identify operating equipment and leasehold improvements that may be impaired 
our estimate of sublease income from vacant excess facilities could differ from actual results and such differences could require additional charges or credits that could materially affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
we reassess our excess facilities liability each period based on current real estate market conditions to determine if our estimates of the amount and timing of future sublease income are reasonable 
accounting for stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method  in which compensation expense is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for all stock options granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r that remain unvested on the effective date 
since we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  the consolidated results of operations have not been restated for prior periods 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of years 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards requires judgment  including estimating expected life  stock price volatility and forfeiture rates 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions are shown in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the expected life of options granted based on the history of grants  exercises and cancellations in our option database 
we also estimate the volatility based upon the historical volatility experienced in our stock price over the expected term of the option 
to the extent volatility of our stock price changes in the future  our estimates of the fair value of options granted in the future would change  thereby increasing or decreasing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
the risk free interest rates are based on the united states treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the options 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we used an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate when amortizing our expense 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate was based primarily upon historical experience of employee turnover 
to the extent we revise our estimates in the future  our stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
in the future  as empirical evidence regarding these input estimates is able to provide more directionally predictive results  we may change or refine our approach of deriving these input estimates 
these changes could impact our fair value of options granted in the future 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized  based on the weight of available evidence at the time of the assessment 
we also review our net operating loss and credit carryforwards to assess the impact of statutory limitations 
we establish a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets if we determine that it is more likely than not that some or all of the 
table of contents deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we exercise significant judgment in determining our provisions for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future tax benefit from our deferred tax assets 
during  we assessed the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets and based on the weight of available evidence  including earnings history and projected future taxable income in based on this assessment  which is based on one year of projected taxable income  we determined that it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of million of our deferred tax assets that had previously been assessed to not meet the more likely than not standard  and released valuation allowance accordingly 
on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements and provides guidance on de recognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition issues 
fin no 
prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as this requires us to determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation is based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues under audit  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision in the period 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when those returns are filed and the impacts of the adjustments are known 
as a matter of course we may be audited by various taxing authorities and those audits may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution results in us owing additional taxes 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law  we believe certain positions are likely to be challenged by tax authorities and we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit 
we evaluate these reserves each quarter and adjust the reserves and the related interest in light of changing facts and circumstances that affect the probability of realizing tax benefits  such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately provided for any known tax contingencies  however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the periods that assessments are resolved or when the statutes of limitations expire 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets 
we account for goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 we are required to perform an impairment review of goodwill on at least an annual basis 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step we compare the fair value of our single reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the reporting unit s carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we move on to step if the unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step we perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to its identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this allocation derives an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess 
we have determined that we have one reporting unit 
we performed and completed the required annual impairment testing in the third quarter of upon completing our review  we determined that the carrying value 
table of contents of the recorded goodwill had not been impaired and no impairment charge was recorded 
assumptions and estimates about future values and remaining useful lives are complex and often subjective 
although we determined in that the recorded goodwill had not been impaired  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance may result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
accordingly  future changes in market capitalization could result in significantly different fair values of the reporting unit  which may impair goodwill 
we are also required to assess goodwill for impairment on an interim basis when indicators exist that goodwill may be impaired based on the factors mentioned above 
for example  if our market capitalization declines below our net book value or we suffer a sustained decline in our stock price  we will assess whether the goodwill has been impaired 
a significant impairment could result in additional charges and have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition and operating results 
we account for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets utilizing sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization  be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the recoverability of an asset is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we do not believe there were any circumstances which indicated that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
intangible assets  other than goodwill  are amortized over estimated useful lives of between and months 
the amortization expense related to the intangible assets may be accelerated in the future if we reduce the estimated useful life of the intangible assets or determine that an impairment has occurred

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for non trading purposes 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
interest rate risk the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal and provide liquidity while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly risking principal 
to achieve these objectives  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate obligations  certificates of deposit and money market funds 
we invest in high quality credit issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
we seek to preserve our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only high quality credit securities that we believe to have low credit risk and by positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the short term interest bearing portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents 
investments with maturities greater than three months are available for sale and are considered to be short term investments

further  we hold commercial paper and debt securities in government agencies  government sponsored enterprises and corporate obligations of million at december  and the market value of these investments may decline if interest rates rise 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of december   the fair market value of our portfolio of debt securities would decrease by approximately  if the market value of these debt securities decline  we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell the securities 
however  we reduce our interest rate risk by investing in instruments with remaining time to maturity of less than two years 
at december  and  we had no outstanding borrowings 
foreign currency risk we develop our software products in the united states and india for sale in the americas  europe and asia pacific 
our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets
