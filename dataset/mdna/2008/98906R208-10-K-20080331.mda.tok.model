item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below and elsewhere in this report on form k and in our other public filings 
the occurrence of one or more of these risks could also materially and adversely affect the price of our common stock 
financing if we require additional financing to sustain our operations  and we are unable to obtain it on favorable terms  we may need to significantly curtail operations 
during the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million and had cash used in operations of  as of december   we had an excess of current liabilities compared to current assets of million 
on december  the company entered into a loan and security agreement with lasalle bank national association which was amended on may   november  and at the time of the sale of pdi on march  as amended  the loan and security agreement provides for a million loan facility 

table of contents at march   the outstanding loan balance was  with available borrowings of  the loan has an expiration date of december  in february we entered into a line of credit agreement with bruno guazzoni  the uncle of our chief executive officer and the owner of approximately of our outstanding common stock  in the amount of  this line of credit is available for working capital requirements and is unrestricted 
the line has a maturity date of march  as of december  the loan balance was  with available borrowings of  on february   zcs entered into a new  unsecured promissory note in an aggregate principal amount of  with bruno guazzoni 
this note has a maturity date of march  and requires quarterly payments of interest beginning march   at the rate of eleven percent per annum 
principal is repayable at maturity 
the note may be pre paid without penalty 
the proceeds of this note were used fund the cash portion of the merger consideration paid at closing for the acquisition of the dba group  discussed above 
in addition to this line of credit and the february promissory note  the company as of march  has outstanding promissory notes with mr 
guazzoni in an aggregate principal amount of  on march   the maturity of these notes was extended to march  notwithstanding these potential and existing financing sources  such additional financing may not be available  or if available  may not be obtainable on terms satisfactory to us 
if we cannot raise additional funds  we may be required to significantly curtail our operations  which would have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flow 
our future capital uses and requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the extent to which our solutions and services gain market acceptance  the level of revenues from present and future solutions and services  the expansion of operations  the costs and timing of product and service developments and sales and marketing activities  costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses  and competitive developments 
in addition  in order to continue to increase sales and marketing efforts  to expand and enhance the solutions and services we are able to offer to current and future customers and to fund potential acquisitions  we will require additional capital that may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
as a consequence  we will be required to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative relationships  bank facilities or other arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
in addition  if unforeseen difficulties arise in the course of these or other aspects of our business  we may be required to spend funds in an amount greater than anticipated 
such additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
our inability to obtain sufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our expansion programs or to limit the marketing of our services 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business 
any additional equity financing is expected to be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants and increased interest costs 
we have financed our operations to date primarily through private sales of equity securities  and loans from related parties and business associates 
the company has not achieved profitability in each reporting period and may incur net losses in future quarters 
the company has a history of operating losses  including a loss from continuing operations of approximately million for the year ended december  and a loss from continuing operations of approximately million for the year ended december  we may incur additional operating losses in the future 
operating expenses may increase as we seek to grow our business through acquisition and as our existing business expands 
even if we achieve consistent profitability  we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or be able to raise capital in sufficient amounts to enable us to continue to 
table of contents expand our business 
an inability to sustain profitability may also result in an impairment loss in the value of our long lived assets  principally goodwill  property and equipment  and other tangible and intangible assets 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations or raise capital in sufficient amounts  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
termination of a contract by a significant customer and or cancellation with short notice  or failure by us to attract new customers and replace customers not renewing their contracts  could reduce our revenue and profitability and adversely affect our financial condition 
for the year ended december   our largest customer accounted for approximately of revenues 
non renewal or termination of contracts with a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our business 
a large portion of our revenues were derived from professional services that are generally non recurring in nature 
there can be no assurance that we will obtain additional contracts for projects similar in scope to those previously obtained from our principal customers or any other customer  that we will be able to retain existing customers or attract new customers or that we will not remain largely dependent on a limited customer base  which may continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues 
in addition  we may be subject to delays in customer funding  non renewal  delay  termination  reduction or modification of contracts in the event of changes in customer policies or as a result of budgetary constraints  and increased or unexpected costs resulting in losses under fixed fee contracts 
our success in meeting growth targets is dependent on our ability to maintain existing clients and to continually attract and retain new customers to replace customers who have not renewed their contracts 
achieving significant market acceptance requires substantial effort and expenditures on our part to create awareness of our services 
an unexpected shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses  or significant bad debt experience  could materially and adversely affect our business 
revenues are difficult to forecast 
we may increase our corporate overhead expenses as the number of acquisitions we complete increases and will increase overhead to comply with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act 
meanwhile  our business units may increase their operating expenses for sales  marketing and technical personnel to sell  provide and support their products and services 
additionally  at any given point in time we may have significant accounts receivable balances with customers that expose us to credit risks 
if we have an unexpected shortfall in revenues in relation to our expenses  or significant bad debt experience  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
it services are subject to uncertain demand due to emerging and evolving markets and technology 
the markets for some of our services are changing rapidly and evolving and  therefore  the ultimate level of demand for our services is subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
any significant decline in demand for programming and applications development and it consulting services could materially adversely affect our business and prospects 
significant technological changes could render our existing products and services obsolete 
to be successful  we must adapt to this rapidly changing market by continually improving the responsiveness  functionality and features of our products and services to meet customers needs 
if we are unable to respond to technological advances and conform to emerging industry standards in a cost effective and timely manner  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
the it services industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
competition for our it solutions is significant  and we expect that competition will continue to intensify due to the low barriers to entry 
we may not have the financial resources  technical expertise  sales and marketing or support capabilities to successfully meet this competition 
if we are unable to compete successfully against our competitors  our business will be adversely affected 
we compete against numerous large companies that have substantially greater market presence  longer operating histories  more significant customer bases  and financial  technical  facilities  marketing  capital and other resources than we have 
our competitors include national  regional and local it consulting service providers  software development firms and major accounting and consulting firms such as accenture  cap gemini  ernst young  ibm global services  keane  kforce and mps group 

table of contents in addition  we also encounter competition from numerous other businesses that provide one or more similar goods or services  including numerous resellers of internet related hardware and software and web site development companies 
our competitors may respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
our competitors may also devote greater resources than we can to the development  promotion and sale of their products and services 
they may develop products and services that are superior to or have greater market acceptance than ours 
competitors may also engage in more extensive research and development  undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to our existing and potential employees and strategic partners 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that may further impact our ability to effectively compete 
new competitors  including large computer hardware  software  professional services and other technology and telecommunications companies  may enter our markets and rapidly acquire significant market share 
as a result of increased competition and vertical and horizontal integration in the industry  we could encounter significant pricing pressures 
these pricing pressures could result in significantly lower average selling prices for our products and services 
we may not be able to offset the effects of any price reductions with an increase in the number of customers  higher revenue from consulting services  cost reductions or otherwise 
in addition  professional services businesses are likely to encounter consolidation in the near future  which could result in decreased pricing and other competition 
moreover  there is a high degree of competition among companies seeking to acquire interests in it service companies such as those we have historically targeted for acquisition 
we are and will continue to be a minor participant in the business of seeking business relationships with  and acquisitions of interests in such companies 
a large number of established and well financed entities  including venture capital firms  are active in acquiring interests in companies that we may find desirable acquisition candidates 
many of these investment oriented entities have significantly greater financial resources  technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do 
consequently  we may be at a competitive disadvantage in negotiating and executing possible investments in these entities as many competitors generally have easier access to capital  on which entrepreneur founders of privately held it service companies generally place greater emphasis  than obtaining the management skills and networking services that we can provide 
even if we are able to successfully compete with these venture capital entities  this competition may affect the terms and conditions of potential acquisitions and  as a result  we may pay more than expected for targeted companies 
if we cannot acquire interests in attractive companies on reasonable terms  our growth by acquisition strategy may not succeed 
operations interruptions caused by systems failures could adversely affect our business 
our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications hardware systems and infrastructure 
we currently maintain most of our computer systems in our facilities in new york  ny and at business unit offices in needham  ma  stoneham  ma  mason  oh  indianapolis  in  jacksonville  fl and alpharetta  ga 
interruptions could result from natural disasters  as well as power loss  telecommunications failure and similar events 
we also lease telecommunications lines from local and regional carriers  whose service may be interrupted 
any damage or failure that interrupts or delays network operations could materially and adversely affect our business 
security breaches could expose our company to a risk of loss or liability 
our infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break ins  viruses or similar problems 
if a person or entity circumvents our security measures  they could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored on our systems  misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to make significant additional investments and efforts to protect against or remedy security breaches 
security breaches that result in access to confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability 
we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or successfully integrate their operations with our own 
a key element of our expansion strategy is to grow through acquisitions 
if we identify suitable candidates  we may not be able to make investments or acquisitions on commercially acceptable terms 
acquisitions 
table of contents may cause a disruption of our ongoing business  distract management  require other resources and make it difficult to maintain our standards  controls and procedures 
we may not be able to retain key employees of the acquired companies or maintain good relations with their customers or suppliers 
we may be required to incur additional debt  and we may be required to issue equity securities  which may be dilutive to existing stockholders  to fund acquisitions 
unsuccessful acquisitions could adversely affect our business 
there can be no assurance that any completed acquisition will enhance our business 
since the normal consideration in our acquisitions comprises both cash and shares of our common stock  if we proceed with one or more significant acquisitions  the potential impacts are a substantial portion of our available cash could be used to consummate the acquisitions and or we could incur or assume significant amounts of additional indebtedness  and our stockholders could suffer significant dilution of their interest in our common stock 
also  acquisitions are required to be accounted for under the purchase method  which results in us recording significant amounts of goodwill 
the inability of a subsidiary to sustain profitability may result in an impairment loss in the value of long lived assets associated with that subsidary  principally goodwill  property and equipment  and other tangible and intangible assets 
our success depends on our retaining key personnel 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the sectors in which we operate 
the loss of existing personnel or the failure to recruit additional qualified managerial  technical  and sales personnel  as well as expenses in connection with hiring and retaining personnel  could adversely affect our business 
we also depend on the performance of our executive officers and key employees  most of whom have not entered into employment agreements 
as of december   we had full time employees 
we will need to attract  train and retain more employees for management  engineering  programming  sales and marketing  and customer service and support positions 
competition for qualified employees  particularly engineers  programmers and consultants continues to be high 
consequently  we may not be successful in attracting  training and retaining the people we need to continue to offer solutions and services to present and future customers in a cost effective manner or at all 
fluctuation in quarterly operating results may negatively impact the market price of our common stock 
our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  not all of which are within our control 
quarter to quarter comparisons of the results of operations as an indication of future performance should not be relied upon 
it is possible that in some future periods our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in that event  the market price of our common stock may fall 
factors that could cause quarterly results to fluctuate include change in customer demand for products and services  timing of the expansion of operations  changes in pricing by us or our competitors  introduction of new products or services by competitors or zanett  costs related to acquisitions of technology or businesses  recession or slow down in the us economy  or termination of customer contracts 
changes in government regulations may adversely impact our business 
there are an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet 
these laws and regulations relate to liability for information received from or transmitted over the internet  online content regulation  user privacy  taxation and quality of products and services 
the government may also seek to regulate some segments of our activities as basic telecommunications services 
moreover  the applicability to 
table of contents the internet of existing laws governing intellectual property ownership and infringement  copyright  trademark  trade secret  obscenity  libel  employment  personal privacy and other issues is uncertain and developing 
we cannot predict the impact  if any  that future regulation or regulatory changes may have on our business 
we may be faced with potential claims for liability if we cannot adequately meet our customers expectations 
our services involve development  implementation and maintenance of computer systems and computer software that are critical to the operations of our customers businesses 
our failure or inability to meet a customer s expectations in the performance of our services could harm our business reputation or result in a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for such failure or inability 
in addition  in the course of performing services  our personnel often gain access to technologies and content that includes confidential or proprietary customer information 
any such unauthorized disclosure or use could result in a claim for substantial damages 
the successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that are uninsured  exceed available insurance coverage or result in changes to our insurance policies  including premium increases or the imposition of a large deductible or co insurance requirements  could adversely affect us 
we may become subject to legal claims relating to the content in the web sites we may host or in email messages that we transmit 
the law relating to the liability of online service providers  private network operators and internet service providers for information carried on or disseminated through their networks is currently unsettled 
we may become subject to legal claims relating to the content in the web sites we may host or in email messages that we transmit 
for example  lawsuits may be brought against us claiming that material inappropriate for viewing by young children can be accessed from the web sites we may host 
claims could also involve matters such as defamation  invasion of privacy and copyright infringement 
providers of internet products and services have been sued in the past  sometimes successfully  based on the content of material 
if we have to take costly measures to reduce our exposure to these risks  or are required to defend ourselves against such claims  our business may be materially adversely affected 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of future sales by existing stockholders 
the market price of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by existing stockholders of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that these sales may occur 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to issue equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that it reflects fair value 
as of december   we had granted options to purchase  shares under our stock option plan  as listed below 
the total number of options authorized under the stock option plan  as amended  is  if the holders of these options and any other options we have issued were to exercise their rights and sell the shares issued to them  it could have an adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
the market price for our common stock has been volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market prices of the securities of it consulting companies have been especially volatile 
we have not historically paid  and do not anticipate in the foreseeable future paying cash dividends on our common stock 
we have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
instead  we intend to retain future earnings for reinvestment in our business and or to fund future acquisitions 
the concentrated ownership of our company may discourage potential transactions involving zanett 
claudio guazzoni  our chief executive officer owned approximately of the outstanding common stock as of march   and has voting power over all of the shares owned by his uncle  bruno guazzoni  
table of contents which  as of march   was  approximately of the outstanding common stock 
as a result  claudio guazzoni possesses significant influence over zanett s decision making on business matters  including the election of directors 
the concentration of zanett share ownership may delay or prevent a change in the control of zanett  impede a merger  consolidation  takeover  or other transaction involving our company  or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of zanett 
our rapid growth has strained  and may continue to strain  managerial and operational resources 
our rapid growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on managerial and operational resources 
further  as we grow  we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers  strategic partners and other third parties 
further growth or an increase in the number of strategic relationships may increase this strain on existing managerial and operational resources  inhibiting our ability to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully implement our strategy without incurring additional corporate expenses 
our future growth is dependent on producing revenue sufficient to cover increasing expenses 
expenses will increase as we build an infrastructure to implement our strategy 
we expect to hire additional employees and expand information technology systems 
we also may increase our operating expenses to broaden our support capabilities for our clients  explore acquisition opportunities and alliances with other companies  and facilitate business arrangements among our business units 
if the higher expenses are not accompanied by increased revenue  our earnings will be lower than anticipated or we may incur losses 
if we do not comply with all applicable nasdaq capital market listing requirements and nasdaq determines to delist our common stock  the delisting would adversely affect the price and liquidity of our common stock and could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities or to secure additional financing 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq capital market 
in order to maintain that listing  we must satisfy minimum financial  bid price and other requirements 
on september   we received a letter from the nasdaq notifying us that the bid price per share for our common stock had closed below the minimum bid price requirement for consecutive trading days and that  as a result  the company no longer met the nasdaq capital market s minimum bid price requirement for continued listing 
pursuant to marketplace rule c d  nasdaq provided us with calendar days to regain compliance with the rule 
on march   we received a letter from nasdaq notifying us that our common stock had not regained compliance with marketplace rule c and that we are not eligible for an additional calendar day compliance period 
the letter stated that unless we requested a hearing to appeal this determination by march   trading of our common stock would be suspended at the opening of business on march  and a form nse will be filed with the sec  which would result in the removal of the our common stock from listing and registration on nasdaq 
the letter stated that historically  nasdaq panels have generally viewed a near term reverse stock split as the only definitive plan acceptable to resolve a bid price deficiency 
on march   we sent a letter requesting a hearing to appeal the delisting determination to the nasdaq listings qualifications panel 
we expect that trading in our common stock will not be suspended before the listings qualification panel has rendered its decision 
there can be no assurances that the listings qualification panel will grant our request for continued listing 

table of contents on march  our board of directors approved a one for four reverse stock split and stock repurchase program to address this issue 
the company will seek shareholder approval of the reverse stock split at our annual meeting of shareholders 
if we fail to regain compliance the minimum bid price requirement and our common stock is ultimately delisted from trading on the nasdaq capital market  trading in our common stock may continue to be conducted on the otc bulletin board or in a non nasdaq over the counter market  such as the pink sheets 
delisting of our common stock from trading on the nasdaq capital market would adversely affect the price and liquidity of our common stock and could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities or to secure additional financing 
in that event  our common stock could also be deemed to be a penny stock under the securities enforcement and penny stock reform act of  which would require additional disclosure in connection with trade in the common stock  including the delivery of a disclosure schedule explaining the nature and risks of the penny stock market 
such requirements could further adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock

there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
however  the preparation of gaap financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following discussion reviews the critical accounting policies and items incorporated in the company s financial statements that required the use of significant management estimates 
the following listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of zanett s accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has identified revenue recognition  stock based compensation  purchase accounting  and the evaluation of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles as critical accounting policies of the company 
revenue recognition the company earns revenue primarily from it professional services 
revenues from contracts for consulting services with fees based on time and materials or cost plus are recognized as the services are performed and amounts are earned in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab  revenue recognition 
we consider revenue to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable  and payment is reasonably assured 
revenues from fixed fee contracts for professional services are recognized using contract accounting based on the estimated percentage of completion 
the percentage of completion for each contract is determined based on the ratio of costs incurred to a current estimate of total project costs since management believes this reflects the extent of contract completion 
changes in estimated costs during the course of a fixed fee contract are reflected in the period in which such facts become known 
if such changes indicate that a loss may be realized on a contract  the entire loss is recorded at such time 
on occasion  certain contracts may have substantive customer acceptance provisions 
in such cases  revenue is recognized upon receipt of acceptance from the customer 
out of pocket expenses incurred during the performance of professional service contracts are included in costs of revenues and any amounts re invoiced to customers are included in revenue during the period in which they are incurred 
unbilled revenue represents revenue for which services have been performed and costs incurred that have not yet been invoiced to the customer

r using the modified prospective method 
under this application  the company is required to record compensation expense for all awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
the company has entered into several transactions involving the issuance of shares of restricted common stock and options to purchase shares of restricted common stock to independent contractors 
the issuance of these securities required management to estimate their value using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires management to make certain estimates for values of variables used by the model 
management estimated the values for stock price volatility  the expected life of the equity instruments and the risk free rate based on information that was available to management at the time the black scholes option pricing calculations were performed 
purchase accounting in connection with its acquisitions  the company allocates the total acquisition costs to all tangible and intangible assets acquired and all liabilities assumed  with the excess purchase price recorded to goodwill 
to arrive at the allocation of the total purchase price  management makes certain assumptions in estimating the fair market value of the acquired companies tangible assets  intangible assets such as customer lists  and long term contracts and liabilities 
evaluating the carrying value of goodwill goodwill is evaluated for impairment at least annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
the assessment requires the comparison of the estimated fair value of each of the company s reporting units to the carrying value of their respective net assets  including allocated goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company must perform a second test to measure the amount of impairment 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the company allocates the fair value of a reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized by the company in an amount equal to that excess 
the estimation of fair values of each reporting unit is based on assumptions and estimates prepared by management which are highly subjective 
intangibles and long lived assets intangibles and long lived assets are stated at cost  less accumulated amortization  which is provided for by charges to income on a basis consistent with the utilization of the assets over their useful lives 
the carrying value of intangible and long lived assets are reviewed periodically by the company for the existence of facts or circumstances that may suggest impairment 
if such circumstances exist  the company estimates the future  undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset  and compare that to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated cash flows  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
the cost of intangibles is based on the estimated fair values calculated as of the date of acquisition of the related company 
such estimates are based on highly subjective estimates made by management

however  due to scheduled debt maturity the company requires additional capital or other sources of financing in order to meet its commitments 
if necessary we will explore other sources of capital  to fund future acquisitions and provide additional working capital 
there can be no assurance that additional funding will be available for us to finance our acquisition strategy 
further  due to the recent trading price of our common stock and the possibility of nasdaq delisting our common stock if we do not regain compliance with minimum listing standards of the nasdaq capital market  completion of a financing could be more difficult and could result in dilution to the ownership interests of existing stockholders 

table of contents in march the company sold the outstanding common stock of pdi for cash to kor electronics 
this transaction resulted in a cash payment of million with a holdback amount of  due march  with these proceeds the company was able to pay down  in related party debt including the march  and march  notes payable to bruno guazzoni described above and approximately  of short term debt 
this provided working capital availability over  the company believes that the existing working capital is more than sufficient to cover its day to day needs 
to further minimize cash outlays  we expect to continue to supplement compensation for both existing and new employees with equity incentives where possible 
we believe that this strategy provides the ability to increase stockholder value  as well as utilize cash resources more effectively 
to support this strategy  the stockholders of the company  at its annual meeting in june  approved an amendment to the zanett  inc incentive stock plan stock plan that increased the number of equity securities that can be issued under the plan from  shares to  shares 
while this increase allows us greater flexibility in its use of stock based compensation  the issuance of equity securities under the stock plan may result in dilution to existing stockholders 
the company s board of directors authorized a stock repurchase plan effective may  that allows us to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock from time to time in open market transactions 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of  none of these shares were repurchased in or these shares are reflected as treasury stock on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company enters into many contractual and commercial undertakings during the normal course of business 
also  all of our acquisitions were structured with additional contingent purchase price obligations that may be payable if the subsidiaries achieve certain annual performance requirements 
the company s liquidity could also be impacted by its concentration of credit risk associated with its bank accounts and accounts receivable  as follows we maintain our cash balances and money market instruments with three separate institutions of high credit quality to minimize our exposure 
we believe that any credit risk associated with its receivables is minimal due to the size and credit worthiness of our customers  which are principally large domestic corporations 
during  no one customer accounted for more than of revenues
