table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company s most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
these policies include estimates and significant judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expense  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company continues to evaluate its estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
by their nature  these policies require management to make its most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates on matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the case of the company s critical accounting policies  these estimates and judgments are based on its historical experience  terms of existing contracts  the company s observance of trends in the industry  information provided by its customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the company believes the following accounting policies and estimates require management to make the most difficult judgments in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and accordingly are critical

revenue related to product sales is recognized upon shipment provided that title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and customer acceptance criteria  if any  have been successfully demonstrated 
for product sales with acceptance criteria that are not successfully demonstrated prior to shipment  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance  provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the company s sales contracts generally provide for the customer to accept title and risk of loss when the product leaves the company s facilities 
when shipping terms or local laws do not allow for passage of title and risk of loss at the shipping point  the company defers recognizing revenue until title and risk of loss transfer to the customer

if an arrangement includes undelivered elements that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  the company defers that fair value of the undelivered elements with the residual revenue allocated to the delivered elements 
fair value is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if there is not sufficient evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  no revenue is allocated to the delivered elements and the total consideration received is deferred until delivery of those elements for which objective and reliable evidence of the fair value is not available 
maintenance or service revenues are recognized ratably over the life of the contract 
for business units that sell software licenses or products in which the software is considered more than incidental  the company recognizes revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa s statement of position sop  software revenue recognition

license revenue is recognized upon delivery  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  no significant obligations with regard to installation or implementation remain  fees are fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable  and customer acceptance  when applicable  is obtained 
the company allocates revenue first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and then allocates the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
hardware and software maintenance is marketed under annual and multi year arrangements and revenue is recognized ratably over the contracted maintenance term 
the company provides engineering services to some of its customers on a contractual basis and recognizes revenue using the percentage of completion method 
the company generally estimates the progress towards completion on contracts with a fixed fee arrangement on a monthly basis utilizing costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs at completion of the project or on a milestone basis  as appropriate 
if the company does not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion  revenue and related costs are deferred and recognized upon completion of the contract 
when total cost estimates exceed total revenues  the company accrues for the estimated losses immediately 
deferred revenue is comprised of maintenance and other service revenues for which payment has been received and for which services have not yet been performed  and revenues related to delivered components of a multiple element arrangement for which voe  or vsoe  of fair value is not available for components not yet delivered or accepted by the customer

r  the company is required to record compensation cost for all share based payments granted after the date of adoption based on the grant date fair value  estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  and for the unvested portion of all share based payments previously granted that remain outstanding based on the grant date fair value  estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no

the company recognizes the associated share based compensation on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of the awards  net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical pre vesting forfeitures and are updated on the vesting dates to reflect actual forfeitures 
the choice of a valuation technique  and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions for that technique  involve significant judgments 
these judgments reflect management s assessment of the most accurate method of valuing the stock options the company issues  based on the company s historical experience  knowledge of current conditions  and beliefs of what could occur in the future given available information 
the company s judgments could change over time as additional information becomes available  or the facts underlying its assumptions change over time  and any change in the company s judgments could have a material effect on its financial statements 
management believes that its estimates incorporate all relevant information and represent a reasonable approximation in light of the difficulties involved in valuing non traded stock options 

table of contents inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  product life cycles  and changes in technology 
a variety of methodologies are used to determine the amount of inventory reserves necessary for excess and obsolete inventory 
write downs are based upon the age of the inventory  lower of cost or market  along with significant management judgments concerning future demands for the inventory 
if actual demand for the company s products is less than its estimates  or the company experiences a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  additional write downs for existing inventories might be recorded in future periods

the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within expectations and provisions established  there is no guarantee that the company will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
since the accounts receivable are concentrated among relatively few customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of accounts receivable and future operating results 
warranty reserve the company provides for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time products are shipped 
although the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  its warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred to correct product failures 
should actual product failure rates or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates which are based on specific warranty claims  historical data  and engineering estimates  where applicable  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
such revisions could adversely affect the company s operating results 
generally  the company warrants that its products will perform in all material respects in accordance with its standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery of the products to the customer for a period ranging from to months from the date of delivery 
investments in and advances to affiliated companies the company has investments in companies whose business relates to the company s strategic focus 
investments in companies over which the company has the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the equity method if the company s ownership interest ranges from to 
investments in companies over which the company does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for under the cost method 
in assessing the recoverability of these investments  the company must make certain assumptions and judgments based upon changes in the company s overall business strategy  the financial condition of the affiliated companies  market conditions  and the industry and economic environment in which the entities operate 

table of contents business combinations the company applies the purchase accounting method to account for business combinations  which requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities purchased  with the excess value  if any  being classified as goodwill 
for those assets with finite lives  useful lives are assigned to those intangibles and their values are amortized over their remaining life 
the company reviews the intangible assets and their related useful lives as events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
the company may conduct more frequent impairment assessments if certain conditions exist  including a change in the competitive landscape  any internal decisions to pursue new or different technology strategies  a loss of a significant customer  or a significant change in the market place including changes in the prices paid for the company s products or changes in the size of the market for the company s products 
an impairment results if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the sum of the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and disposition of the asset 
the amount of the impairment would be determined by comparing the carrying value to the fair value of the asset 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the present value of the estimated future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate 
the projection of the future cash flows and the selection of a discount rate require significant management judgment 
the key variables that management must estimate include sales volume  prices  inflation  product costs  capital expenditures  and sales and marketing costs 
for developed technology patents and other technology that have not been deployed  the company also must estimate the likelihood of both pursuing a particular strategy and the level of expected market adoption 
the company will perform annual reviews in its second quarter of each fiscal year for impairment of goodwill related to the acquisition of copley or future acquisitions or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill may be considered to be impaired if the company determines that the carrying value of the reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds the reporting unit s fair value 
assessing the impairment of goodwill requires the company to make assumptions and judgments regarding the fair value of the net assets of its reporting units 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units using a combination of valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and cash earnings multiples  and compares the values to its estimated overall market capitalization 
intangible assets and other long lived assets intangible assets consist of intellectual property  licenses  capitalized software  and certain identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations  including trade names  customer relationships  backlog  and developed technology 
other long lived assets consist primarily of property  plant  and equipment 
these assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic life 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair market value determined by either a quoted market price  if any  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow technique 
evaluation of impairment of long lived assets requires estimates of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of long lived assets could differ from the estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
these differences could result in impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
income taxes the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions within which it operates 
this process involves assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the 
table of contents balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that recovery is not more than likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established  the company must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  the provision for income taxes and results of operations could be materially impacted 
the company establishes liabilities for possible assessments by taxing authorities resulting from known tax exposures including  but not limited to  certain tax credits and various federal  state  and foreign tax matters 
the company does not provide for us federal income taxes on undistributed earnings of all consolidated foreign subsidiaries  as such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in those operations 
determination of the potential deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable because such liability  if any  is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs

these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
the company s primary exposure is related to fluctuations between the us dollar and local currencies for the company s subsidiaries in canada and europe 
the company s cash and investments include cash equivalents  which the company considers to be investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
investments having original maturities in excess of three months are stated at amortized cost  which approximates fair value  and are classified as held to maturity 
total interest income for fiscal year was  an interest rate change of would not have a material impact on the fair value of the portfolio or on future earnings
