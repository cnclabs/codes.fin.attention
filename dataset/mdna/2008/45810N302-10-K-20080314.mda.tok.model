all periods affected by this error have been restated throughout this document 
in december  we determined that we no longer needed a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets generated by net operating loss carry forwards of prior years

through september   we marketed pharmaceutical products directly to patients throughout our network and we had contracted with a third party pharmacy to provide certain business services related to the distribution of and accounting for these sales 
effective october   this agreement was terminated and replaced by a new agreement between us and the pharmacy 
under the terms of the new agreement  we were no longer a direct distributor of pharmaceutical products to patients as this function is being performed directly by the pharmacy 
our responsibilities are currently limited to marketing the products for which we receive marketing fees 
this compensation approximates our previous contribution from those pharmaceutical sales and services  and will be shown on a net rather than gross basis 
as a result  as of october   we no longer record pharmaceutical sales  the related cost of sales and other costs related to pharmaceutical distribution 
as anticipated  this change has resulted in a significant decrease in pharmaceutical revenues and cost of sales  however assuming the same volume of pharmaceutical products is distributed contribution from operations and income before income taxes  as well as net income  has been virtually unaffected by this contract change 
significant accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements

total other expenses income from operations before income taxes income tax provision net income revenues for the year ended december   total revenues of million increased approximately million  or from the same period in we experienced revenue increases in both of our legacy operating segments 
our fertility centers revenue increased as a result of growth within the underlying medical practices  and the addition of one new partner arrangement and the expansion of the shady grove contract in expansion continued in our consumer services segment  driven primarily by the growth of its shared risk refund program 
in addition to organic and acquisition growth in these two segments  on august   we acquired vein clinics of america  inc this leading provider of vein disease treatment became our third operating segment and contributed million to our revenues since its acquisition 
for the year ended december   the total revenues of million were lower by million  or from the same period in saw continued expansion of our fertility center operations with revenues up million or from levels  and the shared risk refund revenue was up million or from the prior year 
increases in both operations are generally attributable to higher patient flow as a result of increased marketing efforts 
these increases were offset by a million reduction of revenues in the pharmaceutical operations due to a contractual change with the third party pharmacy we use to process and fulfill orders 
as previously disclosed  effective october   we relieved ourselves of the responsibility for being a direct distributor of pharmaceutical products to patients by transferring this obligation directly to the pharmacy and no longer record the sales revenues or related costs 
while our new fee structure resulted in a significant decrease in pharmaceutical revenues and cost of sales  our net income as a result of this contract change  has been virtually unaffected by this contract change 
a segment by segment discussion is presented below 
fertility centers segment in providing clinical care to patients  each of our partner practices generates patient revenue which we do not report in our financial statements 
although we do not consolidate the physician fertility practice financials with our own  these financials do directly affect our revenues 
the components of our revenue from each of the partner practices are o a base service fee calculated as a percentage of patient revenue as reported by the partner practice this percentage varies from down to depending on the level of patient revenues  o cost of services equal to reimbursement for the expenses which we advanced to the partner practice during the month representing substantially all of the expenses incurred by the practice  o our additional fees which represent our share of the net income of the partner practice which varies from to or a fixed amount depending on the partner practice 
in addition to these revenues generated from our fertility centers  we often receive miscellaneous other revenues related to providing services to medical practices 
from the total of our revenues  we subtract the annual amortization of our business service rights  which are the rights to provide business services to each of the partner practices 
fertility center revenues in the year ended december   increased by million or from the same period in this compares to an increase of million  or for the year ended december  over during both years  growth was largely attributable to organic year over year growth in our network of underlying medical practices 
influencing this growth is our focus on increasing patient revenues through effective marketing programs  and focus on expense management which drives operational efficiency and higher contribution margins 
revenues for the year ended december   also benefited from the addition of our newest fertility partner in orlando  florida and the expansion of shady grove to the baltimore  maryland market 
these new arrangements became effective on july and september  and generated more than million in revenues for us in the table below illustrates the components of the fertility centers segment revenue in relation to the physician practice financials for  and s omitted caption twelve months ending december  physician financials

the following summarized quarterly financial data for  and is presented for additional analysis and demonstration of the slight seasonality of the fertility division 
the volumes in the first quarter of each year are typically lower than the balance of the year as many patients do not wish to prepare for the ivf procedure in the last month of the year resulting in fewer ivf ready patients in january and february 
contributing to the lower volumes are voluntary laboratory closures at year end at several of our labs to undergo normal maintenance

consumer services segment for the year ended december   revenues of million from our shared risk refund program represented over of our consumer services segment revenues 
this compares to revenues of million  or of consumer services revenues in revenue growth of million or is a result of enrolling more patients into the program and maintaining high pregnancy success rates 
revenues from our affiliate program were million for the year  which is unchanged from the prior year 
although our affiliate program produces significant revenues on a stand alone basis  it also serves as a distribution channel for our shared risk refund program and often serves as an introduction to our services for medical practices which move on to become full fertility partners 
as a result of these financial and strategic opportunities  we are dedicating resources and targeting this program for expansion in coming years 
pharmaceutical revenue of million for the year ended december   was down approximately million from the prior period 
this decline is a result of decreasing margins due to pharmaceutical cost increases which are not able to be passed on to the consumer as a result of competitive pressures 
we view these cost and pricing developments as longer term market developments and do not expect significant improvement during for the year ended december   the revenues of the shared risk refund program grew million or over the growth came from increased patient enrollments  higher pregnancy rates and the expansion of the program to additional affiliated clinics 
the revenues from our affiliate program of million were million higher than due to the net addition of three clinics 
the pharmaceutical revenue was million while the revenue was million 
as previously discussed  the reduction is a result of contract changes made in vein clinics segment revenues for the year ended december   represent operating results since this segment was purchased on august  vein clinic revenues are generally from billings to patients or their insurer for vein disease treatment services  as opposed to the service fees and reimbursed costs earned by our fertility centers segment 
revenues reported by vca on a stand alone basis for the twelve months ended december  were million

vca operated clinics at the end of and at the end of contribution for the year ended december   total contribution of million was up approximately million  or from the same period in the accelerated contribution growth we experienced in our fertility centers segment in was the result of organic and acquisition growth as well as an improvement in profitability of our partner practices 
the continued growth of our shared risk refund program and the acquisition of vein clinics of america in august were also major contributors to the improvement 
offsetting this growth to some degree  was the continuing reduction in contribution from our pharmaceutical sales 
for the year ended december   contribution growth was million  or  versus the comparable period in the contribution growth rate for the year ending december   versus the same period in  of was significantly affected by a contractual pricing adjustment with one of our fertility partners which lowered our contribution by approximately million 
in the absence of this pricing adjustment  operating contribution growth in our fertility and consumer segments would have been 
a segment by segment discussion is presented below 
fertility centers segment fertility center contribution for the full year of increased by approximately million  or from the same period in the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to the continued revenue and margin growth of our existing fertility centers  and our new fertility markets in baltimore  maryland and orlando  florida 
contribution growth rates for our existing partners averaged in  versus the prior year 
our new markets entered into during the second half of generated contribution of more than  the fertility center contribution was million  a reduction of million from the million reported in despite higher revenues  the decrease was a result of reaching agreement on a contractual fee cap at one of the practices  reaching the final stage of a phased in fee reduction at three other clinics and additional general and administrative costs designed to support future revenue growth 
consumer services segment contribution of million from our consumer services segment in the year ending december   was essentially even with the million earned in the prior year 
contribution gains from our growing shared risk refund program  up million  or  were largely offset by continuing declines in our pharmaceutical lines  down million  or 
our pharmaceutical sales have been impacted by an unfavorable pricing and reimbursement environment and returned total contribution for the year ended december   of slightly over million 
going forward we expect this segment s contribution to generally reflect only that of our shared risk refund program 
the contribution of the shared risk refund program rose million or  to million compared to million for higher volumes through increased enrollments as well as favorable pregnancy outcomes in the early treatment cycles drove this performance 
pharmaceutical contribution of million  down million from was caused by manufacturer price increases that could not be passed on to the consumer 
vein clinics segment vein clinics contribution was of their revenue for the period from their acquisition on august  to december  start up and infrastructure costs associated with our strategy of opening new clinics is impacting this segment s short term performance 
as previously disclosed  we do not expect this acquisition to be accretive to earnings until general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses are comprised of salaries  benefits  administrative  regulatory compliance  and operational support costs which are not specifically related to individual division operations or other product offerings 
these costs were approximately  and of contribution for the three years ending december   and  respectively 
this declining ratio reflects our continuing efforts to actively manage g a expenses in an effort to drive economies of scale from growth in total contribution 
interest our previously disclosed acquisition of vein clinics of america resulted in a use of approximately million of cash from our balance sheet in addition to million of new borrowings 
despite this use of balance sheet cash  average cash balances in exceeded those of the prior year resulting in an increase in interest income of  or  compared to the same period in due to declining interest rates experienced in early and the expectation of even lower rates later in the year  interest income will be lower in the near term 
interest income of million for the year ended december  exceeded that of the prior year by  or million as a result of both higher average cash balances  as well as a higher level of general interest rates 
for the year ended december   interest expense increased by  or million  from the same period in this increase is directly related to higher debt levels associated with financing our vein clinic acquisition  which resulted in net additional borrowings of approximately million 
interest expense in the next few years will be higher as the additional million of debt was only outstanding since august  for the year ended december   interest expense increased by  or million  from the same period in this decrease was the result of reduced debt level due to scheduled debt payments 
income tax provision our provision for income tax was approximately million  million and million for the three years ended december   and respectively  or  and of pre tax income  respectively 
our effective tax rates for all years reflect provisions for both federal and state income taxes 
the lower effective tax rate for the year ended december  is mainly due to an  tax benefit related to the elimination of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
we expect the effective tax rate to approximate in effective january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no

fin r consolidation of variable interest entities vie s addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
as of december   through the acquisition of the vein clinics of america  inc  we have interests in the individual vein clinics  where we are the primary beneficiary 
as such we have consolidated these vein clinic operations in our financial statements in accordance with the provisions of fin r 
since we do not have any interest in the individual fertility clinics and we are not the primary beneficiary  we do not consolidate the results of the fertility clinics in our accounts 
also  since we do not have any interest in the captive insurance provider where we are not the primary beneficiary  we do not consolidate the results of the captive insurance company in our accounts liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents on hand as compared to million at december  we had negative working capital of approximately million  at december   a decrease of million from working capital of million as of december  this change reflects our use of cash in the vein clinics of america acquisition 
shared risk revenue and other patient deposits  which are reflected as a current liability  represent funds received from patients in advance of treatment cycles and are an indication of future revenues 
these deposits totaled approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these deposits are a significant source of cash flow and represent interest free financing for us 
as of december   we did not have any significant contractual commitments for the acquisition of fixed assets or construction of leasehold improvements 
however  we anticipate upcoming capital expenditures of approximately million in these expenditures are primarily related to medical equipment  information system infrastructure and leasehold improvements 
we believe that our current working capital level  specifically cash and cash equivalents  is at adequate levels to fund our operations and our commitments for fixed asset acquisitions 
we also believe that the cash flows from our operations plus our available credit facility will be sufficient to provide for our future liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
in august   as part of our acquisition of vein clinics of america  we secured a new million year term loan 
our previous term loan of million was paid off in its entirety as part of this agreement 
after deducting the previous loan amount  interest and fees  our net funding from bank of america was million 
other features of this credit facility include a million three year revolving line of credit 
as of december   there was no balance outstanding under this revolving line of credit 
each component of our amended credit facility bears interest by reference to bank of america s prime rate or libor  at our option  plus a margin  which is dependent upon a leverage test  ranging from to in the case of libor based loans 
prime based loans are made at bank of america s prime rate and do not contain an additional margin 
interest on the prime based loans is payable quarterly beginning november  and interest on libor based loans is payable on the last day of each applicable interest period 
as of december   interest on the term loan was payable at a rate of approximately 
unused amounts under the working capital revolver bear a commitment fee of and are payable quarterly 
availability of borrowings under the working capital revolver is based on eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the credit agreement 
as of december  under the revolving line of credit the full amount of million was available  of which none was outstanding 
in order to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with our new term loan  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with bank of america in august for of the loan amount 
the effect of this swap transaction was to effectively fix the interest rate on our term loan at plus the applicable margin for the life of the loan 
our bank of america credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
as of december   we were in full compliance with all applicable debt covenants 
we also continuously review our credit agreements and may renew  revise or enter into new agreements from time to time as deemed necessary

we also have commitments to provide working capital financing to member clinics in our fertility centers division 
a significant portion of this commitment relates to our transactions with the medical practices themselves 
our responsibilities to the these medical practices are to provide financing for their accounts receivable and to hold patient deposits on their behalf as well as undistributed physician earnings 
disbursements to the medical practices generally occur monthly 
the medical practice s repayment hierarchy consists of the following o we provide a cash credit to the practice for billings to patients and insurance companies  o we reduce the cash credit for clinic expenses that we have incurred on behalf of the practice  o we reduce the cash credit for the base portion of our service fee which relates to the partner revenues  o we reduce the cash credit for the variable portion of our service fee which relates to the partner earnings  o we disburse to the medical practice the remaining cash amount which represents the physician s undistributed earnings 
we are also responsible for the collection of the partner accounts receivables  which we finance with full recourse 
we continuously fund these needs from our cash flow from operations  the collection of prior months receivables and deposits from patients in advance of treatment 
if delays in repayment are incurred  which have not as yet been encountered  we could draw on our existing working capital line of credit 
we also make payments on behalf of the partner for which we are reimbursed in the short term 
other than these payments  as a general course  we do not make other advances to the medical practice 
we have no other funding commitments to the partner 
recently issued accounting pronouncements please see note of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on recently issued accounting pronouncements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business our interest income and expense items are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
during the third quarter of we entered into a derivative transaction designed to hedge a portion of our variable interest rate term loan 
as a result of this derivative transaction we have partially shielded ourselves from interest rate risks associated with that portion of this loan as the hedge instrument essentially converts that portion of the loan to a fixed rate instrument 
we are currently subject to interest rate risks associated with the remaining portion of our term loan as well as our short term investments and certain advances to our fertility partner clinics  all of which are tied to either short term interest rates  libor or the prime rate 
as of december   a one percent change in interest rates would impact our pre tax income by approximately  annually
