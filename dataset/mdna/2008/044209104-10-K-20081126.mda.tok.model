total consolidated revenue for the years ended september   and as a percent of revenue by business segment was as follows sales and operating revenues by business segment performance materials distribution valvoline water technologies m key developments during  the following operational decisions and economic developments had an impact on ashland s current and future cash flows  results of operations and financial position 
hercules acquisition in november  ashland completed the acquisition of hercules  a significant step in achieving its objective to create a leading  global specialty chemicals company 
as fiscal commences  the new combined company comprises a core of three specialty chemical businesses specialty additives and functional ingredients  paper and water technologies  and specialty resins  which will drive ashland both strategically and financially 
this acquisition better positions ashland to deliver more stable and predictable earnings  generate stronger cash flows and gain access to higher growth markets worldwide 
as a result of the transaction  the expanded international presence of ashland will increase revenue derived outside north america to roughly from approximately in fiscal ashland s new structure  incorporating the former hercules businesses  is composed of five commercial units ashland hercules water technologies  ashland aqualon functional ingredients aqualon  ashland performance materials  ashland distribution and ashland consumer markets valvoline 
the restructured ashland hercules water technologies business will be a global supplier of functional and process chemicals for the paper industry in addition to water treatment chemicals 
aqualon is a manufacturer and supplier of specialty additives and functional ingredients derived from renewable resources that are designed to manage the properties of water based systems 
the estimated transaction value of billion includes billion of debt assumed in the acquisition 
as part of the financing arrangement for the transaction  ashland borrowed billion and retained approximately billion in existing debt  combining for a projected weighted average interest rate of approximately 
for further information on this transaction see the liquidity discussion within management s discussion and analysis as well as note q in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
raw material volatility unprecedented volatility in many hydrocarbon and base lube oil markets caused unusually large fluctuations in gross profit margins throughout fiscal this volatility was highlighted during the summer  which saw the crude oil market soar to over per barrel from approximately per barrel at the end of fiscal these significant raw material increases caused tight supply and extreme price increases on core raw material commodities in a very short period of time 
the timing delay of implementing price increases on ashland s products in the market place to recapture gross profit margin from these significant increases caused overall gross profit margin erosion during the year in each of ashland s businesses 
working capital and cash flow management ashland s commitment to the implementation of its sap enterprisewide resource planning erp project was only the first step in efforts to improve working capital and cash flow management 
the majority of ashland s operations had implemented this system by the beginning of fiscal  resulting in real time information which provided greater transparency in cash management and related business decisions 
as a result  focus shifted on improving the cash flow metric in by tying cash flow results directly to management compensation 
ashland s efforts and focus in this area were highly successful in fiscal as it generated million of cash flows from operations  a million increase from the prior year 
operating segment trade working capital decreased from of revenue at september  to of revenue at september  improvements in this area were largely driven by inventory optimization in ashland distribution  but also from attention to accounts receivable collection across all business units 
overall  trade working capital provided approximately million in cash flow during cost structure efficiency program during  ashland initiated a cost structure efficiency program designed to realign its available resources within certain businesses to maximize operating income and long term growth opportunities 
ashland committed to achieve million in total savings from existing businesses by the end of fiscal when the program was introduced  the company run rate target for fiscal was million 
ashland exceeded this initial target by the end of fiscal  achieving total run rate savings of million 
these cost savings were primarily within performance materials and water technologies  where run rate savings of million and million  respectively  were achieved 
m map settlement during  ashland and marathon agreed to a tax related settlement with respect to four specific tax attributes and deductions that were originally scheduled to be reimbursed periodically at much later points in the future  some with the potential of greater than years or more 
the effect of this settlement accelerated marathon s reimbursement to ashland for certain of these deductions  resulting in the receipt of million in cash from marathon representing the present value of the future deductions 
as a result of this specific agreement  ashland recorded a gain within the map transaction caption of the statement of consolidated income of million during results of operations consolidated review ashland s net income amounted to million in  million in and million in income from continuing operations  which excludes results from discontinued operations  amounted to million in  million in and million in net income is primarily affected by results within operating income  net interest and other financing income and discontinued operations 
ashland s operating income amounted to million in  million in and million in operating results in compared to declined slightly as operating income decreases in performance materials and water technologies were offset by an operating income increase in distribution and income associated with unallocated and other 
increases in operating income during compared to primarily related to valvoline s record operating income year as distribution  and to a lesser extent performance materials  reported lower operating results 
net interest and other financing income was million in  million in and million in the decrease in compared to prior periods primarily reflects the lower interest rate environment for short term investment instruments 
ashland s after tax results from discontinued operations included a gain on the sale of apac of million in  which was subsequently reduced by million in both and  a million gain associated with estimated future asbestos liabilities less probable recoveries during and net income from apac operations of million in a comparative analysis of the statement of consolidated income by caption is provided as follows for the years ended september   and in millions change change sales and operating revenues revenues for increased from primarily due to increased pricing of million and million related to a favorable currency exchange as well as million from the acquisition of the pressure sensitive adhesive business and atmospheric emulsions business of air products and chemicals  inc air products within performance materials in june 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease related to declines in both volume and product mix as well as an additional million decrease related to the elimination of a one month financial reporting lag for foreign operations reporting lag during during  pricing increases were consistently implemented across each of ashland s businesses to recover significant cost increases occurring within volatile raw material markets 
volume only declined slightly  despite the difficult market conditions that continued to deteriorate the north american economy throughout  particularly in core sectors such as building and construction  coatings  transportation and marine 
the favorable currency exchange rate is principally influenced by the us dollar s usd performance against the euro  which weakened by during revenues for increased from primarily as a result of water technologies purchase of the water treatment business from degussa ag in may as revenues associated with these purchased operations were million in  as compared to million in the prior year included only five months of business activity due to the purchase date 
revenues in also included an additional million as a result of the elimination of the reporting lag during as compared to these increases  along with pricing increases within valvoline  primarily contributed to the overall increase in revenues 
in millions change change cost of sales and operating expenses gross profit as a percent of sales cost of sales and operating expenses cost of sales for increased compared to  which resulted in an overall decline in gross profit as a percent of sales gross profit 
raw material price increases were the primary factor m for this gross profit decline  which represented a million cost increase compared to volatile pricing in raw materials  particularly in the crude oil market  which experienced an approximate increase in the cost per barrel of oil during before peaking at over a barrel  primarily influenced other significant hydrocarbon based raw material increases throughout currency exchange rates increased cost of sales million  while the air products acquisition added an additional million 
these revenue increases were partially offset by a million decrease related to volume declines and product mix as well as a million decline related to the reporting lag elimination during cost of sales for increased compared to  yet gross profit remained consistent year over year 
cost of sales fluctuations generally track revenue as the increase from to primarily reflected year over year raw material cost increases 
gross profit declined in three of ashland s four business segments over the same period  with the exception being valvoline due to timely and effective pricing increases 
fiscal also included an additional million in cost of sales as compared to as a result of the reporting lag elimination 
in millions change change selling  general and administrative expenses as a of revenues selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased slightly compared to while decreasing one percentage point as a percent of total revenue 
expenses impacting the comparability of compared to include charges recorded in that consisted of million for the voluntary severance offer  million for the elimination of the reporting lag and million related to an expense for certain postretirement plans 
these expenses did not occur in expenses during were negatively impacted by million for currency exchange and million for severance charges  related to realignment of certain businesses within ashland during during selling  general and administrative expenses increased  however remained consistent as a percent of revenue from period to period 
the charges of million for the voluntary severance offer  million for the elimination of the reporting lag  million for the postretirement plans and the additional expense related to the degussa acquisition were the primary increases in expenses year over year 
corporate costs previously allocated to apac of million were retained within expenses in accordance with applicable gaap guidance 
in millions change change equity and other income equity income other income total equity and other income increased during and during compared to the prior period 
the increases in and primarily relate to improved performance from various foreign joint venture associations 
in millions change change gain loss on the map transaction the million gain in primarily related to a settlement with marathon for certain related tax matters associated with the map transaction which resulted in a million gain 
this gain was offset by a decrease in the recorded receivable from marathon for the estimated present value of future tax deductions related primarily to environmental and other postretirement obligations 
ashland recorded a loss on the map transaction of million in as a result of a decrease in the discounted receivable from marathon for the estimated present value of future tax deductions 
in  a million loss resulted primarily from a million reclassification of certain tax benefits related to previously owned businesses of ashland 
the offsetting benefit was recorded in income taxes as deferred tax benefits 
see note c of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the map transaction 
m in millions change change net interest and other financing income interest income interest expense other financing costs the decrease in interest income to million in from million in and primarily reflects the lower interest rate environment for short term investment instruments compared to prior periods 
interest expense and other financial costs have remained consistent across all periods 
in millions change change income tax expense effective tax rate the overall effective tax rate significantly increased in from rates in prior periods due to several key factors 
significant volatility in the capital markets as it relates to investments held for life insurance policies resulted in a million tax effect in  which historically has been a tax benefit for ashland 
in addition  during ashland recorded a million tax benefit related to dividends held within the employee stock ownership plan compared with a million tax benefit in  primarily due to the special dividend of paid on october  as part of the distribution to shareholders of a substantial portion of the apac divestiture proceeds 
ashland s income tax expense for and included million of tax expense and million of tax benefits  respectively  due to the resolution of domestic and foreign tax matters and the reevaluation of income tax reserves related to tax positions taken in prior years 
also during  million in tax benefits were recorded to adjust the tax provision to the tax returns as ultimately filed 
excluding these identified items  ashland s effective tax rate would have been in  compared to in and in see note k of notes to consolidated financial statements for the reconciliation of ashland s tax provision for the last three years to the us statutory rate 
in millions change change income loss from discontinued operations net of tax apac income from operations loss gain on sale of operations asbestos related litigation reserves electronic chemicals ashland recorded an after tax gain on the sale of apac of million in during and  subsequent tax adjustments of million per year reduced the gain on the sale of apac 
ashland periodically updates the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos related litigation reserves  which resulted in a net million and million charge in and  respectively  and a favorable net million adjustment during in addition  ashland reassessed its assumption for a certain asbestos receivable due to improved credit quality  which resulted in a favorable million after tax adjustment during net income from the results of operations of apac amounted to million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the following details ashland s quarterly reported operating income for the years ended september   and m in millions quarterly operating income december march june september results of operations business segment review segment operating results reflect the methodology adopted in october for allocating substantially all budgeted corporate expenses to ashland s operating businesses  with the exception of certain legacy costs or items clearly not associated with the operating divisions 
corporate expenses allocated to ashland s four operating divisions under this methodology amounted to million in  million in and million in actual corporate expenses incurred throughout the year are recorded within unallocated and other 
in august the sale of apac qualified as a discontinued operation 
under generally accepted accounting principles  allocations of general corporate overhead may not be allocated to discontinued operations for financial statement presentation 
as a result  the unallocated and other component of operating income during reflects million of corporate overhead previously allocated to apac 
the following table shows revenues  operating income and operating information by business segment for each of the last three years ended september in millions sales and operating revenues performance materials distribution valvoline water technologies intersegment sales operating income performance materials distribution valvoline water technologies unallocated and other a operating information performance materials b sales per shipping day pounds sold per shipping day gross profit as a percent of sales distribution b sales per shipping day pounds sold per shipping day gross profit as a percent of sales valvoline b lubricant sales gallons premium lubricants percent of us branded volumes gross profit as a percent of sales water technologies b sales per shipping day gross profit as a percent of sales a includes a million charge for costs associated with ashland s voluntary severance offer in and corporate costs previously allocated to apac of million in b sales are defined as sales and operating revenues 
gross profit is defined as sales and operating revenues  less cost of sales and operating expenses 
m during  ashland s financial performance was hindered by declining demand and significant raw material cost increases  a direct result of continued weakness in the north american economy  where approximately of revenue is derived  and instability in raw material markets 
this economic environment created significant downward pressure on the gross profit margin of each business segment  particularly within the performance materials  valvoline and water technologies businesses during despite the economic weakness and gross profit margin pressure  distribution was able to keep gross profit as a percent of sales relatively flat compared to overall volume results during for the businesses were mixed  with water technologies and valvoline reporting modest increases compared to while distribution declined slightly and performance materials levels were flat 
performance materials performance materials reported operating income of million during  a decrease from the million reported during revenues increased to  million compared to  million during the prior period 
increases in currency exchange of million  or  and price of million  or  were the primary factors in the increase in revenue 
in addition  the acquisition of air products in june contributed million to revenues 
these increases in revenue were partially offset by volume and product mix decreases of million  or  primarily as a result of weakness in the north american markets for the composite polymers and specialty polymers and adhesives business units  and a million decrease related to the reporting lag elimination recorded during the decrease in volume and product mix caused operating income to decline by million 
gross profit as a percent of sales during decreased percentage points to primarily due to raw material cost increases of million 
these raw material cost increases were not fully offset by price increases during  causing gross profit margin and operating income to decline by million 
the decreases in gross profit margin related to price  volume and product mix were partially offset by an increase from currency exchange of million 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  during as an million increase in currency exchange was offset by a million decrease in costs recorded from the reporting lag recorded during equity and other income increased million during compared to  primarily due to a million increase in equity income associated with joint ventures 
performance materials reported operating income of million for  a decrease compared to the record million for the gross profit margin decreased to from in  resulting in an million decrease in operating income 
sales and operating revenues increased  from  million for to  million for  primarily due to price increases  as pounds per shipping day were flat for both periods at million pounds 
on a comparable twelve month period  when adjusted for the acquisitions of northwest coatings and the purchase of third party ownership interests in a former japanese joint venture  sales and operating revenues increased while volumes decreased 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or compared to the period  primarily due to increased international expansion as well as million of additional costs from the previously mentioned acquisitions 
distribution distribution reported operating income of million during  a increase from the million reported during revenues increased to  million compared to  million in the prior period 
price increases  primarily in certain chemicals and plastics  were the primary factor in revenue growth causing a million  or  increase with currency exchange increases adding an additional million  or 
these increases during were offset by a million decrease in volume  as pounds sold per shipping day decreased to million compared to million in  causing a decline in the gross profit margin and operating income of million 
the reporting lag recorded during resulted in an additional million decrease in revenue 
gross profit as a percent of sales during the current period decreased percentage point to 
despite this decline  actual gross profit margin in dollars increased million compared to as price increases offset raw material cost increases  contributing million to gross profit margin and operating income 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  during primarily due to increased charges for incentive compensation of million 
the currency exchange increased operating income by million during distribution earned operating income of million for  a decrease from the record million earned for sales and operating revenues decreased from  million for  to  million for pounds sold per shipping day decreased in to million pounds from million pounds in  resulting in a million decrease in operating income 
gross profit as a percent of sales declined from for to for two factors primarily caused this decrease 
the first was unusually high margins in the prior period  resulting from hurricane supply disruptions 
the second was the limited ability of distribution to raise prices in a rising commodity cost environment due to demand weakness in the north american manufacturing sector 
the decline in gross profit margin lowered operating income by million compared to selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  m comparing the current period to the prior period in part due to a one time million adjustment in foreign postretirement benefit obligations 
valvoline valvoline reported operating income of million during  a decrease compared to the record million reported during revenues increased to  million during compared to  million in increases in pricing of million  or  and currency exchange of million  or  contributed to the revenue growth 
in addition  revenue related to volume increased million as lubricant volume increased to million gallons during compared to  which resulted in an increase in gross profit margin and operating income of million 
a change in the product mix sold during reduced revenue by million compared to gross profit as a percent of sales during decreased percentage points to 
despite this decrease  actual gross profit margin in dollars increased million from the prior period as currency exchange contributed an increase of million while price increases did not fully offset increases in raw material costs  causing a net million decline in gross profit margin and operating income 
the remaining difference was due to fluctuations within product mix  which caused gross profit margin and operating income to decline by million 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million during the current period primarily due to currency exchange increases of million 
valvoline reported record operating income of million for  compared to an operating loss of million for the improvement in operating income primarily reflects gross profit margin recovery  which increased to in from in  as a result of stable base oil costs and the full effect of previous price increases 
this increase in gross profit margin during contributed million to operating income 
sales and operating revenues increased over the period to  million  reflecting increased pricing and product mix as volume levels decreased to million lubricant gallons 
valvoline instant oil change reported a million increase in operating income compared to the prior year driven by higher levels of customer satisfaction which contributed to an increase in same store sales revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million during primarily due to lower employee benefit costs as well as an unfavorable litigation charge recorded in the prior period 
water technologies water technologies reported operating income of million during  a decrease compared to million reported during  as lower gross profit margin and increased selling  general and administrative costs were the primary factors in this decline 
revenues increased to million compared to million during  primarily due to increases of approximately million  or  and million  or  in currency exchange and volume  respectively 
these increases were offset by an million  or  decrease in price and a million  or  decrease as a result of the reporting lag recorded in gross profit as a percent of sales decreased percentage points to 
despite this decrease  actual gross profit margin in dollars increased million from as currency exchange and volume contributed increases of million and million  respectively  to gross profit margin 
these increases in gross profit were almost fully offset by cost increases in raw materials and services of million as well as a million decrease related to the reporting lag recorded during selling  general and administrative expenses increased million during primarily due to a million increase in currency exchange and a million decrease from costs associated with the reporting lag recorded during water technologies earned operating income of million for  compared to million for  which included an million currency hedge gain related to the acquisition of the water treatment business of degussa ag e ps 
sales and operating revenues increased to million in compared to million in  primarily due to the million in sales and operating revenues contributed by the e ps business during the entire current year  which had only reported four months in the prior period 
the marine and industrial businesses combined revenue increase of  on a comparable twelve month basis  and the improving gross profit margin have been the primary factors in the operating income improvement in  while inclusion of the e ps business has also contributed to operating income growth 
operating income was also impacted during the current year by an million asset impairment charge on pathguard pathogen control equipment that was adjusted to fair value in conjunction with the decision to exit the poultry processing market 
unallocated and other unallocated and other income costs  consisting of certain legacy costs or items clearly not associated with the operating segments  were million in  million in and million in these amounts included a million benefit in for lower direct support costs allocated to each business segment  a million charge for costs associated with ashland s voluntary severance offer in and costs previously allocated to apac of million in m that were retained in this component of operating income in accordance with applicable gaap guidance 
ashland s voluntary severance offer was initiated as a result of the apac divestiture in august as a result of the divestiture  it was determined that certain identified corporate costs that had previously been allocated to that business needed to be eliminated to maintain ashland s overall competitiveness 
as a means to eliminate those costs  ashland offered an enhanced early retirement or voluntary severance opportunity to administrative and corporate employees during fiscal year in total  ashland accepted voluntary severance offers from employees under the program 
as a result  a million pretax charge was recorded for severance  pension and other postretirement benefit costs during fiscal year the termination dates for employees participating in the program were completed and paid in fiscal year in addition to the ongoing costs that typically occur each year related to formerly owned businesses  included million in expense for joint venture and other costs related to growth opportunities  which was fully offset by an million adjustment from favorable experiences related to ashland s self insurance program 
fiscal included million in reduced expenditures as well as million in income recorded from favorable experiences related to ashland s self insurance program 
included in were million in environmental remediation expenses  income of million from an insurance claim recovery and income of million from the favorable adjustment to the previously estimated withdrawal premium due oil insurance limited oil  the energy industry mutual insurance consortium in which ashland terminated its participation effective december  financial position liquidity ashland s cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the statements of consolidated cash flows  are summarized as follows 
in millions cash used provided by operating activities from continuing operations investing activities from continuing operations financing activities from continuing operations discontinued operations effect of currency exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows generated from operating activities from continuing operations  a major source of ashland s liquidity  amounted to million in  million in and million in the increased cash generated during primarily reflects a million and million cash improvement in operating assets and liabilities as compared to and  respectively 
the cash inflow for the current period was primarily attributable to changes within accounts receivable  inventory and trade and other payables as a result of ashland s increased focus on working capital management throughout the company 
these captions generated million of cash inflow during compared to cash outflows of million and million from the same captions during and during  ashland paid income taxes of million  compared to million in and million in ashland contributed million to its qualified pension plans in  compared with million in and million in cash receipts for interest income was million in and million in and  while cash payments for interest expense amounted to million in  million in and million in cash flows from discontinued operations  consisting primarily of cash flows from apac  amounted to a cash outflow of million in  million in and cash inflow of  million in during  ashland replaced its revolving credit agreement with a new five year revolving credit facility which provides for up to million in borrowings 
up to an additional million in borrowings is available with the consent of one or more of the lenders 
the borrowing capacity under this new facility was reduced by million for letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement at september  the revolving credit agreement contains a covenant limiting the total debt ashland may incur from all sources as a function of ashland s stockholders equity 
the covenant s terms would have permitted ashland to borrow billion at september  in addition to the actual total debt incurred at that time 
permissible total ashland debt under the covenant s terms increases or decreases by for any increase or decrease in stockholders equity 
m on november   ashland completed its acquisition of hercules  creating a leading specialty chemicals company 
the cost to acquire the million shares of outstanding hercules common stock at november   paid in cash and ashland common stock  was approximately billion  consisting of cash consideration of billion and stock consideration  valued as of the original announcement date  of billion 
ashland common stock issued as part of the merger acquisition was approximately million shares 
in addition  ashland assumed debt that had a carrying value of approximately billion as of the closing date 
in conjunction with the acquisition of hercules previously described  ashland secured billion in financing from bank of america securities llc and scotia capital usa inc consisting of a million revolving credit facility  a million term loan a facility  an million term loan b facility  a million accounts receivable securitization facility  and a million bridge loan 
the total debt drawn upon the closing of the completed merger was billion resulting in ongoing ashland total debt of approximately billion  which included amounts used to fund the extinguishment of certain debt instruments that hercules held as of the closing date 
as a result of the financing and subsequent debt issued to complete this merger  standard poor s downgraded ashland s corporate credit rating to bb and moody s investor services downgraded ashland s corporate credit rating to ba in addition  ashland is now subject to cash and other restrictions from various debt covenants 
these covenants include certain affirmative covenants such as various internal certifications  maintenance of property and applicable insurance coverage as well as negative covenants that include financial covenant restrictions associated with leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and total net worth 
at september   working capital excluding debt due within one year amounted to  million  compared to  million at the end of ashland s working capital is affected by its use of the lifo method of inventory valuation that valued inventories below their replacement costs by million at september  and million at september  liquid assets cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities and accounts receivable amounted to of current liabilities at september   compared to at september  the decrease in both working capital and liquid assets is partially attributable to auction rate securities classified as noncurrent assets in the current year as opposed to being classified as current assets in the prior year 
at september   ashland held at par value million of student loan auction rate securities  which are variable rate debt securities and have a long term maturity with the interest rates being reset through a dutch auction process typically held every or days  for which there was not an active market 
auction rate securities have historically traded at par value and are callable at par value at the option of the issuer 
at september   all the student loan instruments held by ashland were aaa rated and collateralized by student loans which have guarantees by the us government under the federal family education loan program 
until february  the auction rate securities market was highly liquid 
starting mid february  a substantial number of auctions became largely illiquid as there was not enough demand to sell all of the securities that holders desired to sell at auction 
because the auction rate securities market has failed to achieve equilibrium since mid february  ashland determined that there is insufficient observable auction rate securities market information available to determine the fair value of the student loan securities 
as a result  ashland developed various internal valuation models to estimate the fair value of these auction rate securities based on discounted cash flow models and relevant observable market prices 
assumptions used in estimating fair value include credit quality  liquidity  estimates on the probability of each valuation model  and the impact due to extended periods of maximum auction rates 
based on these various internal valuation models  ashland has recorded a temporary impairment of million related to the student loan securities as of september  any basis point change in the discount rate or three month adjustment in the duration assumptions would impact the internal valuation model by approximately million 
ashland believes this adjustment in valuation is necessary to account for the current limited liquidity of these instruments and should be temporary 
ashland believes these securities ultimately will be liquidated primarily due to the quality of the collateral securing most of the instruments as well as based on recent actions being taken to correct the current failed auctions in this marketplace 
however  the period of time it could take to ultimately realize the securities par value is currently not determinable and may be longer than twelve months 
as a result  ashland has classified these instruments as long term assets at september  in ashland s consolidated balance sheet 
as of september  ashland has the intent and ability to hold the auction rate securities for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery of the principal amounts invested 
m capital resources on september  ashland s board of directors authorized the distribution of a substantial portion of the proceeds of the sale of apac to the ashland common stock shareholders as a one time special dividend 
each shareholder of record as of october   received per share  for a total of million 
this amount was accrued as dividends payable in the consolidated balance sheet at september  and was subsequently paid during substantially all of the remaining proceeds were directed to be used to repurchase ashland common stock in accordance with the terms authorized by ashland s board of directors 
see note l of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of ashland s share repurchase programs 
ashland did not repurchase any shares during  but did repurchase million shares for million during and million shares for million during since july through september   ashland has repurchased a total of million shares at a cost of million 
these repurchases represent approximately of the shares outstanding on june  the stock repurchase actions were consistent with certain representations of intent made to the internal revenue service with respect to the transfer of map 
at september   million common shares are reserved for issuance under stock incentive and deferred compensation plans 
as part of the completed merger to acquire all of the outstanding shares of hercules in november  ashland issued approximately million shares 
see note q of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding the completed merger 
property additions excluding the property additions of the discontinued operations of apac averaged million during the last three years and are summarized in the information by industry segment on page f for the past three years  performance materials accounted for of ashland s capital expenditures  while valvoline accounted for  distribution accounted for and water technologies accounted for 
capital used for acquisitions amounted to million during the last three years  of which million was invested in performance materials  million in water technologies and million in valvoline 
a summary of the capital employed in ashland s current operations as of the end of the last three years follows 
in millions capital employed performance materials distribution valvoline water technologies during  ashland reduced its total debt by million to million and stockholders equity increased by million to  million 
the increases in stockholders equity resulted from million of net income  million from issuance of common shares under stock incentive and other plans and million of translation gains associated with foreign operations 
these increases were offset by a million decrease attributable to an increase in the pension and other postretirement liability  a million decrease associated with unrealized losses on investment securities and regular cash dividends of million 
debt as a percent of capital employed was at september  compared to at september  during  ashland expects total capital expenditures  including those related to the hercules businesses  to be below the actual capital expenditures of million in capital expenditures during included several significant nonrecurring expenditures  including million for growth initiatives specifically related to china  which included construction of an administration and technology office building  and million for costs associated with the implementation of the erp system 
in  ashland initiated a multi year erp project that is expected to increase efficiency and effectiveness in supply chain  financial  and environmental  health and safety processes 
the implementation of the erp system began in october in canada  continued during fiscal for all us operations  and was successfully launched in our europe  middle east  africa  china and singapore operations during as of september   ashland had more than of global revenue converted and functioning on this one erp system  which is a significant milestone 
the total cost of the project through fiscal is million  of which million has been capitalized 
on november   the board of directors of ashland declared a quarterly cash dividend of cents per share  payable december   to shareholders of record at the close of business on december  this is reduced from the previous quarterly dividend of cents per share 
in total  the reduction is expected to decrease ashland s annual cash outflow for dividends by approximately million

off balance sheet arrangements as part of its normal course of business  ashland is a party to various financial guarantees and other commitments 
these arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk that are not included in the consolidated balance sheets 
the possibility that ashland would have to make actual cash expenditures in connection with these obligations is largely dependent on the performance of the guaranteed party  or the occurrence of future events that ashland is unable to predict 
ashland has reserved the approximate fair value of these guarantees in accordance with the provisions of interpretation no 
fin guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of ashland s consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
significant items that are subject to such estimates and assumptions include long lived assets  employee benefit obligations  income taxes  reserves and associated receivables for asbestos litigation and environmental remediation 
although management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has reviewed the estimates affecting these items with the audit committee of ashland s board of directors 
long lived assets the cost of plant and equipment is depreciated principally by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
useful lives are based on historical experience and are adjusted when changes in planned use  technological advances or other factors show that a different life would be more appropriate 
such costs are periodically reviewed for recoverability when impairment indicators are present 
such indicators include  among other factors  operating losses  unused capacity  market value declines and technological obsolescence 
recorded values of property  plant and equipment that are not expected to be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows are written down to current fair value  m which generally is determined from estimated discounted future net cash flows assets held for use or net realizable value assets held for sale 
asset impairment charges were million in  million in and million in goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are subject to an annual impairment test as of july and whenever events or circumstances make it more likely than not that an impairment may have occurred 
such tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of ashland s reporting units  which are operating segments or business units within these operating segments 
because market prices of ashland s reporting units are not readily available  management makes various estimates and assumptions in determining the estimated fair values of those units 
fair values are based principally on ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization multiples of peer group companies for each of these reporting units and  as deemed necessary  a discounted cash flow model 
ashland did not recognize any goodwill impairment during  and the most recent annual impairment tests indicated that the fair values of each of ashland s reporting units with significant goodwill were in excess of their carrying values  with consolidated fair values exceeding carrying values by approximately 
despite that excess  however  impairment charges could still be required if a divestiture decision or other significant economic event were made or occurred with respect to a particular business included in one of the reporting units 
subsequent to this annual impairment test  no indications of an impairment were identified 
employee benefit obligations ashland and its subsidiaries sponsor contributory and noncontributory qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all employees in the united states and in a number of other countries 
benefits under these plans generally are based on employees years of service and compensation during the years immediately preceding their retirement 
in addition  the companies also sponsor unfunded postretirement benefit plans  which provide health care and life insurance benefits for eligible employees who retire or are disabled 
retiree contributions to ashland s health care plans are adjusted periodically  and the plans contain other cost sharing features  such as deductibles and coinsurance 
life insurance plans generally are noncontributory 
certain assumptions are used to measure the plan obligations of company sponsored defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans 
ashland s pension and other postretirement obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions including the discount rate at which obligations can be effectively settled  the anticipated rate of compensation increase  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and certain employee related factors  such as turnover  retirement age and mortality 
because ashland s retiree health care plans contain various caps that limit ashland s contributions and because medical inflation is expected to continue at a rate in excess of these caps  the health care cost trend rate has no material impact on ashland s postretirement health care benefit costs 
ashland developed the discount rate used to determine the present value of its obligations under the us pension and postretirement health and life plans by matching the stream of benefit payments from the plans to the mercer pension discount yield curve spot rates 
ashland uses this approach to reflect the specific cash flows of these plans for determining the discount rate 
the discount rate determined as of september  was for the us pension plans and for the postretirement health and life plans 
non us pension plans followed a similar process based on financial markets in those countries where ashland provides a defined benefit pension plan 
the weighted average discount rate for ashland s us and us pension plans combined was as of september  at september   the discount rate for us pension and postretirement health and life plans was established by matching the benefit payment streams from the plans to the citigroup pension discount curve spot rates 
the mercer pension discount yield curve was elected in while both models use the same ashland specific benefit cash flows  the mercer model is based on actual corporate rates 
management determined that during a period of such extreme market volatility  a model that closely reflects corporate rates would be more appropriate 
ashland s expense under both us and us pension plans is determined using the discount rate as of the beginning of the fiscal year  which amounted to a weighted average rate of for  for and for the rates used for the postretirement health and life plans were for  for and for the expense for the pension plans will be based on a weighted average discount rate of  while will be used for the postretirement health and life plans 
the weighted average rate of compensation increase assumptions were for  for and for the compensation increase assumptions for the us plans were for  for and for the rate of the compensation increase assumption for the us plans will remain at in determining ashland s pension costs for the weighted average long term expected rate of return on assets was assumed to be in  in and in the long term expected rate of return on assets for the us plans was assumed to be in  in and in for  the us pension plan assets generated an actual loss of  compared to m an actual return of in and in however  the expected return on plan assets is designed to be a long term assumption  and actual returns will be subject to considerable year to year variances 
ashland has generated compounded annual investment returns of and on its us pension plan assets over the last five year and ten year periods 
in  of the pension portfolio was shifted from equity investments to alternative assets  prompting an increase in the expected return on us plan assets to in determining ashland s pension costs for ashland estimates total fiscal pension costs to be approximately million 
as of september   ashland revised certain demographic assumptions used to determine its pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
to comply with provisions of the pension protection act of  the mortality assumption was changed to the rp combined mortality table with mortality improvement projected forward from the base year of by seven years for annuitants and years for nonannuitants using scale aa 
the previous mortality assumption was the rp combined mortality table for males and females healthy lives projected to using scale aa 
the turnover and retirement rates are based upon actual experience and were not revised 
shown below are the estimated increases in pension and postretirement expense that would have resulted from a one percentage point change in each of the assumptions for each of the last three years 
in millions increase in pension costs from decrease in the discount rate increase in the salary adjustment rate decrease in the expected return on plan assets increase in other postretirement costs from decrease in the discount rate income taxes ashland is subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining ashland s provision for income taxes and the related assets and liabilities 
income taxes are accounted for under fasb statement no 
fas  accounting for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes includes income taxes paid  currently payable or receivable  and those deferred 
under fas  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities  and are measured using enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets are also recognized for the estimated future effects of tax loss carryforwards 
the effect on deferred taxes of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period in which the enactment date changes 
valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized

asbestos related litigation ashland is subject to liabilities from claims alleging personal injury caused by exposure to asbestos 
such claims result primarily from indemnification obligations undertaken in in connection with the sale of riley  a former subsidiary 
although riley was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos  its industrial boilers contained some asbestos containing components provided by other companies 
ashland retained hr a to assist in developing and annually updating independent reserve estimates for future asbestos claims and related costs given various assumptions 
the methodology used by hr a to project future asbestos costs is based largely on ashland s recent experience  including claim filing and settlement rates  disease mix  enacted legislation  open claims  and litigation defense and claim settlement costs 
ashland s claim experience is compared to the results of previously conducted epidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases 
those studies were undertaken in connection with national analyses of the population expected to have been exposed to m asbestos 
using that information  hr a estimates a range of the number of future claims that may be filed  as well as the related costs that may be incurred in resolving those claims 
from the range of estimates  ashland records the amount it believes to be the best estimate of future payments for litigation defense and claim settlement costs 
during the most recent update of this estimate completed during  it was determined that the reserve for asbestos claims should be increased by million 
this increase in the reserve was based on the results of a non inflated  non discounted year model developed with the assistance of hr a 
this increase resulted in total reserves for asbestos claims of million at september   compared to million at september  projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict 
in addition to the significant uncertainties surrounding the number of claims that might be received  other variables include the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the impact of bankruptcies of other companies that are co defendants in claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards 
furthermore  any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
in light of these inherent uncertainties  ashland believes its asbestos reserve represents the best estimate within a range of possible outcomes 
as a part of the process to develop ashland s estimates of future asbestos costs  a range of long term cost models is developed 
these models are based on national studies that predict the number of people likely to develop asbestos related diseases and are heavily influenced by assumptions regarding long term inflation rates for indemnity payments and legal defense costs  as well as other variables mentioned previously 
ashland has estimated that it is reasonably possible that total future litigation defense and claim settlement costs on an inflated and undiscounted basis could range as high as approximately billion  depending on the combination of assumptions selected in the various models 
if actual experience is worse than projected relative to the number of claims filed  the severity of alleged disease associated with those claims or costs incurred to resolve those claims  ashland may need to increase further the estimates of the costs associated with asbestos claims and these increases could potentially be material over time 
ashland has insurance coverage for most of the litigation defense and claim settlement costs incurred in connection with its asbestos claims  and coverage in place agreements exist with the insurance companies that provide most of the coverage currently being accessed 
as a result  increases in the asbestos reserve have been largely offset by probable insurance recoveries 
the amounts not recoverable generally are due from insurers that are insolvent  rather than as a result of uninsured claims or the exhaustion of ashland s insurance coverage 
ashland has estimated the value of probable insurance recoveries associated with its asbestos reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage  including an assumption that all solvent insurance carriers remain solvent 
approximately of the estimated receivables from insurance companies are expected to be due from domestic insurers  of which have a credit rating of b or higher by a 
m 
best as of september  the remainder of the insurance receivable is due from london insurance companies  which generally have lower credit quality ratings  and from underwriters at lloyd s  which is reinsured by equitas limited 
ashland discounts a substantial portion of this piece of the receivable based upon the projected timing of the receipt of cash from those insurers 
during a significant amount of equitas reinsurance of liabilities became reinsured by national indemnity corporation  a member of the berkshire hathaway group of insurance companies with a current a 
m 
best rating of a 
as a result ashland reassessed its assumptions for the receivable recorded from equitas  and due to the improved credit quality of this portion of the receivable  ashland increased its recorded receivable by million during at september   ashland s receivable for recoveries of litigation defense and claim settlement costs from insurers amounted to million  of which million relate to costs previously paid 
receivables from insurers amounted to million at september  during  the model used for purposes of valuing the asbestos reserve described above  and its impact on the valuation of future recoveries from insurers was updated  which caused an additional million increase in the receivable for probable insurance recoveries 
environmental remediation ashland is subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that require environmental assessment or remediation efforts collectively environmental remediation at multiple locations 
at september   such locations included waste treatment or disposal sites where ashland has been identified as a potentially responsible party under superfund or similar state laws  current and former operating facilities including certain operating facilities conveyed to map and about  service station properties  of which are being actively remediated 
ashland s reserves for environmental remediation amounted to million at september   compared to million at september   of which million at september  and million at september  were classified m in noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
the total reserves for environmental remediation reflect ashland s estimates of the most likely costs that will be incurred over an extended period to remediate identified conditions for which the costs are reasonably estimable  without regard to any third party recoveries 
engineering studies  probability techniques  historical experience and other factors are used to identify and evaluate remediation alternatives and their related costs in determining the estimated reserves for environmental remediation 
ashland regularly adjusts its reserves as environmental remediation continues 
ashland has estimated the value of its probable insurance recoveries associated with its environmental reserve based on management s interpretations and estimates surrounding the available or applicable insurance coverage 
at september  and ashland s recorded receivable for these probable insurance recoveries was million and million  respectively 
environmental remediation expense is included within the selling  general and administrative expense caption of the statements of consolidated income and on an aggregate basis amounted to million in  million in and million in environmental remediation expense  net of receivable activity  was million in  million in and million in the decrease in net environmental remediation expense during fiscal and compared to fiscal is principally attributable to favorable remediation developments for a portion of our sites and enhancements made to our environmental remediation estimation process 
in addition  in fiscal  engineering estimates for future remediation costs related to former ashland properties transferred to marathon ashland petroleum llc map exceeded a contractual ceiling established with marathon oil corporation under the terms of the map transaction 
as part of the map transaction  ashland agreed to pay the first million of environmental remediation costs incurred on or after january  related to former ashland petroleum properties that were contributed to map upon the formation of the joint venture in engineering estimates for future remediation costs related to former ashland properties transferred to map exceeded the million ceiling during fiscal accordingly  after that point  no additional expense was required for these sites 
environmental remediation reserves are subject to numerous inherent uncertainties that affect ashland s ability to estimate its share of the costs 
such uncertainties involve the nature and extent of contamination at each site  the extent of required cleanup efforts under existing environmental regulations  widely varying costs of alternate cleanup methods  changes in environmental regulations  the potential effect of continuing improvements in remediation technology  and the number and financial strength of other potentially responsible parties at multiparty sites 
although it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate costs of environmental remediation  ashland currently estimates that the upper end of the reasonably possible range of future costs for identified sites could be as high as approximately million 
no individual remediation location is material to ashland  as its largest reserve for any site does not exceed of the remediation reserve 
outlook during the past several years ashland has redesigned its core operations to better position each business for future growth while combining to form a dynamic company that is a leading global provider of specialty chemicals 
in recent years ashland has divested several key non core businesses and reinvested those proceeds in both organic and acquisitive growth opportunities  culminating in ashland s recent purchase in november of hercules 
this recent acquisition propels ashland to a global leadership position with expanded capabilities and promising growth potential in specialty resins  specialty additives and functional ingredients and paper and water technologies 
performance materials will continue to be challenged by the difficult conditions in the north american construction and transportation markets and the recent downturn in the european market 
as a result of these weakening market conditions in many of performance materials key north american markets  reductions have occurred in operational headcount at five manufacturing facilities 
in addition  the composite polymers and specialty polymers and adhesives business units were consolidated during the last quarter of fiscal  combining many sales  marketing  technical and administrative roles 
substantial improvements in performance materials cost structure as a result of these personnel decreases  as well as the reductions in the hours of operations and headcount at certain manufacturing facilities  should curtail the impact of adverse economic conditions 
ashland expects that price increases implemented during the last quarter of fiscal  combined with softness in the crude oil market  should provide some improvement to the gross profit percentage of the business  as long as volume reductions are not significant 
distribution s future performance will continue to be affected by volatile raw material costs and weakness in north american industrial output  particularly from the core markets of building and construction  coatings  automotive and marine 
the volume in this business is predominantly contingent on these us industrial production sectors and ashland remains concerned about the level of business activity of our customers due to the current global economic environment 
while any one customer would not have a significant impact on this business  the widespread nature of the credit crisis will likely be reflected in reduced overall demand 
however  the continued focus on pricing and margins should assist in partially mitigating the effects of these economic trends 
m despite persistent volume declines in the overall lubricant market and unprecedented increases in raw material costs during  valvoline nearly equaled its record operating income performance of while volume challenges will likely continue during  this business has demonstrated the ability to outperform the market as valvoline instant oil change and other international businesses are well positioned for continued earnings growth 
valvoline s price increases implemented during the last quarter of fiscal fully offset the record raw material cost increases received over the summer months  where the crude oil market climbed to over a barrel 
these price increases combined with no significant prospects for higher base oil pricing  should enable gross profit to improve on a unit basis from depressed levels in the last half of given the recent decline in the crude oil market  ashland does expect downward pressure on raw material costs during in a highly competitive lubricant market 
water technologies implemented a number of cost reductions during in sales  marketing  technical  administrative and plant staffing  with additional reductions targeted for  to harmonize the cost structure in support of this business 
these reductions should have a positive impact on near term results 
in addition  during the first quarter of fiscal  to of full service and municipal contracts come up for annual renewal and renegotiation 
these new pricing contracts  along with recent price increases and a softer raw material market  should allow for gross profit percentage expansion from significantly reduced levels in the last quarter of fiscal  particularly starting in the second quarter of fiscal  after many contract renewals are negotiated 
during ashland implemented several operational redesigns  primarily within our performance materials and water technologies businesses 
ashland is significantly ahead of plan in achieving initial targeted run rate annualized cost savings of million by year end fiscal  already achieving a run rate savings of million through the end of fiscal through these operational redesign initiatives in the historical businesses  ashland expects to achieve in total million of cost structure efficiencies by the end of fiscal the hercules integration process is progressing 
identified synergy saving opportunities of approximately million are currently being implemented throughout both ashland s previously existing organization and hercules structure 
ashland expects to generate run rate synergies of approximately million by the first anniversary of the closing date of the acquisition 
as part of the financing agreement for this acquisition  ashland will be subjected to cash restrictions from certain debt covenants  including leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios  which could restrict the company s financial and operational flexibility 
with the commitment of these new employees and the addition of hercules paper technologies and ventures and aqualon business operations  ashland is poised for continued growth as a leader in the specialty chemical industry 
effects of inflation and changing prices ashland s financial statements are prepared on the historical cost method of accounting and  as a result  do not reflect changes in the purchasing power of the us dollar 
although annual inflation rates have been low in recent years  ashland s results are still affected by the cumulative inflationary trend from prior years 
certain of the industries in which ashland operates are capital intensive  and replacement costs for its plant and equipment generally would exceed their historical costs 
accordingly  depreciation and amortization expense would be greater if it were based on current replacement costs 
however  because replacement facilities would reflect technological improvements and changes in business strategies  such facilities would be expected to be more productive than existing facilities  mitigating at least part of the increased expense 
ashland uses the lifo method to value a substantial portion of its inventories to provide a better matching of revenues with current costs 
however  lifo values such inventories below their replacement costs 
monetary assets such as cash  cash equivalents and accounts receivable lose purchasing power as a result of inflation  while monetary liabilities such as accounts payable and indebtedness result in a gain  because they can be settled with dollars of diminished purchasing power 
ashland s monetary assets continues to currently exceed its monetary liabilities  leaving it more exposed to the effects of future inflation than in the past  when that relationship was reversed 
however  given the recent consistent stability of inflation in the us in the past several years as well as forward economic outlooks  current inflationary pressures seem moderate 
m forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis md a contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of the statements include those made with respect to ashland s operating performance and ashland s acquisition of hercules incorporated 
these expectations are based upon a number of assumptions  including those mentioned within the md a 
performance estimates are also based upon internal forecasts and analyses of current and future market conditions and trends  management plans and strategies  operating efficiencies and economic conditions  such as prices  supply and demand  cost of raw materials  weather and legal proceedings and claims including environmental and asbestos matters 
these risks and uncertainties may cause actual operating results to differ materially from those stated  projected or implied 
such risks and uncertainties with respect to ashland s acquisition of hercules include the possibility that the benefits anticipated from the hercules transaction will not be fully realized  the substantial indebtedness ashland has incurred to finance the acquisition may impair ashland s financial condition  the restrictive covenants under the debt instruments may hinder the successful operation of ashland s business  future cash flow may be insufficient to repay the debt  and other risks that are described in filings made by ashland with the securities and exchange commission sec 
although ashland believes its expectations are based on reasonable assumptions  it cannot assure the expectations reflected herein will be achieved 
this forward looking information may prove to be inaccurate and actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated if one or more of the underlying assumptions or expectations proves to be inaccurate or is unrealized or if other unexpected conditions or events occur 
other factors  uncertainties and risks affecting ashland are contained in risks and uncertainties in note a to the notes to consolidated financial statements and in item a of this annual report on form k 
ashland undertakes no obligation to subsequently update or revise the forward looking statements made in this news release to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this news release 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk ashland regularly uses foreign currency derivative instruments to manage its exposure to certain transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
all derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and are measured at fair value 
changes in the fair value of all derivatives are recognized immediately in income unless the derivative qualifies as a hedge of future cash flows 
gains and losses related to a hedge are either recognized in income immediately to offset the gain or loss on the hedged item  or deferred and recorded in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet as a component of total comprehensive income and subsequently recognized in the statements of consolidated income when the hedged item affects net income 
the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of a hedge is recognized in income immediately 
ashland has typically designated a limited portion of its foreign currency derivatives as qualifying for hedge accounting treatment  but their impact on the consolidated financial statements has not been significant 
credit risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts  but exposure is limited to the replacement value of the contracts 
ashland further minimizes this credit risk through internal monitoring procedures and as of september  does not have significant credit risk on open derivative contracts 
the potential loss from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency rates on ashland s open foreign currency derivative instruments at september  would not significantly affect ashland s consolidated financial position  results of operations  cash flows or liquidity
