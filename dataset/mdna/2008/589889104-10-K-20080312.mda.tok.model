item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview during  we made substantial progress in the company s financial condition  particularly our net income which increased  compared to the same period of this improvement was largely the result of an increase in sales in of  a slight increase in gross margins  a decrease in our operating expenses as a percentage of sales by  and an improvement of in our effective income tax rate  when compared to the operating results for the same period in for the first time in three years  our net income and gross margins improved when compared to the same period in the prior year 
our focus in  on reducing costs and becoming more efficient  has started to make a difference in gross margin improvements 
we have had three consecutive quarters of gross margin improvement  which is up of sales since the first quarter of during  we improved our gross margins  principally through improved production efficiencies which resulted in lower headcount  improved product mix  the transfer of the manufacturing process of four products to mexico  and certain automation projects 
management believes future improvement in profitability will be driven by increases in gross margins 
during  we plan to transfer one additional product line to mexico  continue to implement new automation and efficiency projects and focus our sales efforts on a product mix with higher gross margins  including the introduction of several new high margin products 
for the year ended december   we reported net sales of million  up million or over the comparable period in net sales growth in was primarily driven by increased sales of our stand alone products hemostasis valves  safety scalpels  and stopcocks  procedure tray business  catheters particularly our prelude sheath product line  mini access kit catheter product line and resolve locking drainage catheter line and proguide dialysis catheters 
our gross margins as a percentage of sales were for the year ended december   compared to for year ended december  this slight increase resulted primarily from items discussed above 
net income increased for the year ended december  to million  compared to million for the prior year period 
when compared to the prior year  net income for the year ended december  was positively affected by increased sales volumes  higher gross margins  lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales  and a lower effective income tax rate

substantially all of the increase in our revenues was attributable to increased unit sales  except for a slight increase in revenues attributable to an increase in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar which increased sales by in compared to  in compared to  in compared to historically  an important part of the company s revenue growth came from increases in the number of procedures performed for patients in a given year 
starting in april of  the growth rate of coronary stents and other related procedures in the us dropped significantly  reducing the traditional growth rate of our us direct sales 
new products are another source of revenue growth

the third main source of revenue increases came from market share gains in our existing product lines 
international sales in were approximately million  or of total sales  international sales in were approximately million  or of total sales  international sales in were approximately million  or of total sales 
these increases primarily resulted from greater acceptance of our products in international markets  ongoing growth in our european direct sales  and increased sales related to improvement in the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar  as discussed above

the increase in gross margins in was principally the result of production efficiencies resulting in lower headcount  product mix improvement  the transfer of the manufacturing process of four products to mexico  and certain automation projects 
the decline in gross margins in resulted primarily from investments made during the second half of for new facilities and related costs ie utilities  maintenance  cleaning and taxes and equipment 
gross margins in were also affected by the increased cost of direct labor  increased health insurance costs  our adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r  effective january   and increased procedure tray sales in  which have lower gross margins than our overall gross margins 
the decline in gross margins in resulted primarily from the expense of constructing new facilities and purchasing equipment  increased cost of direct labor  higher overhead expenses ie utilities  maintenance  cleaning and taxes and new product launches 
the decline in gross margins for was also affected by negative margins in the new procedure tray business we acquired from medsource during the fourth quarter of the effect was a reduction of gross margins by for sales of procedure trays contributed to our total sales for our selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million  or  in over  million  or  in over  million  or  in over the significant basis points decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in as a percentage of sales  was primarily the result of operating leverage from reducing the head count while increasing sales 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative costs in as a percentage of sales  was primarily the result of a full year of costs associated with the hiring of additional sales representatives in the second half of  approximately  attributable to the adoption of sfas no 
r and an impairment charge of approximately  primarily relating to intellectual property assets acquired from sub q inc in march the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses in as a percentage of sales  compared to  was due primarily to the hiring of additional sales people and the sample expense related to new product introductions  costs associated with severance for certain executive employees in the amount of  and the buy out of a distribution agreement in the amount of  we have begun to see operating leverage basis points in our research and development r d expenses 
we have a full pipeline of new products and management believes that we have an effective level of capabilities and expertise to continue the flow of new organically developed products into the near term future 
our r d expense for increased to million  compared to million in  r d expenses for increased to million  compared to million in  and r d expenses for increased to million  compared to million for the increase in r d expenses in   and was related primarily to r d head count additions and indirect costs to support an increase in the number of new products we launched 
our r d expenses as a percentage of sales were for  for and for our effective income tax rates for   and were   and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate for over was primarily the result of the unrecognized tax benefits  related to financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which expired on our federal  state  and foreign tax returns and a non taxed gain related to corporate owned variable life insurance contracts for our deferred compensation plan 
the increase in the effective tax rate for over and the decrease in the effective tax rate for over was primarily the result of our reimbursement of costs incurred by our irish subsidiary for the development of two new products which are taxed at a lower income tax rate than our us operations 
our other income for   and was approximately   and  respectively 
the increase in other income for over was primarily the result of an increase in interest income as the result of higher average cash balances and higher interest rates 
the decrease in other income for over was primarily the result of a decrease in cash balances and therefore interest income of approximately  the decrease in other income for over was affected by a net decrease in a litigation settlement of  an increase in foreign currency transaction loss of approximately  and a decrease in interest income of approximately  our net income for   and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
net income for was positively affected by increased sales volumes  higher gross margins  lower operating expenses as a percentage of sales and a lower effective income tax rate 
net income for and was negatively affected by lower gross margins  higher research and development spending  increased selling  general and administrative expenses  and positively affected by increased sales volumes 
under sfas no 
r  which we adopted effective january   we are required to apply the expense recognition provisions of this pronouncement to equity based incentives such as stock options 
in anticipation of this pronouncement  during and we made grants of options to management and employees for a total of  and  shares of common stock  respectively  which vested immediately upon grant  rather than over five years as had been our historical practice 
additionally  subsequent to december   we accelerated the vesting on  options with an exercise price of  which was in excess of the current market price 
the immediate vesting of options and the acceleration of options which have exercise prices that are above the current market value of the common stock are anticipated to reduce our compensation expense by approximately million and million  respectively  over the next four years under the provisions of sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which we adopted effective january   we no longer amortize goodwill from business acquisitions  but review annually the impairment of goodwill  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we completed our initial testing of goodwill as of january  and determined that there was no impairment 
we have elected to perform our annual testing of goodwill impairment as of july of the applicable fiscal year 
as of july   we updated our testing of goodwill for impairment and determined that there was no impairment 
however  during the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was unlikely we would pursue the product associated with the intellectual property acquired from sub q due to our decision to pursue other priorities and opportunities that we believe are more favorable to us 
therefore  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately  in selling  general and administrative expense for  which included approximately  related to goodwill 
we had no impairments in goodwill for the years ended december  and the remaining unamortized amount of goodwill at december   was approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources capital commitments and contractual obligations the following table summarizes our capital commitments and contractual obligations as of december   including operating lease payments and office lease payments  as well as the future periods in which such payments are currently anticipated to become due payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years after years unrecognized tax positions operating leases royalty obligations total contractual cash the internal revenue service has proposed certain adjustments which will reverse the timing of certain temporary deductions 
settlement of these proposed adjustments could result in additional tax payments within the next months of which approximately million relates to fin unrecognized tax positions 
the company does not currently expect this settlement to have a material impact on financial position for as these tax adjustments relate to timing differences for income tax liabilities already recognized in our financial statements 
the company has approximately million of unrecognized tax positions that have been recognized as liabilities in accordance with fin that have not be included in the contractual obligations table due to uncertainty as to when such amounts may be settled 
additional information regarding our capital commitments and contractual obligations  including royalty payments  is contained in notes   and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  set forth in item cash flows the company s cash flow from operations reached a record million in  the increase  of million over  came mostly from a reduction in inventories and an increase in net income 
our working capital for   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
the increase in working capital for over was primarily the result of an increase in cash net of the reduction in inventory of million as we focused on improving our inventory turns 
the increase in working capital for over was primarily the result of an increase in cash flow from operations of million and a reduction in the amount of capital expenditures made  when compared to the decrease in working capital for over was primarily the result of cash being used to fund the construction of our new facilities in south jordan  utah  and galway  ireland  the purchase and remodel of our facility in chester  virginia  and the acquisitions of mctec  medsource and sub q 
we generated cash from operations for   and in the amount of million  million  and million  respectively 
on december   we entered into an unsecured loan agreement with bank of america  na the bank  whereby the bank agreed to provide us a line of credit in the amount of  prior to december   the company maintained a long term revolving credit facility the facility with zion s first national bank zion s 
the facility had a credit limit of  for years and the facility expired on june  on december   we entered into an unsecured loan agreement with zion s  whereby the bank agreed to provide us a line of credit in the amount of  we had outstanding under our lines of credit as of december  and historically  we have incurred significant expenses in connection with product development and introduction of new products 
substantial capital has also been required to finance the increase in our receivables and inventories associated with our increased sales 
during  we spent approximately million on various production equipment related to automation and new product launches  approximately million for construction costs on a new customer service and distribution facility for our european operations in the netherlands and million for improvements made to a production clean room in south jordan  utah 
during  we spent approximately million for various production equipment  approximately million on building and leasehold improvements  and approximately million on the purchase real estate in the netherlands to build a distribution facility 
during  we paid approximately million for payments to complete the construction of our new molding  technology and logistics mtl building and cafeteria expansion in south jordan  utah 
in addition  during  we spent approximately million to purchase a  square foot facility and add a clean room to our facility in chester  virginia  and approximately million to purchase seven acres of land just west of our current south jordan  utah facilities 
also during  we made significant investments were made for new equipment including approximately million in molding equipment  approximately million for an automated warehouse shipping system  and approximately million for automated production equipment 
our principal source of funding for these and other expenses has been cash generated from operations  sales of equity  and bank lines of credit 
we currently believe that our present sources of liquidity and capital are adequate for current operations and for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the sec has requested that all registrants address their most critical accounting policies 
the sec has indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the representation of the registrant s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on past experience and on various other assumptions our management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results will differ  and may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additionally  changes in accounting estimates could occur in the future from period to period 
our management has discussed the development and selection of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the following paragraphs identify our most critical accounting policies inventory obsolescence reserve 
our management reviews on a regular basis inventory quantities on hand for unmarketable and or slow moving products that may expire prior to being sold 
this review of inventory quantities for unmarketable and or slow moving products is based on estimates of forecasted product demand prior to expiration lives 
if market conditions become less favorable than those projected by our management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we believe that the amount included in our obsolescence reserve has been a historically accurate estimate of the unmarketable and or slow moving products that may expire prior to being sold 
our obsolescence reserve was approximately million as of december  allowance for doubtful accounts 
a majority of our receivables are with hospitals which  over our history  have demonstrated favorable collection rates 
therefore  we have experienced relatively minimal bad debts from hospital customers 
in limited circumstances we have written off minimal bad debts as the result of the termination of foreign distributors 
the most significant write offs over our history have come from us packers who bundle our products in surgical trays 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is based upon historical experience and a review of individual customer balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our bad debt reserve was  at december  which is consistent with historical collection experience 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  we measure share based compensation cost at the grant date based on the value of the award and recognize the cost as an expense over the term of the vesting period 
judgment is required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
income taxes 
we adopted the provisions of fin effective january  under fin  tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authorities assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
although we believe our provisions for fin unrecognized tax positions are reasonable  we can make no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which we have reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals 
the tax law is subject to varied interpretations  and we have taken positions related to certain matters where the law is subject to interpretation 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provisions and operating results in the period s in which we make such determination 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our principal market risk relates to changes in the value of the euro and great britain pound gbp relative to the value of the us dollar 
our consolidated financial statements are denominated in  and our principal currency is  the us dollar 
a portion of our revenues million  representing approximately of aggregate revenues  for the year ended december  was attributable to sales that were denominated in euros and gbps 
certain expenses are also denominated in euros and gbps  which partially offsets risks associated with fluctuations of exchanges rates between the euro and gbp on the one hand  and the us dollar on the other hand 
because of our euro and gbp denominated revenues and expenses  in a year in which our euro and gbp denominated revenues exceed our euro and gbp based expenses  the value of such euro and gbp denominated net income increases if the value of the euro and gbp increase relative to the value of the us dollar  and decreases if the value of the euro and gbp decrease relative to the value of the u 
s 
dollar 
during the year ended december   the exchange rate between the euro and gbp against the us dollar resulted in an increase of our gross revenues of approximately million and in gross profit 
at december   we had a net exposure representing the difference between euro and gbp denominated receivables and euro and gbp denominated payables of approximately  euros and  gbps  respectively 
in order to partially offset such risks  on november   we entered into day forward contract for euro and gbp 
we generally enter into similar economic transactions at various times during the year to partially offset exchange rate risks we bear throughout the year 
during the years ended december  and  we experienced a net gain of approximately  and a net loss of  respectively  from financing transactions executed during and in an effort to limit our exposure to fluctuations in the euro and gbp against the us dollar exchange rate 
we do not purchase or hold derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
another market risk relates to variable rate debt 
as of december   we had no variable rate debt 
as long as we do not have variable rate debt  our interest expense would not be affected by changes in interest rates
