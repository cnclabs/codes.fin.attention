table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
additionally  the company s senior management has discussed the critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit and finance committee 
the company s significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the discussion below addresses major judgments used in revenue recognition  accounting for allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable  reviewing the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  reviewing the carrying values of property  plant  and equipment  accounting for business combinations  accounting for taxes  accounting for pension and postretirement expenses  and accounting for termination benefits revenue recognition the company adheres to sales recognition principles described in staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  issued by the sec 
under sab no 
 sales are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
service revenue the company recognizes service revenue as services are provided 
revenue from local telephone and special access services  which are billed monthly prior to performance of service  and from prepaid wireless service  which is collected in advance  is not recognized upon billing or cash receipt but rather is deferred until the service is provided 
postpaid wireless  long distance  switched access  reciprocal compensation  and data and internet product services are billed monthly in arrears 
the company bills service revenue in regular monthly cycles  which are spread throughout the days of the month 
as the day of each billing cycle rarely coincides with the end of the company s reporting period for usage based services such as postpaid wireless  long distance  and switched access  the company must estimate service revenues earned but not yet billed 
the company bases its estimates upon historical usage and adjusts these estimates during the period in which the company can determine actual usage  typically in the following reporting period 
initial billings for wireline service connection and activation are deferred and amortized into revenue on a straight line basis over the average customer life 
the associated connection and activation costs  to the extent of the upfront fees  are also deferred and amortized on a straight line basis over the average customer life 
data center services are also recognized as service is provided 
agreements with data center customers require certain levels of service or performance 
although the occurrence is rare  if the company fails to meet these levels  customers may be able to receive service credits for their accounts 
the company records these credits against revenue when an event occurs that gives rise to such credits 
in multi year data center arrangements with increasing or decreasing monthly billings  revenues are recognized on a straight line basis 
revenue for leased data center assets is also recognized on a straight line basis over the contract term 
technology solutions professional services  including product installations  are recognized as the service is provided 
technology solutions also provides maintenance services on telephony equipment under one to four year contract terms 
this revenue is accounted for under financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin no 
 accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts  and is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the underlying customer contract 
products the company recognizes equipment revenue upon the completion of contractual obligations  such as shipment  delivery  installation  or customer acceptance 
wireless handset revenue and the related activation revenue are recognized when the products are delivered to and accepted by the customer  as this is considered to be a separate earnings process from the sale of wireless services 
wireless equipment costs are also 
table of contents recognized upon handset sale  and are in excess of the related handset and activation revenue 
the company is a reseller of it and telephony equipment and considers the criteria of emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  when recording revenue  such as title transfer  risk of product loss  and collection risk 
based on this guidance  these equipment revenues and associated costs have generally been recorded on a gross basis  rather than recording the revenues net of the associated costs 
the company benefits from vendor rebate plans  particularly rebates on hardware sold by technology solutions 
the company recognizes the rebates as an offset to costs of products sold upon sale of the related equipment to the customer 
with respect to arrangements with multiple deliverables  the company follows the guidance in eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  to determine whether more than one unit of accounting exists in an arrangement 
to the extent that the deliverables are separable into multiple units of accounting  total consideration is allocated to the individual units of accounting based on their relative fair value  determined by the price of each deliverable when it is regularly sold on a stand alone basis 
revenue is recognized for each unit of accounting as delivered or as service is performed depending on the nature of the deliverable comprising the unit of accounting 
the company is a reseller of it equipment  such as servers and routers  and often is contracted to install the it equipment that it sells 
the revenue recognition guidance in statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  is applied  which requires vendor specific objective evidence vsoe in order to recognize the it equipment separate from the installation 
the company both sells it equipment without the installation service  and provides installation services without the it equipment  and as such has vsoe that permits the separation of the it equipment from the installation services 
the company recognizes the it equipment upon completion of its contractual obligations  generally upon delivery of the it equipment to the customer  and recognizes installation service revenue upon completion of the installation 
pricing of local services is generally subject to oversight by both state and federal regulatory commissions 
such regulation also covers services  competition  and other public policy issues 
various regulatory rulings and interpretations could result in increases or decreases to revenue in future periods 
accounting for allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable the company established the allowances for uncollectible accounts using percentages of aged accounts receivable balances to reflect the historical average of credit losses as well as specific provisions for certain identifiable  potentially uncollectible balances 
the company believes its allowance for uncollectible accounts is adequate based on these methods  as the company has not had unfavorable experience with its estimation methods 
however  if one or more of the company s larger customers were to default on its accounts receivable obligations or if general economic conditions in the company s operating area deteriorated  the company could be exposed to potentially significant losses in excess of the provisions established 
substantially all of the company s outstanding accounts receivable balances are with entities located within its geographic operating areas 
regional and national telecommunications companies account for the remainder of the company s accounts receivable balances 
no one entity or collection of legally affiliated entities represents or more of the outstanding accounts receivable balances 
reviewing the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets pursuant to statement of financial account standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
with respect to goodwill  the company estimates the fair value of the respective reporting unit based on expected future cash flows generated by the reporting unit discounted at the appropriate weighted average cost of capital 
the estimated fair value of the respective reporting units was higher than its carrying values  and as such  there was no indication of impairment in indefinite lived intangible assets consist of fcc licenses for spectrum and trademarks for the wireless segment 
the company may renew the wireless licenses in a routine manner every ten years for a nominal fee  provided the company continues to meet the service and geographic coverage provisions required by the fcc 
the fair value of the licenses was determined by using the greenfield method  an income based approach 
the fair value of the trademarks were determined by using the relief from royalty method  which estimates the 
table of contents present value of royalty expense that could be avoided in the operating business as a result of owning the respective asset or technology 
the fair value of the licenses and trademarks were higher than its carrying value  and as such  there was no indication of impairment in reviewing the carrying values of property  plant and equipment the company s provision for depreciation of its telephone plant is determined on a straight line basis using the group depreciation method 
provision for depreciation of other property  other than leasehold improvements  is based on the straight line method over the estimated economic useful life 
depreciation of leasehold improvements is based on a straight line method over the lesser of the economic useful life or term of the lease  including option renewal periods if renewal of the lease is reasonably assured 
repairs and maintenance expense items are charged to expense as incurred 
the company estimates the useful lives of plant and equipment in order to determine the amount of depreciation expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
the majority of the wireline segment plant and equipment is depreciated using the group method  which develops a depreciation rate annually based on the average useful life of a specific group of assets rather than for each individual asset as would be utilized under the unit method 
the estimated life of the group changes as the composition of the group of assets and their related lives change 
such estimated life of the group is based on historical experience with similar assets  as well as taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated  or in a different form than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation expense in future periods 
likewise  if the anticipated technological or other changes occur more slowly than expected  the life of the group could be extended based on the life assigned to new assets added to the group 
this could result in a reduction of depreciation expense in future periods 
a one year decrease or increase in the useful life of these assets would increase or decrease annual depreciation expense by approximately million 
the company reviews the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets discussed above  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing impairments  the company follows the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
an impairment loss is recognized when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset or group of assets and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the asset s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
to satisfy increasing demand for existing voice minutes of use by customers as well as to provide enhanced data services such as streaming video  the company is constructing a g network and deploying it on the newly purchased aws spectrum 
due to this implementation  lives of certain gsm assets were shortened and depreciation has been accelerated based on the new useful life 
the increase in depreciation due to this acceleration was approximately million in the fourth quarter of and million in in  the company shortened the estimated remaining economic useful life of its legacy tdma wireless network to december  due to the expected migration of its tdma customer base to its gsm network 
in  the company incurred charges of million to write down the recorded value of tdma assets that were retired in and tdma assets that could no longer support their recorded value 
these charges were included in asset impairments and other charges in the consolidated statement of operations 
the company wrote down the assets to fair value  which was calculated based on the appraised amount at which the assets could be sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
also  in  the useful life of certain of the remaining tdma assets was shortened from the december  date being used  and depreciation was accelerated 
the change in depreciation expense due to the change in estimate in the second quarter decreased operating income by million 
if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than expected  it may have the effect of shortening the estimated depreciable life of other network and operating assets that the company employs 
this could have a substantial impact on the consolidated depreciation expense and net income of the company 
competition from new or more cost effective technologies could affect the company s ability to generate cash flow from its 
table of contents network based services 
this competition could ultimately result in an impairment of certain of the company s tangible or intangible assets 
this could have a substantial impact on the operating results of the consolidated company 
accounting for business combinations in accounting for business combinations  the company applies the accounting requirements of sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires the recording of net assets of acquired businesses at fair value 
in developing estimates of fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities  the company analyzes a variety of factors including market data  estimated future cash flows of the acquired operations  industry growth rates  current replacement cost for fixed assets  and market rate assumptions for contractual obligations 
such a valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to the intangible assets 
changes to the assumptions the company used to estimate fair value could impact the recorded amounts for acquired assets and liabilities  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill 
significant changes to these balances could have a material impact on the company s future reported results 
accounting for taxes income taxes the income tax provision consists of an amount for taxes currently payable and an amount for tax consequences deferred to future periods 
the company s previous tax filings are subject to normal reviews by regulatory agencies until the related statute of limitations expires 
as of december   the company had million in net deferred tax assets  which includes approximately billion in gross federal tax net operating loss carryforwards  with a deferred tax asset value of approximately million 
the tax loss carryforwards are available to the company to offset taxable income in current and future periods 
the majority of the remaining tax loss carryforwards will expire between and and are not currently limited under us tax laws 
the ultimate realization of the deferred income tax assets depends upon the company s ability to generate future taxable income during the periods in which basis differences and other deductions become deductible and prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards 
based on current income levels and anticipated future reversal of existing temporary differences  the company expects to utilize its federal net operating loss carryforwards within their expiration periods 
in addition to the federal tax net operating loss carryforwards  the company has state and local net operating loss carryforwards with a deferred tax asset value of approximately million  alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of approximately million  and deferred tax temporary differences and other tax attributes of approximately million 
a valuation allowance of million is provided at december  against certain state and local net operating losses and other deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of the company s ability to utilize the assets within the statutory expiration period 
the company determines the effective tax rate by dividing income tax expense by income before taxes as reported in its consolidated statement of operations 
for reporting periods prior to the end of the company s fiscal year  the company records income tax expense based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate 
this rate is computed using the statutory tax rate and an estimate of annual net income adjusted for an estimate of non deductible expenses 
the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  the company recognized a million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was accounted for as an increase to the january  accumulated deficit balance 
after recognizing the impact from the adoption of fin  the company had a million liability recorded for unrecognized tax benefits as of january  at december   the company has a million liability recorded for unrecognized tax benefits 
the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate is million 
the company does not currently anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly over the next year 
the company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction  and various states and local jurisdictions 
with a few exceptions  the company is no longer subject to us federal  state or local 
table of contents examinations for years before in the first quarter of  the internal revenue service commenced an examination of the company s us federal income tax returns for to the irs has completed its examination of the and tax years while is still under audit 
the company recognizes accrued penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
the company recognizes accrued interest related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense 
accrued interest and penalties are insignificant at december  and december  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the company s income taxes 
operating taxes the company incurs certain operating taxes that are reported as expenses in operating income  such as property  sales  use  and gross receipts taxes 
these taxes are not included in income tax expense because the amounts to be paid are not dependent on the level of income generated by the company 
the company also records expense against operating income for the establishment of liabilities related to certain operating tax audit exposures 
these liabilities are established based on the company s assessment of the probability of payment 
upon resolution of an audit  any remaining liability not paid is released and increases operating income 
the company recognized income of million in  million in  and million in upon resolution of operating tax audits  net of new liabilities established 
regulatory taxes the company incurs federal regulatory taxes on certain revenue producing transactions 
the company is permitted to recover certain of these taxes by billing the customer  however  collections cannot exceed the amount due to the federal regulatory agency 
these federal regulatory taxes are presented in sales and cost of services on a gross basis because  while the company is required to pay the tax  it is not required to collect the tax from customers and in fact  does not collect the tax from customers in certain instances 
the amount recorded as revenue for   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the amount expensed for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the company records all other taxes collected from customers on a net basis 
accounting for pension and postretirement expenses the pension protection act of the act was enacted on august  most of its provisions will become effective in the act significantly changes the funding requirements for single employer defined benefit pension plans 
the funding requirements will now largely be based on a plan s calculated funded status  with faster amortization of any shortfalls or surpluses 
the act directs the us treasury department to develop a new yield curve to discount pension obligations for determining the funded status of a plan when calculating the funding requirements 
as a result of a million early pension contribution in december  the company does not expect to make any contribution to its qualified pension plans in based on current assumptions  the company believes it will pay an estimated million to fund its qualified pension plans during the period to in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
sfas no 
requires the company to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status for the company s benefit plans  with changes in the funded status recognized as a separate component to shareowners equity 
sfas no 
also requires the company to measure the funded status of the benefit plans as of the year end balance sheet date no later than effective december   the company adopted sfas no 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company sponsors three noncontributory defined benefit pension plans one for eligible management employees  one for non management employees and one supplemental  nonqualified  unfunded plan for certain senior executives 
the company also provides health care and group life insurance benefits for eligible retirees 
the company s measurement date for its pension and postretirement obligations is as of december st of each year 
when changes to the plans occur during interim periods  the company reviews the changes and determines if a remeasurement is necessary 

table of contents the assumption for cost sharing with retirees is important in determining the postretirement and other benefits expense 
at the beginning of  the company accounted for its retiree medical benefit obligation as if there were no limits on the company funded portion of retiree medical costs 
in may  the company reached an agreement with the union to provide a fixed amount of medical cost reimbursement per retiree and to increase the amount annually over the life of the labor agreement 
similar benefits were provided to non bargained retirees 
effective june   the company remeasured its postretirement obligations for the changes to the expected future retiree medical costs  including assumptions regarding cost sharing by retirees 
in august  the company announced further changes to its pension and postretirement plans that reduce medical benefit payments by fixing the annual company contribution for each eligible retiree and that reduce life insurance benefits paid from these plans 
based on these changes  the company determined that a remeasurement of its pension and postretirement obligations was necessary 
the company remeasured its pension and postretirement obligations in august using revised assumptions  including modified benefit payment assumptions reflecting the changes and a discount rate of 
these changes reduce the company s pension and postretirement obligations by approximately million  reduce deferred tax assets for the related tax effect by million  and increase equity by million 
additionally  the remeasurement caused a reduction to the company s pension and postretirement benefit costs by approximately million since august the key assumptions used to account for the plans are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the actuarial assumptions attempt to anticipate future events and are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to these plans 
the most significant of these numerous assumptions  which are reviewed annually  include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates 
discount rate a discount rate is used to measure the present value of the benefit obligations 
the company determines the discount rate for each plan individually 
in determining the selection of a discount rate  the company estimates the timing and expected future benefit payments  and applies a yield curve developed to reflect yields available on high quality bonds 
based on the analysis  the discount rate was set at   and for all of the plans as of december   and  respectively 
expected rate of return the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  developed using the building block approach  is based on the following the participant s benefit horizons  the mix of investments held directly by the plans  which is generally equities and bonds  and the current view of expected future returns  which is influenced by historical averages 
the required use of an expected versus actual long term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension expense or income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year 
over time  however  the expected long term returns are designed to approximate the actual long term returns 
to the extent the company changed its estimate of the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  there would be an impact on pension expense or income and the associated net liability or asset 
the company uses an assumed long term rate of return of for the company s pension and postretirement trusts 
actual asset returns for the pension trusts  which represent over of invested assets  were approximately in  in and in in its pension calculations  the company utilizes the market related value of plan assets  which is a calculated asset value that recognizes changes in asset fair values in a systematic and rational manner 
differences between actual and expected returns are recognized in the market related value of plan assets over five years 
health care cost trend the company s health care cost trend rate is developed on historical cost data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the health care cost trend rate used to measure the postretirement health benefit obligation at december  was and is assumed to decrease gradually to by the year 
table of contents the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to the changing market and economic conditions and other changes 
revisions to and variations from these estimates would impact assets  liabilities  equity  costs of services and products  and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the following table represents the sensitivity of changes in certain assumptions related to the company s pension and postretirement plans dollars in millions point change pension benefits postretirement and other benefits increase decrease in obligation increase decrease in expense increase decrease in obligation increase decrease in expense discount rate expected return on assets n a n a health care cost trend rate n a n a at december   the company had unrecognized actuarial net losses of million for the pension plans and million for the postretirement and other benefit plans 
the unrecognized net losses have been primarily generated by changes in previous years related to discount rates  asset return differences and actual health care costs 
because gains and losses reflect refinements in estimates as well as real changes in economic values and because some gains in one period may be offset by losses in another or vice versa  the company is not required to recognize these gains and losses in the period that they occur 
instead  if the gains and losses exceed a corridor defined in the accounting literature  the company amortizes the excess over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plan 
accounting for termination benefits the company has written severance plans covering both its management and union employees and  as such  accrues probable and estimable employee separation liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and these liabilities are based on the company s historical experience of severance  historical costs associated with severance  and management s expectation of future severance 
the company s fourth quarter restructuring plan gave rise to employee separation liabilities totaling million as of december  this represents severance costs for employees over the next five years that are primarily related to the company s need to downsize its wireline operations to conform to the decreased access lines being served by the company 
when employee terminations occur  the company considers the guidance in sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
the company offered and  by december   management employees accepted special termination benefits totaling million 
the company determined that million of these benefits have been earned through december  under sfas no 
 and this amount was therefore accrued as of december  remaining termination benefits are subject to future service requirements as determined by the company and will be amortized to expense over the future service period 
the company estimates these amounts to be approximately million in and million in the company also considers whether employee terminations give rise to a pension and postretirement curtailment charge under sfas no 
the company s policy is that terminations in a calendar year involving or more of the plan service years result in a curtailment of the pension or postretirement plan 
terminations from the fourth quarter restructuring plan resulted in curtailments for the management pension and postretirement plans totaling a charge of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the company s restructuring plans 
regulatory matters and competitive trends federal the telecommunications act of was enacted with the goal of establishing a pro competitive  deregulatory framework to promote competition and investment in advanced telecommunications facilities and services to all americans 
since  federal regulators have considered a multitude of proceedings ostensibly aimed at fulfilling the goals of the act and this process is continuing through numerous proceedings currently before the fcc and the federal courts 
although the act called for a 
table of contents deregulatory framework  the fcc s approach has been to maintain significant regulatory restraints on the traditional incumbent local exchange carriers while opening up opportunities for new competitive entrants and services with minimal regulation such as cable modem broadband providers and voip providers 
while cincinnati bell has expanded beyond its incumbent local exchange operations by offering wireless  long distance  broadband service  internet access and out of territory competitive local exchange services  the majority of its revenue is still derived from its traditional local exchange services 
the financial impact of the various federal proceedings will depend on many factors including the extent of competition in our market and the timing and outcome of the fcc s decisions and any appeals from those decisions 
intercarrier compensation current rules specify different means of compensating carriers for the use of their networks depending on the type of traffic and technology used by the carriers 
the fcc has opened a proceeding to consider various plans that have been proposed for revising the disparate intercarrier compensation system into a unified regime that treats all traffic in a uniform manner 
the outcome of this proceeding could have significant impacts on all carriers and will probably be phased in over a five to ten year period 
this proceeding impacts the switched access and end user components of cbt s revenue 
reciprocal compensation although the topic of reciprocal compensation will ultimately be addressed within the broader intercarrier compensation proceeding mentioned above  the fcc adopted an order which in the short term directly impacted the rules for the termination of isp bound dial up traffic 
the previous rules capped the total number of minutes that could be compensated growth cap and limited compensation to markets in which the carriers previously exchanged traffic new markets rule 
the fcc s new order eliminated the growth cap and the new markets rule 
this decision could increase the amount that cbt must pay to clecs with which it exchanges such traffic 
voip in the fcc declared that voip services are interstate services and purported to preempt state regulation 
since then  the fcc has considered several petitions asking it to rule on whether and under what circumstances voice services utilizing internet protocol ip are subject to access charges 
it has ruled that peer to peer internet voice services that do not use the public switched telephone network pstn are not subject to access charges 
separately  it has ruled that services that originate and terminate on the pstn but employ ip in the middle are subject to access charges 
the fcc is still considering other voip petitions  including one that seeks to exempt from access charges calls that originate using voip  but terminate on the pstn 
in addition  the fcc is considering a broader rulemaking proceeding to determine the regulatory status of ip enabled services generally 
in  the fcc expanded local number portability requirements to voip 
special access in early  the fcc opened a proceeding to review the current special access pricing rules 
under the existing rules  cbt s special access services are subject to price cap regulation with no earnings cap 
the new proceeding is examining the entire special access pricing structure  including whether or not to reinstate an earnings cap 
in  the fcc invited interested parties to update the record 
universal service the federal universal service fund is currently funded via an assessment on all telecommunications carriers interstate end user revenue 
the fcc is currently considering alternatives to this method of funding 
some of the alternatives being considered include expanding the base to include intrastate revenue or switching to an assessment based on connections and telephone numbers 
any such alteration could result in a change in the manner in which carriers recover their contributions from end users 
unbundled network elements in early  the fcc rewrote its unbundled network element rules in response to the federal court s remand of the previous rules 
the latest rules have no significant impact on cbt 
however  the elimination of 
table of contents unbundled circuit switching  and thus the une platform une p  required cbet to migrate its une p lines to alternative arrangements by march  and or to negotiate with the underlying ilec for continued provision of une p  which cbet did pursuant to a commercial agreement 
this did not have a significant adverse impact on cbet since cbet had already planned to migrate the majority of its customers to its own switching facilities 
broadband internet access in an order adopted in  the fcc provided wireline carriers the option of offering broadband internet access as a non regulated information service comparable treatment to cable modem internet access or as a regulated telecommunications service 
each option has associated costs and benefits that must be weighed in light of a carrier s current mix of existing services and new services the carrier may be contemplating offering in the future 
in  the fcc ruled that wireless broadband service is also a non regulated information service on the same regulatory footing as other broadband services  such as cable modem service and wireline dsl service 
fcc safeguards to protect customer proprietary network information cpni on april   the fcc released an order implementing new cpni rules designed to prevent pretexting to gain access to customer information 
the new rules  which became effective in december  require carriers to implement security protections limiting the manner in which certain customer information may be released and requiring notice to customers regarding certain types of changes to their account and cpni breaches 
carriers must file an annual certification with the fcc that they are compliant with the rules  including a summary of actions taken in response to customer complaints 
state because cbt generates the majority of its revenue from the operation of its public switched telephone network  its financial results follow no particular seasonal pattern 
cbt does derive a significant portion of its revenue from pricing plans that are subject to regulatory overview and approval 
in both ohio and kentucky  cbt operates under alternative regulation plans in which cbt is subject to restrictions on its ability to increase the price of basic local service and related services 
in return  cbt is not subject to an earnings cap or recapture in ohio  as it would if regulated under a traditional regulatory plan based upon a targeted rate of return 
cbt has operated under alternative regulation plans since during which price increases and enhanced flexibility for a limited number of services have partially offset the effect of fixed pricing for basic local service and reduced pricing for other  primarily wholesale services 
in june  cbt adopted a new alternative regulation plan in ohio  which  although similar to its previous plan  gives cbt the option to remain in the alternative regulation plan indefinitely 
statutory changes enacted by the ohio general assembly in august gave the public utilities commission of ohio the puco the authority to provide ilecs with pricing flexibility for basic local rates upon a showing that consumers have sufficient competitive alternatives house bill 
in  the company applied for and received authority from the puco to increase its rates for basic local exchange service in certain of its exchanges 
cbt implemented rate increases for basic local exchange service in the affected exchanges beginning in january the ohio consumers counsel appealed the puco s decision to the ohio supreme court  which heard arguments on december  ohio cable franchise ohio statewide video service authorization legislation was introduced on march  and signed by the governor on may  this legislation allows the company to apply for one statewide video franchise agreement rather than negotiating individual agreements with all local entities in ohio 
the act holds no build out requirements for the company  allows for no ongoing additional fees above the federally authorized and holds peg requirements to a minimum 
on october   cbet applied for statewide video service authorization which was granted in december cbet is now authorized to provide service in our self described territory with only day notification to the municipality and other providers 
the authorization can be amended to include additional territory with mere notification to the state

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk management the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings  cash flows  and the fair market value of certain assets and liabilities  while maintaining low overall borrowing costs 
because the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate fluctuations  primarily in the form of variable rate borrowings from its credit facility and changes in current rates compared to that of its fixed rate debt  the company sometimes employs derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to these fluctuations and its total interest expense over time 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes or enter into transactions for speculative purposes 
interest rate swap agreements  a particular type of derivative financial instrument  involve the exchange of fixed and variable rate interest payments between the company and its counterparties in the transactions and do not represent an actual exchange of the notional amounts between the parties 
because the notional amounts are not exchanged  the notional amounts of these agreements are not indicative of the company s exposure resulting from these derivatives 
the amounts to be exchanged between the parties are primarily the net result of the fixed and variable rate percentages to be charged on the swap s notional amount 

table of contents the company has entered into a series of fixed to variable interest rate swaps with total notional amounts of million that qualify for fair value hedge accounting 
fair value hedges offset changes in the fair value of underlying assets and liabilities 
the company s interest rate swaps at december  and are recorded at their fair value  and the carrying values of the underlying liabilities hedged the notes and notes are adjusted by the same corresponding value in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was an asset of million and a liability of million at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical change in market interest rates at december  and would change the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts by approximately million and million  respectively 
the following table sets forth the face amounts  maturity dates  and average interest rates for the fixed and variable rate debt  excluding capital leases  net unamortized premiums  and the fair value of the interest rate swaps held by the company at december  dollars in millions thereafter total fair value fixed rate debt average interest rate on fixed rate debt variable rate debt average interest rate on variable rate debt based on the average rate in effect during at december   the carrying value and fair value of fixed rate debt was  million and  million  respectively 
at december   both the carrying value and fair value of variable rate debt were million 
including the impact of the million notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements  approximately of the company s indebtedness was based on fixed interest rates at december  and  respectively
