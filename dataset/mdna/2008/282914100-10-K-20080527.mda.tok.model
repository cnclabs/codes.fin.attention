item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were founded in and completed an initial public offering of common stock in we develop and market telecommunication services for internet protocol  or ip  telephony and video applications 
we offer the packet broadband voip and video communications service  packet virtual office service  videophone equipment and services  and the packet mobiletalk service 
we shipped our first voip product in  launched our packet service in november  the packet virtual office business service offering in march and the packet mobiletalk service in november as of march   we had more than  packet residential and videophone lines and more than  business customers in service 
since fiscal  substantially all of our revenues have been generated from the sale  license and provision of voip products  services and technology 
prior to fiscal  our focus was on our voip semiconductor business 
critical accounting policies estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified the policies below as some of the more critical to our business and the understanding of our results of operations 
these policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
although we believe our judgments and estimates are appropriate  actual future results may differ from our estimates 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and equity and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to bad debts  valuation of inventories  and litigation and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets  liabilities and equity that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
additional information regarding risk factors that may impact our estimates is included above under item a  risk factors 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
historically  we recognized new subscriber revenue from our packet service offerings upon the expiration of the applicable acceptance period 
under the terms of our typical subscription agreement  new customers can terminate their service within days of order placement and receive a full refund of fees previously paid 
during the first few years of our packet service  we lacked sufficient history to apply a return rate and reserve against new order revenue and  accordingly  deferred new subscriber revenue until the day acceptance period had expired 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we evaluated two years of historical data related to the termination of service during the day acceptance period and by june  had determined that we had sufficient history of subscriber conduct to make reasonable estimates of cancellations within the day trial period 
therefore  in the first quarter of fiscal  we began recognizing new subscriber revenue in the month in which the new order was shipped  net of an allowance for expected cancellations 
as a result of this change in accounting policy  we accelerated the recognition of an additional  of new order service revenue   of new order product revenue and  of new order cost of product for the first quarter of fiscal emerging issues task force eitf consensus no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables requires that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables in the arrangement meet specific criteria 
in addition  arrangement consideration must be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  with certain limitations 
the provisioning of the packet service with the accompanying desktop terminal or videophone adapter constitutes a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with the guidance of eitf no 
 we allocate packet revenues  including activation fees  among the desktop terminal adapter  virtual office phone  or videophone and subscriber services 
subsequent to the subscriber s initial purchase of the services  revenues allocated to the desktop terminal adapter  virtual office phone or videophone are recognized as product revenues during the period of the sale less the allowance for estimated returns during the day trial period 
all other revenues are recognized when the related services are provided 
the cost of the products sold is recognized contemporaneously with the recognition of revenue 
at the time of each revenue transaction  we assess whether the revenue amount is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we generally do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we defer recognition of revenue on product sales to retailers where the right of return exists until products are resold to the end user and the trial period has expired 
during fiscal  and  revenues from software licensing and related arrangements were limited 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  undelivered maintenance and support  we have allocated revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
this means that we defer revenue from the arranged fee that is equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations for our technology licenses are based upon separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
we base the fair value of services  such as training or consulting  on separate sales of these services to other customers 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates  and we generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
under our revenue recognition accounting principles  if a software license arrangement includes acceptance criteria  we do not recognize revenue until we can demonstrate objectively that the software or service can meet the acceptance criteria or that the customer has signed formal acceptance documentation 
if a software license arrangement obligates us to deliver unspecified future products  we recognize revenue on a subscription basis  ratably over the term of the contract 
for all sales  except those completed via the internet  we use either a binding purchase order or other signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement  and recognize revenue upon settlement of the transaction  if there are no customer acceptance conditions 
we do not settle credit card transactions until equipment related to the transaction  if any  is shipped to a customer 
our ability to enter into revenue generating transactions and recognize revenue in the future is subject to a number of business and economic risks discussed above under item a  risk factors 
collectability of accounts receivable we must make estimates of the collectability of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  including historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of march   the accounts receivable balance was million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  including a reserve for disputed credits  and an estimated returns reserve of  if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  our actual losses may exceed our estimates  and additional allowances would be required 
valuation of inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions and replacement costs 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warrant liability we account for our warrants in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in a company s own stock eitf which requires warrants to be classified as permanent equity  temporary equity or as assets or liabilities 
in general  warrants that either require net cash settlement or are presumed to require net cash settlement are recorded as assets and liabilities at fair value and warrants that require settlement in shares are recorded as equity instruments 
certain of our warrants require settlement in shares and are accounted for as permanent equity 
we also have two investor warrants that are classified as liabilities because they include a provision that specifies that we must deliver freely tradable shares upon exercise by the warrant holder 
because there are circumstances  irrespective of likelihood  which may not be within our control that could prevent delivery of registered shares  eitf requires the warrants be recorded as a liability at fair value  with subsequent changes in fair value recorded as income loss in change in fair value of warrant liability 
the fair value of the warrant is determined using a black scholes option pricing model  and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including our stock price  expected stock price volatility and contractual term 
the amount we record as a liability under eitf is not  nor do we intend for it to be an admission or stipulation of the amount that we would owe or be obligated to pay the warrant holder in the event of an actual breach by us of the warrant terms 
in fact  we have made no determination of the amount of liability  if any  that we would owe to the warrant holder in the event of such a breach 
income and other taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax expense and to assess temporary differences resulting from book tax accounting differences for items such as deferred revenue 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that we determine that we would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
significant management judgment is required to determine the valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets  which consist of net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million as of march   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize most of our deferred tax assets before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
we have received inquiries  demands or audit requests from several states and municipal taxing and agencies seeking payment of taxes that are applied to or collected from the customers of providers of traditional public switched telephone network services 
we have consistently maintained that these taxes do not apply to its service for a variety of reasons depending on the statute or rule that establishes such obligations 
we have recorded an expense of  and  for the years ended march  and  respectively  as our estimate of the increase in probable tax exposure for such assessments 
our cumulative estimate for probable assessments is million as of march   which is recorded in the other accrued taxes line item in the consolidated balance sheets 
stock based compensation effective april   we account for our employee stock options and stock purchase rights under the employee stock purchase plan purchase plan under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin  accounting under statement for certain employee stock purchase plans with a look back option and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab  no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant  net of estimated forfeitures 
we have adopted the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas no 
r and  accordingly  financial statement amounts for the prior periods have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing share based compensation 
prior to april   we accounted for stock based awards in accordance with apb  whereby the difference between the exercise price and the fair market value on the date of grant  or the intrinsic value  is recognized as compensation expense 
under the intrinsic value method of accounting  no compensation expense generally was recognized when the exercise price of the employee stock option grants equaled the fair market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
however  to the extent awards were granted either below fair market value or were modified which required a re measurement of compensation costs  we recorded compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal included both the unvested portion of stock based awards granted prior to april  and stock based awards granted subsequent to april  stock options granted in periods prior to fiscal were measured based on sfas no 
criteria  whereas stock options granted subsequent to april  were measured based on sfas no 
r criteria 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we changed our method of attributing the value of stock based compensation to expense from the accelerated multiple option approach to the straight line single option method 
compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted subsequent to april  has been recognized using the straight line single option method 
stock based compensation expense included in fiscal included the impact of estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for the periods prior to fiscal  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
to value option grants and stock purchase rights under the purchase plan for actual and pro forma stock based compensation we used the black scholes option valuation model 
fair value determined using the black scholes option valuation model varies based on assumptions used for the expected stock prices volatility  expected life  risk free interest rates and future dividend payments 
for fiscal years  and  we used the historical volatility of our stock over a period equal to the expected life of the options to their fair value 
the expected life assumptions represent the weighted average period stock based awards are expecting to remain outstanding 
these expected life assumptions were established through the review of historical exercise behavior of stock based award grants with similar vesting periods 
the risk free interest was based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded us treasury securities in the over the counter market for the expected term equal to the expected term of the option 
the dividend yield assumption was based on our history and expectation of future dividend payout 
sfas no 
r requires us to calculate the additional paid in capital pool apic pool available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to adopting sfas no 
r  as if we had adopted sfas no 
at its effective date of january  there are two allowable methods to calculate our apic pool the long form method as set forth in sfas no 
r or the short form method as set forth in fasb staff position no 
r we have elected to use the long form method under which we track each award grant on an employee by employee basis and grant by grant basis to determine if there is a tax benefit or tax deficiency for such award 
we then compared the fair value expense to the tax deduction received for each grant and aggregated the benefits and deficiencies to establish the apic pool 
due to the adoption of sfas no 
r  some exercises result in tax deductions in excess of previously recorded benefits based on the option value at the time of grant  or windfalls 
we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders equity only when realized 
accordingly  we are not recognizing deferred tax assets for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from windfall tax benefits occurring from april  onward 
a windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by the company upon an employee s disposition of a share based award exceeds the deferred tax asset  if any  associated with the award that the company had recorded 
we use the with and without approach as described in emerging issues task force eitf topic no 
d  in determining the order in which our tax attributes are utilized 
the with and without approach results in the recognition of the windfall stock option tax benefits only after all other tax attributes of ours have been considered in the annual tax accrual computation 
also  we have elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of share based compensation deductions in computing our research and development tax and as such  we recognize the full effect of these deductions in the income statement in the period in which the taxable event occurs 
key business metrics we periodically review certain key business metrics  within the context of the performance goals set by management  in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business 
the key business metrics include the following churn average monthly subscriber line churn for a particular period is calculated by dividing the number of lines that terminated during that period by the simple average number of lines during the period and dividing the result by the number of months in the period 
the simple average number of lines during the period is the number of lines on the first day of the period  plus the number of lines on the last day of the period  divided by two however  for this purpose we do not include terminations that occur within the first days after purchasing our service 
we use the churn rate to evaluate whether we are retaining our existing subscribers in accordance with our plans 
churn approximated for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal we believe that the increase in churn from fiscal to fiscal was due to a strengthening in our collection policies and procedures in the first fiscal quarter of combined with an increase in terminations of our residential service because of price increases and competition 
we believe that retaining and building upon our existing subscriber base is critical to our future growth and business success 
therefore  significant increases in our churn rate would be likely to have an adverse impact on our operating results and the value of our business 
subscriber acquisition cost subscriber acquisition cost is defined as the sum of the advertising  marketing  promotions  commissions  rebates and equipment subsidy costs associated with our efforts to acquire new subscribers 
we review this metric to evaluate how effective our marketing programs are in acquiring new subscribers on an economical basis in the context of estimated subscriber lifetime value 
we believe that our subscriber acquisition cost decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal and for fiscal because of customers that we acquired when their previous voip providers exited the business 
acquiring those subscribers required limited marketing and resulted in a reduced customer acquisition expense 
we believe it is useful to monitor these metrics together and not individually as it does not make business decisions based upon any single metric 
results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
revenues year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands service revenues     percentage of total revenues service revenues consist primarily of revenues attributable to the provision of our packet services and royalties earned under our voip technology licenses 
we expect that packet service revenues will continue to comprise nearly all of our service revenues for the foreseeable future 
the increase in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  was primarily attributable to a million increase in packet service revenues attributable to the growth in the virtual office subscriber base and an increase in the price of our service instituted on march  the packet virtual office subscriber base grew from approximately  customers at the end of fiscal to approximately  on march  our residential customer base did not significantly change between the end of fiscal and as the decline in our existing customer base was offset by the transition of a competitor s former customers to the packet residential service 
we also recognized a million one time increase in revenue due to a ruling by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia that eliminated a requirement that we obtain pre approval of traffic studies in determining the portion of revenues subject to federal universal service contributions 
by retroactively applying our traffic study contribution rate to the historical subscriber retail revenues  we were able to reduce the related accrued liability and recognize a corresponding amount of revenue in the first fiscal quarter of the increase in service revenues during fiscal was offset by a reduction of million reduction to our wholesale service and royalty revenues primarily due to the termination of the agreement with bellsouth in the fourth fiscal quarter of in connection with its merger with at t 
the increase in fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  was primarily attributable to a million increase in packet service revenues attributed to the growth in the packet virtual office subscriber base 
in the second half of fiscal  we redirected our marketing from targeting residential customers to marketing our packet virtual office services to small businesses 
the packet virtual office subscriber base grew from under  customers at the end of fiscal to approximately  customers on march  our residential customer base did not increase during that period in part because effective march   we increased the monthly service fees on our unlimited residential service and unlimited business service for existing customers by and  respectively  and by and  respectively  for new customers who subscribed to the service after march  license and royalty revenues associated with our technology licensing and hosted ipbx product decreased by million from million to million 
in addition  we recognized million wholesale service revenue in fiscal compared to million in fiscal related to the bellsouth agreement 
year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands product revenues     percentage of total revenues product revenues consist of revenues from sales of voip terminal adapters  telephones and videophones  primarily attributable to our packet service 
for fiscal year  product revenues also included sales of voip semiconductors and other system products of million 
the decrease in fiscal year from fiscal year  was primarily attributable to a million decrease in product revenue attributable to residential customers as we redirected our marketing away from residential customers to marketing our packet virtual office services to small businesses 
in addition  we waived the regular start up costs  which include the equipment cost associated with residential service plans  as part of the transition of a competitor s former customers to the packet service 
the decrease in residential customer product revenues during fiscal partially was offset by an increase of million in product revenue attributable to the growth in the packet virtual office subscriber base 
product revenues increased in fiscal year from fiscal year because of the shift in marketing from residential customers to small businesses which resulted in an increase in new subscriptions to the packet virtual office service 
residential customers were not charged for terminal adapters but paid a activation fee 
for the virtual office service we charged for each telephone plus a activation fee 
no single customer represented more than of our total revenues during fiscal  or sales to customers outside the united states represented  and of total revenues in the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the following table illustrates our net revenues by geographic area 
revenues are attributed to countries based on the destination of shipment in thousands years ended march  united states    other locations year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands cost of service revenues    percentage of service revenues cost of service revenues the cost of service revenues primarily consists of costs associated with network operations and related personnel  telephony origination and termination services provided by third party carriers and technology license and royalty expenses 
cost of service revenues for fiscal compared with fiscal decreased million due to a price reduction by third party network service vendors and our switch to the use of multiple third party network provider vendors throughout fiscal and that switch allowed us to route call traffic to the third party network provider vendor who provides the most favorable pricing to us 
the increase in cost of service revenues in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in third party telephony origination and termination service fees and other costs due to the growth in the packet subscriber base 
cost of product revenues year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands cost of product revenues     percentage of product revenues the cost of product revenues consists of costs associated with systems  components  system manufacturing  assembly and testing performed by third party vendors  estimated warranty obligations and direct and indirect costs associated with product purchasing  scheduling  quality assurance  shipping and handling 
we generally do not charge packet residential subscribers for the terminal adapters used to provide our service when they subscribe through our website 
we also have offered incentives to customers who purchase terminal adapters in our retail channels to offset the customer s cost of the equipment purchased from a retailer 
we allocate a portion of packet service revenues to product revenues but these revenues are less than the cost of the terminal adapters 
the decrease in the cost of product revenues for fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a million reduction in shipments of residential and videophone equipment and a million reduction in product reserves as we eliminated a royalty expense accrual after determining that we were unlikely to pay royalties in the future 
cost of product revenues during fiscal included an increase of million for shipments of equipment attributable to growth in the packet virtual office subscriber base and a million increase in costs from the write off of equipment shipped to a failed retailer 
the decrease in cost of product revenues in fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from lower cost terminal adapters for the entire year rather than for part of the year  as in fiscal in addition  we shipped fewer residential terminal adapters and packet videophones in fiscal than the decrease in expenses was partially offset by an increase in packet virtual office equipment sales 
research and development expenses year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands research and development    percentage of total revenues historically  our research and development expenses have consisted primarily of personnel  system prototype design  and equipment costs necessary for us to conduct our development and engineering efforts 
we expense research and development costs  including software development costs  as they are incurred 
the decrease in research and development expenses for fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to a million decrease in contractor headcount expenses 
research and development expenses declined due to employees and contractors leaving the company and difficulty in recruiting research and development employees to replace these departures 
the decrease in research and development expenses for fiscal from fiscal was primarily attributable to a million decrease in personnel and contractor headcount expenses  net of million in sfas r stock based compensation expense 
a total of million of the decrease from to was related to the departure of the company s vice chairman in january selling  general and administrative expenses year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands selling  general and administrative    percentage of total revenues selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  customer support  finance  human resources and general management 
such costs also include outsourced customer service call center operations  sales commissions  as well as trade show  advertising and other marketing and promotional expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a million increase in additional employee and temporary personnel costs and a million increase in advertising  public relations  and other marketing and promotional expenses 
this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in sales agent and retailer commissions and a million decrease in sales and use tax expenses as the company began to collect and remit taxes in states outside of california 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal from fiscal consisted primarily of a million increase in compensation expense for personnel due to headcount additions  a million increase in contractor expenses relating to the increase in staffing of our customer service organizations  a million increase in credit card transaction processing fees  a million increase in sales and use tax expense  a million increase in advertising and other marketing and promotional expenses  a million increase in legal fees  a million increase in sales agent and retailer commissions and a million increase in external auditor and tax expenses 
we also reported million in sfas r stock based compensation expense in fiscal  which expenses were not required to be included in this line item in fiscal interest income and other  net year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands interest income and other  net  percentage of total revenues our interest income and other  net  primarily consists of interest and investment income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 
the increase in other income consists primarily of million from the sale of two patents offset by a reduction in interest and investment income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and investment balances of million due to lower average cash balances and interest rates 
the decrease in other income for fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily lower interest income on lower average cash balances 
income on change in fair value of warrant liability year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands income on change in fair value of warrant liability   percentage of total revenues in connection with the sale of shares of our common stock in fiscal and  we issued warrants in three different equity financings 
the warrants included a provision that we must deliver freely tradable shares upon exercise of the warrant 
because there are circumstances that may not be within our control that could prevent delivery of registered shares  eitf requires the warrants be recorded as a liability at fair value with subsequent changes in fair value recorded as a gain or loss 
the fair value of the warrant is determined using a black scholes option pricing model  and is affected by changes in inputs to that model including our stock price  expected stock price volatility and contractual term 
to the extent that the fair value of the warrant liability increases or decreases  we record a loss or income in our statement of operations 
the amount we record as a liability under eitf is not  nor do we intend for it to be  an admission or stipulation of the amount that we would owe or be obligated to pay the warrant holder in the event of an actual breach by us of the warrant terms 
in fact  we have made no determination of the amount of liability  if any  that we would owe to the warrant holder in the event of such a breach 
the decrease in the income from change in fair value of warrants in fiscal from fiscal occurred because the fair value of warrants and warrant liability declined due to a reduction in our stock price  expected stock price volatility and contractual life of the warrants 
furthermore  on august   we and the warrant holders amended the terms of warrants to purchase  shares of common stock that we had classified as liabilities 
the amended warrants met the requirement to be classified as equity and accordingly  they were reclassified from liability to equity 
a total of million of the income from the change in fair value of the warrants in fiscal was related to the amended warrants and million was reclassified from liability to equity 
the remaining investor warrants for  shares of common stock issued on december  have not been amended and will continue to be accounted for as liabilities until exercised or expiration in december the increase in the income from change in fair value of warrants in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to a reduction in the fair value of warrants resulting from a decline in our stock price  expected stock price volatility and contractual life of the warrants which are the primary assumptions applied to the black scholes model which we have used to calculate the fair value of the warrants 
benefit from income taxes year ended march  year over year change to to dollar amounts in thousands benefit from income taxes percentage of total revenues we had no provision for income taxes in any of the fiscal years ended march   and at march   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  that expire at various dates beginning in and continuing through in addition  at march   we had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state tax reporting purposes of approximately million and million  respectively 
the federal credit carryforwards will begin expiring in continuing through  while the california credit will carryforward indefinitely 
under the ownership change limitations of the internal revenue code of  as amended  the amount and benefit from the net operating losses and credit carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
at march  and  we had gross deferred tax assets of approximately million and million  respectively 
because of uncertainties regarding the realization of deferred tax assets  we have applied a full valuation allowance as of march  and liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million in investments in marketable securities for a combined total of million 
by comparison  at march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  and million in investments for a combined total of million 
we currently have no borrowing arrangements 
our cash and cash equivalents balance increased million and the combined balance increased by million during fiscal the increase in cash  cash equivalents and investments was primarily attributable to a million of cash from operating activities  including million due to the sale of two patents  and million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under employee stock plans  partially offset by million of capital expenditures  as discussed below 
although we have achieved positive cash flows from operations in the fiscal year ended march   historical net losses and negative cash flows have been funded primarily through the issuance of equity securities and borrowings 
we believe that current cash  cash equivalents and investments will be sufficient to finance our operations for at least the next months 
however  we continually evaluate our cash needs and may pursue additional equity or debt financing in order to achieve our overall business objectives 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available  or  if available  at a price or terms that are acceptable to us 
failure to generate sufficient revenues  raise additional capital or reduce certain discretionary spending could have an adverse impact on our ability to achieve our longer term business objectives 
in addition  any such financing may be materially dilutive to our existing stockholders 
the following discussion of cash flows for the past three fiscal years provides information about our liquidity and changes in financial condition during these periods 
comparison of fiscal and cash provided by operations of million in fiscal compared with cash used by operations of million in fiscal  showed an improvement of million 
the decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a decrease in the net loss of million adjusted for non cash items  including the change in the fair value of warrants of million  depreciation and amortization of million and stock based compensation of million 
accounts receivable represented a use of cash of million in fiscal compared with a use of cash of million in fiscal the increase in cash used by accounts receivable of million in from the level was primarily due to a million increase with an existing retailer  royalty revenue of million  shipment of equipment to new retailer of million and signing of license agreement of million 
inventories represented a source of cash of million in fiscal compared with a use of cash of million in fiscal the increase in cash used by inventory of million in from levels was primarily due to a sell through of residential customer premise equipment  a decrease in the purchase of customer premise equipment and a reduction in purchase prices 
accrued taxes and fees represented a source of cash of million in fiscal compared with a source of cash of million in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by accrued taxes and fees of million was primarily due to reduction of accrued sales and use tax as we are now collecting and remitting sales tax in several states 
deferred revenue represented a source of cash of million in fiscal compared with a use of cash of million in fiscal the increase in the source of cash of million in fiscal from the levels during fiscal was primarily due to deferral of new annual plan subscriptions entered into during fiscal and shipments of equipment to retailers 
cash provided by investing activities of million for fiscal was primarily attributable to the maturity or sale of million of investments 
the cash provided by investing activities was offset by a use of cash for the purchase of investments of million and million of purchases of fixed assets 
the purchases of fixed assets were primarily attributable to equipment required by the growth of the packet virtual office subscriber base 
cash provided by financing activities of approximately million in fiscal consisted primarily of million of net proceeds received from the sale of our common stock to employees through our employee stock purchase and stock option plans 
comparison of fiscal and cash used in operations of million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  represented an improvement of million 
the decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a reduction in the net loss of million adjusted for a decrease in non cash items including the change in the fair value of warrants of million  offset by an increase in stock based compensation expense of million and depreciation and amortization of million

at march   we have a  liability related to warrants issued to two investors in an equity financing transaction in fiscal we account for these warrants as liabilities because of the possibility  however likely or unlikely  that we would be unable to deliver registered shares upon a future exercise of these warrants 
the required accounting for a warrant with an assumed net cash settlement provision under eitf is to estimate the fair value on the date of issuance and to record a liability equal to that value with subsequent changes in the fair value recorded as income or expense at the end of each reporting period under eitf 
the amount we record as a liability under eitf is not  nor do we intend for it to be  an admission or stipulation of the amount that we would owe or be obligated to pay the warrant holder in the event that we are unable to deliver registered shares to the warrant holder 
in fact  we have made no determination of the amount of liability  if any  that we would owe to the warrant holder in the event of such a breach

recent accounting pronouncements in march  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
how taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf no 

eitf provides that the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on revenue producing transactions eg sales  use  and excise taxes between a seller and a customer on either a gross basis included in revenues and costs or on a net basis excluded from revenues is an accounting policy decision that should be disclosed 
in addition  for any such taxes that are reported on a gross basis  the amounts of those taxes should be disclosed in interim and annual financial statements for each period for which an income statement is presented if those amounts are significant

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk  we may maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  debt securities and certificates of deposit 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on our interest income 
during the years ended march  and  we did not have any outstanding debt instruments other than equipment under capital leases and  therefore  we were not exposed to market risk relating to interest rates
