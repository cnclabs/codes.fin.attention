potential tax payments in connection with the independent review by the audit committee of the company s historical stock option granting practices see the explanatory note preceding part i  item of the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended march  for more information regarding the audit committee s review and related matters  the company determined that a number of officers may have exercised options for which the application of section m of the code may apply

for purposes of this form k  these below fair market value stock option grants are referred to as affected stock option grants 
under section a  individuals who hold affected stock option grants may be subject to a federal income tax and an interest penalty tax in addition to the regular income tax liability plus interest on the value of these stock option grants at the time of vesting not exercise 

table of contents during the third quarter of fiscal  the company conducted a tender offer to current non officer employees subject to taxation in the united states who held affected stock option grants that afforded those employees the opportunity to avoid unfavorable tax consequences under section a

additionally  and as part of the tender offer  the company offered current non officer employees the right to receive a cash payment equal to the increase  if any  in the exercise price of any affected stock option grant 
in instances where the original exercise price of a stock option grant was less than the new exercise price as determined above  the company increased the original exercise price to the new exercise price an amended stock option grant and paid a cash bonus to the employee

revised  share based payment sfas r 
as a result of the modification and the partial cash settlement  the company recognized of additional stock based compensation expense due to the increase in the fair market value of these stock option grants that is recorded in selling  general administrative expense within the company s consolidated statements of income 
in instances where the current exercise price of a stock option grant was greater than the new exercise price  the original stock option grant was canceled and immediately replaced with a new stock option grant under the stock option plan  as amended the employee plan that has the same terms as the canceled stock option grant  including the same exercise price per share and no loss of vesting or change to the expiration date of the stock option grant term  but with a new grant date a cancellation and new stock option grant 
each cancellation and new stock option grant qualifies as a cancellation of an award accompanied by the concurrent grant of a replacement award  as defined in sfas r  which is accounted for as a modification 
under sfas r  incremental compensation cost is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair market value of the modified award over the fair market value of the original award immediately before its terms are modified 
with respect to the cancellation and new stock option grants  there were no changes to any of the terms of the original affected stock option grants 
thus  the company recorded of non cash stock based compensation expense for these grants

legal proceedings please also see the matters discussed in part i  item  legal proceedings  of this form k  which information is incorporated herein by reference 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ 
the company bases its estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believes them to be reasonable for the circumstances 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable as an offset to accounts receivable in order to present a net balance the company believes will be collected 
this allowance is based on both recent trends of certain accounts receivable specific reserve estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire accounts receivable pool general reserve 
the company computes a specific reserve by identifying specifically at risk accounts receivable and applying historic reserve factors to the outstanding balance 
the company computes a general reserve by reviewing the accounts receivable aging and applying reserve factors based upon the age of the account receivable 
if the estimate of uncollectible accounts receivable should prove inaccurate at some future date  the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents inventories the company s inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value and has been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the company records an estimate for slow moving and obsolete inventory inventory reserve based upon product knowledge  physical inventory observation  future demand  market conditions and an aging analysis of the inventory on hand 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management at some future date  the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the inventory reserve 
deferred income taxes the company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets related to events that impact the company s financial statements and tax returns in different periods 
deferred tax asset and liability balances are computed by identifying differences between the book basis and tax basis of assets and liabilities temporary differences which are multiplied by the current tax rate 
a valuation allowance is provided on deferred tax assets if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized 
if the company s estimate of the realizable deferred tax assets should prove inaccurate at some future date  the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by any necessary correction to the deferred tax asset allowance 
long lived assets other than goodwill the company reviews long lived assets  including property  plant  equipment and indefinite definite lived intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the estimated future cash flows undiscounted expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of an asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset 
no impairments of long lived assets have been identified during any of the periods presented 
goodwill the company s goodwill is subject to  at a minimum  an annual impairment assessment of its carrying value 
goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
estimated fair values of the reporting units are estimated using an earnings model and a discounted cash flow valuation model 
the discounted cash flow model incorporates the company s estimates of future cash flows  allocations of certain assets and cash flows among reporting units  future growth rates and management s judgment regarding the applicable discount rates used to discount those estimated cash flows 
if the company s estimates and assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation model should prove inaccurate at some future date  the results of operations for the period could be materially affected by an impairment of goodwill 
no impairment of goodwill has been identified during any of the periods presented 
loss contingencies the company incurs contingencies as a normal part of its business operations  such as future warranty obligations and potential liabilities relating to legal or regulatory matters 
the company accrues for contingent obligations when a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
restructuring costs the company accrues the cost of restructuring activities in accordance with the appropriate accounting guidance depending upon the facts and circumstances surrounding the situation 
the company exercises its judgment in estimating the total costs of each of these activities 
as these activities are implemented  the actual costs may differ from the estimated costs due to changes in the facts and circumstances that were not foreseen at the time of the initial cost accrual 
revenue recognition within the company s hotline services service type  revenues are recognized when title to products sold passes to the customer  which generally occurs upon shipment from the company s location 
within the company s data services and voice services service types  revenues are recognized from maintenance service contracts  moves  adds and changes and network integration services when the services are provided 
service contracts are generally pre billed  recorded in deferred revenue within the company s consolidated balance sheets and are generally recognized over the service period on a straight line basis 
revenues from the sale and installation of products and systems are recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated loss is recognized immediately in the financial statements 
the company has historically made reasonably accurate estimates of the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs on its long term contracts 
however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  actual results could differ materially from those estimates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business that include interest rate volatility and foreign currency exchange rates volatility 
market risk is measured as the potential negative impact on earnings  cash flows or fair values resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates over the next year 
the company does not hold or issue any other financial derivative instruments other than those specifically noted below nor does it engage in speculative trading of financial derivatives 
interest rate risk the company s primary interest rate risk relates to its long term debt obligations 
as of march   the company had total long term obligations of  under the new credit agreement 
of the outstanding debt   was in variable rate debt that was effectively converted to a fixed rate through an interest rate swap agreement during fiscal and  was in variable rate obligations 
as of march   an instantaneous basis point increase in the interest rate of the variable rate debt would reduce the company s net income in the subsequent fiscal year by net of tax assuming the company employed no intervention strategies 
to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations associated with the company s variable rate long term debt  the company has implemented an interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant unplanned fluctuations in earnings caused by interest rate volatility 
the company s goal is to manage interest rate sensitivity by modifying the re pricing characteristics of certain balance sheet liabilities so that the net interest margin is not  on a material basis  adversely affected by the movements in interest rates 
on july   the company entered into an interest rate swap which has been used to effectively convert a portion of the company s variable rate debt to fixed rate 
the interest rate swap has a notional value of  reducing to  after three years and does not qualify for hedge accounting 
changes in the fair market value of the interest rate swap are recorded as an asset or liability within the company s consolidated balance sheets and interest expense income within the company s consolidated statements of income 

table of contents foreign exchange rate risk the company has operations  clients and suppliers worldwide  thereby exposing the company s financial results to foreign currency fluctuations 
in an effort to reduce this risk of foreign currency fluctuations  the company generally sells and purchases inventory based on prices denominated in us dollars 
intercompany sales to subsidiaries are generally denominated in the subsidiaries local currency 
the company has entered and will continue in the future  on a selective basis  to enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the foreign currency exposure related to certain intercompany transactions  primarily trade receivables and loans 
all of the foreign currency forward contracts have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges 
the effective portion of any changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments is recorded in aoci until the hedged forecasted transaction occurs or the recognized currency transaction affects earnings 
once the forecasted transaction occurs or the recognized currency transaction affects earnings  the effective portion of any related gains or losses on the cash flow hedge is reclassified from aoci to the company s consolidated statements of income 
in the event it becomes probable that the hedged forecasted transaction will not occur  the ineffective portion of any gain or loss on the related cash flow hedge would be reclassified from aoci to the company s consolidated statements of income 
as of march   the company had open foreign exchange contracts in australian and canadian dollars  danish krone  euros  mexican pesos  norwegian kroner  pounds sterling  swedish krona  swiss francs and japanese yen 
the open contracts have contract rates ranging from to australian dollar  to canadian dollar  to danish krone  to euro  to mexican peso  to norwegian kroner  to pounds sterling  to swedish krona  to swiss franc and to japanese yen  all per us dollar
