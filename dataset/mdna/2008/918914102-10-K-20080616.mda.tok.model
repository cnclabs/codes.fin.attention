item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general we develop  manufacture and sell high energy power systems utilizing our proprietary phosphate based lithium ion technology for diverse applications  with special emphasis on portable appliances and future generations of hybrid and electric vehicles 
our mission is to promote the wide adoption of high performance  safe  long cycle life  environmentally friendly  low cost energy storage systems and address the significant market opportunity we believe is available to us by drawing on the numerous benefits of our epoch lithium phosphate energy storage systems battery technology  deep intellectual property portfolio  and the extensive experience of our management team 
total revenue in fiscal was million  an increase of compared to the prior fiscal year 
we believe revenue will continue to grow in fiscal year from new customer sales from the increasing demand in the us and emea europe  middle east and africa markets for alternative energy solution systems 
our gross margin continues to increase as sales grow and the manufacturing costs decrease from continued improvements in quality and efficiency 
we are continuing to expand the capacity of china manufacturing and support operations in our two wholly owned subsidiaries 
going concern as a result of our limited cash resources and history of operating losses that there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we presently have no further commitments for financing by our chairman carl berg and or his affiliates or any other source 
if we are unable to obtain financing from mr 
berg or others on terms acceptable to us  or at all  we may be forced to cease all operations and liquidate our assets 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in our operations  including the failure to achieve expected revenues  greater than expected expenses  changes in oem relationships  market conditions  the failure to timely realize our product development goals  and other adverse developments 
these events could have a negative impact on our available liquidity sources during fiscal highlights key product introductions and milestones based on our epoch and lithium phosphate technology during the current year include in february  we entered into a supply agreement with the tanfield group  plc tanfield whereby we agreed to manufacture and supply lithium phosphate energy storage systems to power zero emission  all electric commercial delivery vehicles 
our battery systems will be installed in leading edge vans and trucks produced by tanfield s uk based trading division  smith electric vehicles 
initial purchases  which began in the fiscal fourth quarter ended march  were fulfilled with our current u charge brand of energy storage systems 
subsequent purchases by tanfield will be fulfilled by our u charge energy storage systems and ultimately by our third generation lithium phosphate epoch energy storage systems 
in november  we introduced the epoch lithium phosphate energy storage system  our new generation of phosphate based lithium ion battery 
the epoch lithium phosphate energy storage systems are equipped with an advanced management system that will monitor and adjust cell performance  so battery packs will operate at their optimum performance capacity 
epoch lithium phosphate energy storage systems present a safer and more powerful and reliable energy source storage solution designed to be low maintenance  cost competitive  and environmentally friendly 
during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  we continued our efforts to increase production capacity at our subsidiaries in china 
we also continue to explore other ways of expanding capacity  including partnerships with other companies 
our research and development efforts are focused on the design of new products utilizing our lithium phosphate chemistry  the continuous improvement of the manufacturing process of our second generation lithium phosphate technology  the development of different cell constructions to optimize power and size for new applications  as well as developing future materials based on the lithium phosphate technology platform 
our business headquarters is in austin  texas 
our materials research and development center is in las vegas  nevada 
our european sales and oem manufacturing support center is in mallusk  northern ireland 
our manufacturing and product development center is in suzhou  china

the decrease in revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to decreased sales of n charge power systems as a result of ceasing sales through our retail channels 
we expect sales of the n charge power system to be reduced in fiscal as we discontinue the product 
we had  and  in deferred revenue on our balance sheet at march  and march   respectively  primarily related to sales shipping in the end of the fourth quarter 
in fiscal  we launched our long range battery pack for use in segway s human transporter as well as further expansions of our u charge family of products 
segway sales accounted for  and of our total product sales in  and we expect sales of the large format battery system to increase during fiscal  due to the growing demand of the new epoch tm lithium phosphate energy storage systems and the fulfillment of our current back orders and sales agreements 
the large format battery system sales represent   and of our total revenue for fiscal  and the growth in large format battery systems sales are due to the increase in demand in alternative energy solutions driven by the rising costs of fossil fuels 
licensing and royalty revenue licensing and royalty revenues relate to revenue from licensing agreements for our battery construction technology 
fiscal licensing and royalty revenue was  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal licensing and royalty revenue was substantially from our license agreement with amperex technology limited  which makes on going royalty payments as sales are made using our technology

the gross margin increased during fiscal as we worked to reduce the amount of scrap material in the production process 
in fiscal  the improvement in our manufacturing efficiency has increased our gross margin 
during fiscal  million of share based compensation was allocated to manufacturing overhead expenses 
we expect cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  to continue to decrease during fiscal as production volumes increase  we continue to implement our lower cost manufacturing strategy and our efficiency improves

interest expense fluctuations are a result of changes in the underlying interest rate on one of the loans  which is indexed to the libor rate 
liquidity and capital resources at march   our principal source of liquidity was cash and cash equivalents of million 
we do not expect our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs for the next twelve months following march  nor do we anticipate product sales during fiscal will be sufficient to cover our operating expenses 
historically  we have relied upon management s ability to periodically arrange for additional equity or debt financing to meet our liquidity requirements 
unless our product sales are greater than management currently forecasts or there are other changes to our business plan  we will need to arrange for additional financing to fund operating and capital needs 
this financing could take the form of debt or equity 
given our historical operating results and the amount of our existing debt  as well as the other factors  we may not be able to arrange for debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in our operations including the failure to achieve expected revenues  greater than expected expenses  changes in oem relationships  market conditions  the failure to timely realize the company s product development goals  and other adverse developments

basis of presentation  critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  exit costs  contract settlement charges  and joint venture dissolution 
our accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  note  summary of significant accounting policies 
the following further describes the methods and assumptions we use in our critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition we generate revenues from sales of products including batteries and battery systems  and from licensing fees and royalties per technology license agreements 
product sales are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
product shipments that are not recognized as revenue during the period shipped  primarily product shipments to resellers that are subject to right of return  are recorded as deferred revenue and reflected as a liability on our balance sheet 
products shipped with the rights of return are included in finished goods inventory as we retain title to the products 
for reseller shipments where revenue recognition is deferred  we record revenue and relieve inventory based upon the reseller supplied reporting of sales to their end customers or their inventory reporting 
for direct customers  we estimate a return rate percentage based upon our historical experience 
from time to time we provide sales incentives in the form of rebates or other price adjustments  these are generally recorded as reductions to revenue on the latter of the date the related revenue is recognized or at the time the rebate or sales incentive is offered 
licensing fees are recognized as revenue upon completion of an executed agreement and delivery of licensed information  if there are no significant remaining vendor obligations and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalty revenues are recognized upon licensee revenue reporting and when collection is reasonably assured 
impairment of long lived assets we perform a review of long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
if long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value and is recorded in the period the determination was made

recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
sfas is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring enhanced disclosures to enable investors to better understand the effects of the derivative instruments on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
the company will adopt sfas on april  we are currently assessing the potential impact of sfas on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r business combinations sfas r 
this statement establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the guidance will become effective as of the beginning of a company s fiscal year beginning after december  we believe that this new pronouncement will not have a material impact on our financial statements in future periods 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits an entity to elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for many financial assets and liabilities 
entities electing the fair value option would be required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings 
entities electing the fair value option are required to distinguish  on the face of the statement of financial position  the fair value of assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected and similar assets and liabilities measured using another measurement attribute 
sfas no 
is effective for the company s current fiscal year 
the adjustment to reflect the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of initial adoption 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
specifically  this statement sets forth a definition of fair value  and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques  giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
the provisions of sfas no 
are generally required to be applied on a prospective basis  except to certain financial instruments accounted for under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  for which the provisions of sfas no 
should be applied retrospectively 
sfas no 
is required to be adopted in the first quarter of the company s fiscal year 
the company is still evaluating the effect  if any  on its financial position or results of operations
