item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a clinical stage biotechnology company organized as a delaware corporation in and engaged in the research and development of innovative cancer therapeutics 
our mission is to introduce novel products that act selectively against cancer cells  target multiple tumor types and are well tolerated by patients 
we believe our clinical stage products represent potential best in class or first in class small molecule candidates based on highly differentiated mechanisms of action 
our lead products  which are in clinical stage testing  consist of arq  an orally administered inhibitor of the c met receptor tyrosine kinase  arq  an intravenously administered novel activator of the cell s dna damage response mechanism mediated by the ef transcription factor  and arq  an intravenously administered second generation activator of ef early stage clinical trial results  which are available for arq and arq  have demonstrated anti cancer activity across multiple types of tumors 
we retain full worldwide commercial rights to arq outside of japan and certain other asian countries  where we have granted commercial rights to kyowa hakko kogyo co  ltd 
kyowa 
we are developing arq  arq and arq a new chemical entity based on arq pursuant to our collaboration with hoffmann la roche roche 
our agreements with these partners provide for possible future milestone payments  royalties on product sales  and development funding  in addition to payments that we have already received 
our pre clinical programs are directed toward molecular targets that we believe play critical roles in the development of human cancers 
the targets  mechanisms of action and chemistry related to compounds generated from these programs differ  offering the potential for multiple therapeutic opportunities 
the most advanced of these programs are focused on the development of inhibitors of the eg kinesin spindle protein and the b raf kinase 
toxicology testing is planned to begin in with a product candidate from the eg program 
additional molecular targets being explored in other pre clinical programs 
our products and research programs are based on our understanding of biological processes that lead to the proliferation and metastasis of cancer cells  combined with our ability to generate product candidates possessing certain pre selected  drug like properties and designed to act with specificity against cancer cells 
we believe that these qualities  when present from the earliest stages of product development  increase the likelihood of producing safe  effective and marketable drugs 
we believe that our combined expertise in chemistry and cancer biology differentiates us from other companies with a similar stage of evolution 
we will be focusing and advancing a significant portion of our drug discovery efforts based on our newly acquired understanding of the way arq binds to c met 
insights into this novel binding mechanism form the basis of a discovery platform that we plan to leverage to generate a new type of selective kinase inhibitors 
these compounds will be designed to inhibit a variety of kinases potently  selectively and without competing with atp adenosine triphosphate  an energy source for cells 
we are currently assessing the potential of multiple kinases as targets for this drug discovery platform  and we are seeking to generate and validate compounds that inhibit these kinase targets with mechanisms similar to that of arq in september  we announced a strategic decision to exit our pre existing chemistry services operations in order to focus operationally on developing our oncology portfolio 
revenue from our chemistry services operations terminated in as a result of our strategic decision to no longer provide these services and the subsequent decision by pfizer to terminate its collaborative agreement agreement with us effective may  we did not incur any financial penalty as a result of termination 
we continued to provide chemistry services to pfizer pursuant to the agreement through the effective date of termination 
since december  we produced for pfizer annually an average of approximately  synthetic chemical compounds and received average annual cash payments of approximately million for those compounds and related services 
the agreement provided for six months prior written notice by either party to the other for termination without cause and  in the event of termination by pfizer  certain payments to us 
in accordance with these provisions  we received approximately million in december in connection with the termination 
we considered the chemistry services asset group to be a component of an entity  as defined in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  since it comprised operations and cash flows that were clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the remainder of the company s operations 
pursuant to sfas  we reported the results of the chemistry services component as discontinued operations in the year ended december  since their related cash flows were eliminated from our ongoing operations and we did not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component or the assets that were disposed 
we have incurred a cumulative net loss of million from inception through december  we expect research and development costs to increase in  due to clinical testing of our lead product candidates 
although we have generated positive cash flow from operations for six consecutive years from  these cash flows were attributable to our discontinued chemistry services operations 
we recorded a net loss for all but one of those years 
we recorded a net loss for and  and expect a net loss for our revenue consists primarily of development funding from our alliances with roche and kyowa 
revenue and expenses fluctuate from quarter to quarter based upon a number of factors  notably the timing and extent of our cancer related research and development activities together with the length and outcome of our clinical trials 
on april   we announced an alliance with roche to discover and develop drug candidates targeting the ef biological pathway  including arq under the terms of the agreement  roche obtained an option to license our ef program in the field of cancer therapy 
roche provided immediate research funding of million  and is providing financial support for ongoing research and development 
under this alliance  we are responsible for advancing drug candidates from early stage development to phase trials 
roche may opt to license worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of products resulting from this collaboration by paying an option fee 
assuming the successful development and commercialization of a compound under the program  we could receive up to million in pre determined payments  plus royalties based on net sales 
additionally  we have the option to co promote products in the us on april   we entered into an exclusive license agreement with kyowa to develop and commercialize arq  a small molecule  selective inhibitor of the c met receptor tyrosine kinase  in japan and parts of asia 
a million portion of an upfront licensing fee was received by the company under this agreement in the first quarter of and an additional million in upfront licensing fees was received on may  the agreement includes million in upfront and potential development milestone payments from kyowa to arqule  including the million cash upfront licensing payments 
in addition  the agreement includes sales milestone payments 
upon commercialization  arqule will receive double digit royalties from kyowa on net sales of arq kyowa will be responsible for all clinical development costs and commercialization of the compound in certain asian countries  consisting of japan  china including hong kong  south korea and taiwan 
liquidity and capital resources increase decrease december  to to in millions cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital in millions cash flow from operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flow from operating activities 
our uses of cash for operating activities have primarily consisted of salaries and wages for our employees  facility and facility related costs for our offices and laboratories  fees paid in connection with preclinical and clinical studies  laboratory supplies and materials  and professional fees 
the sources of our cash flow from operating activities have consisted primarily of payments from our collaborators for services performed or upfront payments for future services 
in  our net use of cash was primarily driven by the difference between cash receipts from our collaborators  and payments for operating expenses which resulted in a net cash outflow of million 
cash flow from investing activities 
our net cash used by investing activities of million in was comprised of net purchases of marketable securities of million and acquisitions of fixed assets of million 
the composition and mix of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities may change frequently as a result of the company s constant evaluation of conditions in financial markets  the maturity of specific investments  and our near term liquidity needs 
our cash equivalents and marketable securities include money market funds  corporate bonds and us federal and state agency backed certificates  including auction rate securities and other investment grade debt securities that have strong credit ratings 
our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates 
auction rate securities are securities that are structured with short term interest rate reset dates of generally less than ninety days but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years 
at the end of each reset period  which occurs every seven to twenty eight days  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
these securities are subject to fluctuations in fair value depending on the supply and demand at each auction 
in the first quarter of  certain auction rate securities failed auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
we will review our portfolio at the end of the quarter ending march   taking into consideration other than temporary impairment factors  to conclude whether arqule has an impairment 
if we determine there is an impairment  it would be recorded in the quarter ended march  within other comprehensive loss if related to a temporary impairment  and in the statement of operations if related to an other than temporary impairment related to these auction rate securities 
arqule s marketable securities portfolio as of december  was million 
the portfolio included million at cost invested in auction rate securities of which  million at cost are associated with auctions that failed subsequent to february  subsequent to december   arqule was able to sell at par million of auction rate securities that were held at december  in addition  certain of auction rate securities totaling million were called for redemption and accordingly we expect to receive payment by the end of march the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or the underlying securities have matured 
although we were cash flow positive from operations from through  we were not cash flow positive from operations in or  nor do we expect to be cash flow positive in  as a result of our decision to exit our chemistry services operations and the increased cost of developing our clinical candidates 
given the current liquidity constraints in the auction rate securities market  and depending on decisions we may make regarding our clinical trials  we expect that our available cash and marketable securities  together with cash from operations and investment income  will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital requirements at least through the first quarter of pending increased stability and liquidity in the auction rate securities market  we believe we can fund our operations through the end of cash flow from financing activities 
our net cash provided by financing activities of million in the year ended december  was comprised primarily of the proceeds from our june stock offering  wherein we sold million shares of common stock at per share for aggregate net proceeds of million after commissions and offering expenses 
during july  the company received net proceeds of million when the underwriters exercised a portion of their over allotment option and purchased an additional  shares of common stock 
stock option exercises and employee stock plan purchases provided additional cash inflow of million 
in january  we completed a stock offering in which we sold million shares of common stock at per share for net proceeds of approximately million after commissions and offering expenses 
on may   we completed a transaction to sell our woburn facility and simultaneously lease the facility from the purchaser 
the lease was subsequently amended on june  under the terms of the transaction  the purchaser obtained two parcels of land and our headquarters building in exchange for a cash payment of approximately million  net of commissions and closing costs 
we are leasing our existing facility and the associated land for a period of ten years at an average annual rental rate of million 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned depending upon the results of our drug discovery and development strategies  our ability to enter into additional corporate collaborations and the terms of such collaborations  results of research and development  unanticipated required capital expenditures  competitive and technological advances  acquisitions and other factors 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to develop any of our drug candidates into a commercial product 
it is likely we will need to raise additional capital or incur indebtedness to continue to fund our operations in the future 
our ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial  economic and market conditions and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to us when required  on satisfactory terms  or at all 
if necessary funds are not available  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate some of our development programs  potentially delaying the time to market for any of our product candidates 
our contractual obligations were comprised of the following as of december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations     purchase obligations   total      included in the total minimum payments for operating leases is approximately million related to abandoned real estate in california  net of contractual sublease income 
this net amount has been accrued as a liability as a part of the company s restructuring charge in and subsequently adjusted in and purchase obligations are comprised primarily of outsourced preclinical and clinical trial expenses and payments to license certain intellectual property to support the company s research efforts 
discontinued operations on september   we announced our intention to exit our chemistry services operations 
we received notice on december  that pfizer had elected to terminate our collaboration agreement  pursuant to its terms  effective may  the agreement provided for six months prior written notice by either party to the other for termination without cause and  in the event of termination by pfizer  certain payments to us 
in accordance with these provisions  we received approximately million in december in connection with the termination 
this amount was recorded as deferred revenue and was recognized as revenue when compounds were delivered through the termination date 
we have fulfilled our compound production obligations under the agreement  recognized the remaining deferred revenue  and ceased chemistry services operations in the net book value of the assets associated with the chemistry services operations  which totaled million  approximated the fair market value of the underlying assets 
in december  we completed the sale of the chemistry services assets  which consisted of commercially available laboratory instrumentation  for approximately million  net of disposal costs 
we considered the chemistry services asset group to be a component of an entity as defined in sfas since it comprised operations and cash flows that were clearly distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes  from the remainder of the company s operations 
pursuant to sfas  we reported the results of the chemistry services component as discontinued operations in the year ended december   since their related cash flows were eliminated from our ongoing operations and we do not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component or the assets that were disposed

  historically  arqule entered into various collaborative agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies under which arqule produced and delivered compound arrays and provided research and development services 
revenue elements from collaborative agreements included non refundable technology transfer fees  funding of compound development work  payments based upon delivery of specialized compounds meeting collaborators specific criteria and certain milestones and royalties on product sales 
pfizer notified us in december that  in accordance with the provisions of the collaborative agreement agreement with arqule  it was terminating their collaboration with us effective may  in accordance with the terms of the agreement we received  in december in connection with the termination 
we were required to perform under the terms of the contract during the period from pfizer s termination notification to us through the effective termination date of the contract  and we recognized revenue based on the total number of compounds delivered to pfizer during that time 
as of december   we have completed our compound production obligations under the terms of the agreement and have ceased chemistry services operations 
compound development revenue was derived from the following contractual elements in and in thousands non refundable technology transfer payments funding of compound development payments based on delivery of specialized compounds  milestone payments total compound development revenue   critical accounting policies and estimates a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies 
for additional information  please see the discussion of our significant accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
research and development revenue recognition pursuant to the terms of the roche agreement  roche obtained an option to license arqule s ef program in the field of cancer therapy in roche provided immediate research funding of million  and financial support for ongoing research and development 
arqule is responsible for advancing drug candidates from early stage development into phase trials 
roche may opt to license worldwide rights for the development and commercialization of products resulting from this collaboration by paying an option fee 
assuming the successful development and commercialization of a compound under the program  arqule could receive up to million in pre determined milestone payments  plus royalties based on net sales 
arqule considers the development portion of the arrangement to be a single unit of accounting under eitf for purposes of revenue recognition  and recognizes the initial and ongoing development payments as research and development revenue over the maximum estimated development period 
we estimate the maximum development period could extend until december this period may ultimately be shorter depending upon the outcome of the development work  resulting in accelerated recognition of the development revenue 
milestone and royalty payments will be recognized as revenue when earned 
the cost associated with satisfying the roche contract is included in research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
on april   we entered into an exclusive license agreement with kyowa to develop and commercialize arq  a small molecule  selective inhibitor of the c met receptor tyrosine kinase  in japan and parts of asia 
a million portion of an upfront licensing fee was received by the company under this agreement in the first quarter of and an additional million in upfront licensing fees was received on may  the agreement includes million in upfront and potential development milestone payments from kyowa to arqule  including the million cash upfront licensing payments 
in addition  the agreement includes sales milestone payments 
upon commercialization  arqule will receive double digit royalties from kyowa on net sales of arq kyowa will be responsible for all clinical development costs and commercialization of the compound in certain asian countries  consisting of japan  china including hong kong  south korea and taiwan 
pursuant to the kyowa agreement  the initial license fee and any subsequent milestone payments  once earned  will be recognized as research and development revenue using the contingency adjusted performance model 
under this model  when payments are earned  revenue is immediately recognized on a pro rata basis in the period we achieve the milestone based on the time elapsed from inception of the kyowa agreement to the time the milestone is earned over the estimated duration of the development period under the agreement 
thereafter  the remaining portion of the milestone payment is recognized on a straight line basis over the remaining estimated development period under the agreement 
we currently estimate the development period to be through april this period may ultimately be shorter or longer depending upon the outcome of the development work  resulting in accelerated or deferred recognition of the development revenue 
royalty payments will be recognized as revenue when earned 
the cost associated with satisfying the kyowa contract is included in research and development expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
restructuring charges credits accruals for abandoned facilities under lease require significant management judgment and the use of estimates  including assumptions concerning the ability of a sublessee to fulfill its contractual sublease obligations 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a sublease for the company s abandoned facility in redwood city  california 
the term of the sublease extends through  the remaining term of the company s primary lease 
as a result of signing the sublease  we adjusted our accrual for abandoned facilities to reflect the full amount of the anticipated sublease income to be received 
this assumption about the subleasee s ability to fulfill its contractual obligation is based on an analysis of their financial position and ability to generate future working capital 
if the subleasee is unable to meet its obligations  and the company is unable to enter into another sublease for the facility  arqule may be required to adjust its restructuring accrual and record additional restructuring expense of up to million 
investments in non marketable equity securities at december   we performed an assessment of the fair value of our investment in a privately held proteomics company 
this assessment included analysis of that company s current financial condition  its prospects for generating additional cash flow from operating activities  the current market conditions for raising capital funding for companies in this industry and the likelihood that any funding raised would significantly dilute our ownership percentage 
as a result of this initial analysis  it was our judgment that an impairment had occurred and that the fair value of our investment was million  resulting in a non cash loss on investment of million 
in the second quarter of  events affecting the financial condition of the company caused us to conclude that the fair value of the investment had further declined  and as such  we recorded a non cash loss on investment of million to write off the remaining carrying value of the investment 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets we assess our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances a triggering event indicate that the carrying value of a group of long lived assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas on september   we announced our intention to exit our chemistry services operations when we had completed our existing agreement with pfizer in we concluded that our intention to exit our chemistry services operations was a triggering event and that an impairment review was required 
as a result of that review  we determined that the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from our chemistry services operations exceeded the net carrying value of the group of long lived assets attributed to those operations  and therefore there was no impairment in the quarter ended september  on december   we received notice that pfizer had elected to terminate the agreement  pursuant to the agreement s terms  effective may  we concluded that notification from pfizer was also a triggering event and performed a second impairment review 
as a result of this second review  we again determined that the anticipated undiscounted future cash flows from our chemistry services operations exceeded the net carrying value of the group of long lived assets attributed to those operations  and therefore there was no impairment in the quarter ended december  based on our decision to exit our chemistry services operations  in we adjusted the depreciable lives on fixed assets used exclusively in those operations in order to fully depreciate the remaining book value of those assets over the remaining period that we will provide services to pfizer 
we were contractually required to perform under the terms of the agreement until may  and  as such  the assets of the chemistry services operations were considered held for use at december  although we were actively seeking a potential buyer for the chemistry services operations  the uncertainty of us successfully completing a sale transaction within one year  or deciding to abandon the assets  precluded us from classifying the assets of the chemistry services operations as assets to be disposed of by sale at december  in the third quarter ended september   it became probable that we would sell the chemistry services operations  eliminate the associated cash flows  and have no continuing involvement in the chemistry services operations 
accordingly  the chemistry services operations was reported as discontinued operations in our statements of operations in accordance with sfas the net book value of the assets associated with the chemistry services operations  which totaled million  approximated the fair market value of the underlying assets 
in december  management completed the sale of the chemistry services assets  which consisted of commercially available laboratory instrumentation  for approximately million  net of direct costs to sell such assets 
sale leaseback accounting on may   we completed a transaction to sell our woburn headquarters facility and two parcels of land in exchange for a cash payment of million  net of commissions and closing costs 
simultaneously with that sale  we entered into an agreement to lease back the entire facility and the associated land 
the lease was subsequently amended on june  the amended lease has a term of ten years with an average annual rental rate of million 
we also have options to extend the lease term for up to an additional ten years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases  we are applying sale leaseback accounting to the transaction and are treating the lease as an operating lease 
as a result of this transaction  we reduced our net fixed assets by million  representing the net book value of the assets sold on the date of the lease amendment  and realized a gain on the sale of million  which has been deferred and will be amortized over the initial ten year lease term as a reduction in rent expense 
results of operations the following results of operations for the years ended december   and exclude the effect of discontinued operations revenue increase decrease to to in millions research and development revenue as compared to research and development revenue is comprised of revenue from the roche alliance agreement and from the kyowa exclusive license agreement entered into on april  as compared to research and development revenue which remained the same in both years is comprised of revenue from roche in connection with the alliance agreement 
research and development increase decrease to to in millions research and development overview our research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of facilities and equipment  fees paid to professional service providers in connection with our clinical trials  fees paid to research organizations in connection with preclinical animal studies  costs of materials used in research and development  consulting  license  and sponsored research fees paid to third parties and depreciation of associated laboratory equipment 
we expect our research and development expense to increase as we continue to develop our portfolio of oncology programs 
we have not accumulated and tracked our internal historical research and development costs or our personnel and personnel related costs on a program by program basis 
our employee and infrastructure resources are allocated across several projects  and many of our costs are directed to broadly applicable research endeavors 
as a result  we cannot state the costs incurred for each of our oncology programs on a program by program basis  or the cost to support our alliance agreement with roche 
the expenses incurred by us to third parties for preclinical and clinical trials in and since inception of each program were as follows in thousands oncology program current status program to date ef modulation arq phase   ef modulation arq phase   cmet inhibition arq phase   our future research and development expenses in support of our current and future oncology programs will be subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
we test potential products in numerous preclinical studies for safety  toxicology  and efficacy 
we then may conduct multiple clinical trials for each product 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue or delay clinical trials for certain products in order to focus our resources on more promising products 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty  and intended use of a product 
it is not unusual for the preclinical and clinical development of these types of products to each take nine years or more  and for total development costs to exceed million for each product 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type generally needed to secure new drug approval are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase years phase years phase years the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical development  including  among others  the following the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects  the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials  the duration of patient follow up to ensure the absence of long term adverse safety events  and the efficacy and safety profile of the product 
an element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a broad pipeline of products 
this is intended to allow us to diversify the risks associated with our research and development expenditures 
as a result  we believe our future capital requirements and future financial success are not substantially dependent on any one product 
to the extent we are unable to maintain a broad pipeline of products  our dependence on the success of one or a few products increases 
our strategy includes entering into alliance arrangements with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of our products  such as our collaboration agreements with roche and kyowa 
in the event that third parties have control over the clinical trial process for a product  the estimated completion date would largely be under control of that third party rather than under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether our products will be subject to future collaborative arrangements or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of our oncology programs or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product 
our inability to complete our oncology programs in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
as compared to the million increase in research and development expense in is primarily due to i a million increase in outsourced costs related to the phase and clinical programs for arq  ii an increase of million in connection with the company s sponsored research agreement with boston biomedical institute bbi  and iii a decrease of million in outsourced costs related to the phase and clinical programs with arq at december   we had employees dedicated to our research and development program  down from employees at december  as compared to the million increase in research and development expense in is primarily due to i an increase in outsourced preclinical  clinical and manufacturing costs of million required to advance our oncology programs  principally arq  arq and arq  ii an increase in personnel and related costs of million reflecting the hiring of additional scientists and stock based compensation charges recorded in but not  iii increased professional fees of million and iv increased facility and maintenance costs of million  due to the absorption of these costs  formerly associated with the chemical services operations  by our research and development organization 
at december   we had employees dedicated to our research and development program  up from employees at december  general and administrative increase decrease to to in millions general and administrative compared to general and administrative expense increased million in primarily due to increased personnel related costs of million  including stock based compensation expense of million and million of facility costs which are no longer absorbed by the chemical services operations 
general and administrative headcount was at december   compared to at december  compared to general and administrative expense increased million in primarily due to increased personnel related expenses  including stock based compensation expense of million  and due to facility costs of million which are no longer absorbed by the chemical services operations 
restructuring in december  we announced a major restructuring of our operations in order to realign our workforce and expedite the transition towards becoming a drug discovery company 
the restructuring actions included closing our facilities in redwood city  california and cambridge  united kingdom 
the facility related accrual  which represents the difference between our lease obligation for the california facility and the amount of sublease payments it will receive under its sublease agreement  will be paid out through on january   our board of directors authorized termination benefits for employees in connection with a plan of termination for our discontinued chemistry services operations 
the termination benefits  which affected employees  consisted of cash payments and continuation of health care benefits 
in  a restructuring charge of million was recorded pursuant to this action and is included in the consolidated statement of operations as part of income from discontinued operations 
as of december   all affected employees had been separated from the company and the restructuring costs were fully paid 
activities against the restructuring accrual in and were as follows in thousands balance as of december  provisions payments balance as of december  termination benefits discontinued operations   other charges discontinued operations facility related   total restructuring accrual     balance as of december  provisions payments balance as of december  facility related   total restructuring accrual   investment income and interest expense increase decrease to to in millions investment income interest expense investment income  net investment income is derived from our portfolio of cash and short term investments 
investment income increased year to year due to the increased average portfolio balance and to generally higher interest rates

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this accounting standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of sfas is not anticipated to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas  which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before november   provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
it also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
the implementation of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in june  the emerging issues task force eitf  reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
eitf concludes that non refundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized until the goods have been delivered or the related services have been performed 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
this consensus is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the initial adjustment to reflect the effect of applying the consensus as a change in accounting principle would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption 
we do not believe that our adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk as part of our investment portfolio 
we have implemented policies regarding the amount and credit ratings of investments 
our investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is used to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
our investments are evaluated quarterly to determine the fair value of the portfolio 
our cash and marketable securities include money market funds  corporate bonds and us federal and state agency backed certificates  including auction rate securities and other investment grade debt securities that have strong credit ratings 
our cash equivalents and our portfolio of marketable securities are subject to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
fixed rate interest securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectation due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in the market value due to changes in interest rates 
auction rate securities are securities that are structured with short term interest rate reset dates of generally less than ninety days but with contractual maturities that can be well in excess of ten years 
at the end of each reset period  which occurs every seven to twenty eight days  investors can sell or continue to hold the securities at par 
these securities are subject to fluctuations in fair value depending on the supply and demand at each auction 
in the first quarter of  certain auction rate securities failed auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
we will review our portfolio at the end of the quarter ending march   taking into consideration other than temporary impairment factors  to conclude whether arqule has an impairment
