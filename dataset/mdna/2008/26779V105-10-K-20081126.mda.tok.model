item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our management s discussion and analysis includes forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from the statements we make in this section due to a number of factors that are discussed in item a risk factors 
our operating results for all periods presented reflect our baton rouge and west houston facilities as discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to the management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes these accounting policies involve judgment due to the significant assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related asset and liability amounts 
management believes it has exercised proper judgment in determining these estimates based on the facts and circumstances available to its management at the time the estimates were made 
the significant accounting policies are described in the company s financial statements see note in notes to the consolidated financial statements 
of these policies  management believes the following ones may involve a comparatively higher degree of judgment and complexity 
we have discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition background the company s revenue recognition policy is significant because net patient service revenue is a primary component of its results of operations 
revenue is recognized as services are delivered 
the determination of the 
table of contents amount of revenue to recognize in connection with the company s services is subject to significant judgments and estimates  which are discussed below 
revenue recognition policy the company has established billing rates for its medical services which it bills as gross revenue as services are delivered 
gross billed revenues are then reduced by the company s estimate of the discount contractual allowance to arrive at net patient service revenues 
net patient service revenues are based on estimated or historical cash collections as discussed below and may not represent amounts ultimately collected 
at such time as the company can determine that ultimate collections have exceeded or have been less than the revenue recorded on a group of accounts  additional revenue or reduction in revenue is recorded as a change in estimate during the current period 
the company does adjust current period revenue for actual differences in estimated revenue recorded in prior periods and actual cash collections 
as the company is able to identify specific closed blocks of business  the company compares the actual cash collections on gross billed charges to the estimated collections that were recorded in revenue 
the company records additional revenue or a reduction in revenue in the current period equal to the difference in the estimate recorded and the actual cash collected 
in the last two fiscal years  the company has recorded additional revenue as follows the company has recorded additional revenue of  during the fiscal year ended august  related to amounts collected on mdr accounts receivable 
the company settled various mdr claims for our pasadena and garland facilities and collected a total of  for dates of service ranging from to this amount represents payments received initially at the time of filing of the claim  additional monies received upon filing the mdr claim and the settlement amount 
on these closed mdr accounts receivable  the company had recognized approximately  as net revenue during the relevant fiscal years when the service was performed 
gross billings on this block of receivables were  since the company actually collected  more on this block of receivables than was booked  additional revenue of    and  was recorded in the first  second  third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year ended august   respectively 
we do not believe that the amount of additional revenues from mdr settlements reached in this fiscal year is indicative of the amounts that will be obtained from settlements reached in the next twelve months  since insurance companies who have not yet settled may be more likely to appeal their cases  which could delay settlement or a final judgment 
the company collected  on a block of business generated at our garland facility between september and february the accounts included in this block of business were not related to workers compensation 
gross billings on this block of receivables were  the contractual allowance booked on this block of receivables was  or approximately  generating net revenue of  since the company actually collected  more than revenue booked on this block of receivables  additional revenue in the amount of  was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended august  the company collected  on a block of business generated at our pasadena facility between september and february the accounts included in this block of business were not related to workers compensation 
gross billings on this block of receivables were  the contractual allowance booked on this block of receivables was  or approximately  generating net revenue of  since the company actually collected  more than revenue booked on this block of receivables  additional revenue in the amount of  was recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended august  due to the uncertainties regarding the accounts receivable in the mdr process  the recent third court of appeals opinion and outside counsel s advice that settlements with insurance carriers have virtually stopped  the company has fully reserved all accounts receivable related to the mdr process as of august   and written off million and million of mdr accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended august   at our garland and pasadena facilities  respectively 
the net write down in net patient service revenue was million in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended august   or million net of income tax expense  or per diluted share 

table of contents the table below sets forth the percentage of our gross patient service revenue by financial class for the fiscal years and workers compensation commercial medicare medicaid self pay other contractual allowance starting march   the company computes its contractual allowance based on the estimated collections on its gross billed charges 
the company computes its estimate by taking into account collections received for the services performed and also estimating amounts collectible within the next six months and after six months by considering historical collections ratio 
prior to march   the contractual allowance was calculated based on the ratio of the company s historical cash collections during the trailing twelve months on a case by case basis by operating facility 
this ratio of cash collections to billed services was then applied to the gross billed services by operating facility 
the following table shows gross revenues and contractual allowances for fiscal years and gross billed charges contractual allowance net revenue contractual allowance percentage a significant amount of our net revenue results from texas workers compensation claims  which are governed by the rules and regulations of the tdwc and the workers compensation healthcare networks 
if one of our hospitals chooses to participate in a network  the amount of revenue that will be generated from workers compensation claims will be governed by the network contract 
for claims arising prior to the implementation of workers compensation networks and out of network claims  inpatient and outpatient surgical services are either reimbursed pursuant to the acute care in patient hospital fee guideline or at a fair and reasonable rate for services in which the fee guideline is not applicable 
starting march   the guidelines became effective 
under these guidelines  the reimbursement amounts are determined by applying the most recently adopted and effective medicare reimbursement formula and factors  however  if the maximum allowable reimbursement for the procedure performed cannot be calculated using these guidelines  then reimbursement is determined on a fair and reasonable basis 
based on these new guidelines  the reimbursement due the company for workers compensation cases is lower than we previously experienced 
the company has continued accepting texas workers compensation cases  and has not made any substantial changes in its focus towards such cases 
our net patient service revenue for texas workers compensation cases as a percentage of gross billings has decreased primarily as a result of lower reimbursement rates for workers compensation procedures still being performed 
should our facility disagree with the amount of reimbursement provided by a third party payer  we are required to pursue the mdr process at the tdwc to request proper reimbursement for services 
the company has recently been successful in its pursuit of collections regarding the stop loss cases pending before soah  receiving positive rulings in over of its claims presented for administrative determination 
the district court decision upholding our interpretation of the statute as applied to the stop loss claims was recently appealed by certain insurance carriers  and the third court of appeals determined that in order for a hospital to be reimbursed at of its usual and customary audited charges for an inpatient admission  the hospital must not only bill at least  but also show that the admission involved unusually costly and unusually extensive services 
procedurally  the 
table of contents decision means that each case where a carrier raised an issue regarding whether the services provided were unusually costly or unusually extensive would be remanded to either soah or mdr for a case by case determination of whether the services provided meet these standards  once the definitions of those standards are determined 
we plan to appeal the third court of appeals decision and anticipate further  lengthy litigation at the travis county district courts and the texas courts of appeals to establish the legal definition for these standards 
because of this lengthy process and the uncertainty of recovery in these cases  collection of a material amount of funds in these pending stop loss cases is not anticipated during the fiscal year 
to date  insurance carriers have voluntarily paid the awards in the decisions and orders issued by soah  plus interest  in approximately cases  involving approximately million 
in most of these cases  the carriers have requested refunds of the payments made in the event that the soah decisions and orders are reversed on appeal 
we believe the company s ultimate obligation to refund the payments is remote 
our request that the tdwc commissioner enforce the awards which have not been voluntarily paid by the carriers has been refused in approximately cases 
claims regarding payment for hospital outpatient services remain pending at the tdwc 
it is expected that these claims will be adjudicated at soah and ultimately in the texas district and appellate courts 
the basis for reimbursement for these services made the subject of these pending cases is the determination of fair and reasonable charges 
in  we received unfavorable rulings from soah in all of our appeals of unfavorable decisions related to services provided in and the cases which have been appealed to the travis county district courts challenge the constitutionality of the relevant statutory language 
a lead case has been selected and is scheduled to be heard on january  although we would appeal any negative ruling handed down in this lead case  such ruling will impact cases in which a fee guideline was not applicable  specifically all pending cases involving ambulatory surgical services provided in and as well as all pending cases involving hospital outpatient services provided prior to march  successful collection of material amounts in these cases is unlikely 
we are currently pursuing claims against two healthcare agents relating to contracts with certain of our facilities which set out reimbursement guidelines by several workers compensation carriers at a minimum of of the facility s charges 
discovery is continuing on these claims to determine which carriers are involved and the amount of reimbursement due to us 
due to the uncertainties regarding the accounts receivable in the mdr process  the recent third court of appeals opinion and our legal counsel s advice that settlements with insurance carriers have virtually stopped  the company has fully reserved all accounts receivable related to the mdr process as of august  any monies collected for these mdr accounts receivable will be recorded as current period s net patient service revenues 
accounts receivable accounts receivable represent net receivables for services provided by the company 
due to reasons discussed above for writing down all mdr accounts receivable  the company does not have any long term receivables as at august   and expects to collect the net receivables within twelve months 
at each balance sheet date management reviews the accounts receivable for collectibility 
the contractual allowance stated as a percentage of gross receivables at the balance sheet dates is larger than the contractual allowance percentage used to reduce gross billed charges due to the application of partial cash collections to the outstanding gross receivable balances  without any adjustment being made to the contractual allowance 
the contractual allowance amounts netted against gross receivables are not adjusted until such time as the final collections on an individual receivable are recognized 
sources of revenue and reimbursement the focal point of our business is providing patient care services  including complex orthopedic and bariatric procedures 
the company pursues optimal reimbursement from third party payers for these services 
we do not normally participate in managed care or other contractual reimbursement agreements  principally because they limit reimbursement for the medical services provided 
this business model often results in increased amounts of 
table of contents reimbursement for the same or similar procedure  as compared to other healthcare providers 
however  there are no contractual or administrative requirements for prompt payment of claims by third party payers within a specified time frame 
as a result  the company has tended to receive higher amounts of per procedure reimbursement than that which may be received by other healthcare providers performing similar services 
conversely  despite the increased reimbursement  we may take additional time to collect the expected reimbursement from third party payers 
the company has been participating in managed care contracts since the first quarter of fiscal and anticipates entering into additional contracts in the future 
so far these contracts have not resulted in any meaningful patient revenues 
increased participation in managed care contracts and programs may decrease the per procedure reimbursement that the company collects in the future for similar services 
in addition to the fact that our collection process may be longer than other healthcare providers because of our focus on workers compensation and other commercial payers  the collection process can be extended due to our efforts to obtain all optimal reimbursement available to the company 
specifically  for medical services provided to injured workers  the company may initially receive reimbursement that may not be within the fee guidelines or regulatory guidelines mandating reimbursement 
for such cases in which third party payers did not provide appropriate reimbursement pursuant to these guidelines  the company pursues further reimbursement 
the company reviews and pursues those particular claims that are determined to warrant additional reimbursement pursuant to the fee or regulatory guidelines 
the company s pursuit of additional reimbursement amounts that it believes are due under fee or regulatory guidelines may be accomplished through established dispute resolution procedures with applicable regulatory authorities 
surgeries are typically not scheduled unless they are pre authorized by the insurance carrier for medical necessity  with the exception of medicare  medicaid and self pay surgeries 
after the surgery  the company s automated computer system generates a statement of billed charges to the third party payer 
at that time  the company also requests payment from patients for any remaining amounts that are the responsibility of the patient 
in cases where a commercial insurance payers pre approval is not approved subsequently  those accounts receivable may be classified to self pay 
historically  such classifications have not been significant 
income taxes sfas  accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted rates in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income 
valuation allowances are established for the deferred tax assets that we believe do not meet the more likely than not criteria established by sfas no 
judgments regarding future taxable income may be revised due to changes in market conditions  tax laws  or other factors 
if our assumptions and estimates change in the future  then the valuation allowances established may be increased  resulting in increased income tax expense 
conversely  if we are ultimately able to use all or a portion of the deferred tax assets for which a valuation allowance has been established  then the related portion of the valuation allowance will be released to income as a credit to income tax expense 
income tax expense is the tax payable for the period and the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
stock based compensation effective at the beginning of our fiscal year  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
share based payment sfas no 
r to account for stock based compensation 
under sfas no 
r  we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term 
the amount of expense attributed is based on an estimated forfeiture rate  which is updated as appropriate 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our common stock  pre 
table of contents vesting forfeiture rate and an option s expected life 
the financial statements include amounts that are based on our best estimates and judgments

table of contents comparison of the fiscal years ended august  and august  since the china division has had no revenues in fiscal years ended august  and  all net patient service revenue of the company for these years is from the us division 
the china division incurred costs and expenses during these years  which are discussed below 
net patient service revenue increased by  or  from  to  and total surgical cases increased by from  cases in fiscal year to  cases in fiscal year following are the percentage changes in net patient service revenues and number of cases at the hospital facilities percentage increase from to facility net patient revenue cases pasadena garland overall the increase in net patient service revenues is due to following reasons increase in bariatric and orthopedic cases at garland and pasadena facilities the garland facility had an increase in both bariatric and orthopedic cases due to recruitment of additional physicians in previous years 
the increase in net patient service revenue is primarily due to an increase in overall number of cases and also due to a increase in number of inpatient cases at our garland facility  which typically have a higher average reimbursement per case 
due to recruitment of additional physicians at our pasadena facility  we had an increase primarily in bariatric cases  as well as in orthopedic cases 
the utilization rate of our hospitals varies widely among physicians on our medical staffs and among specializations  so an increase in the number of physicians on our medical staffs does not  in itself  result in an increase in patient referrals or revenues 
while we attempt to continue to attract and retain additional physicians  the potential loss of physicians who provide significant net patient revenues for the company may adversely affect our results of operations 
increase in average net patient service revenue per case even though the number of cases increased overall in compared to  the net patient service revenue increased by 
backing out the additional revenues booked discussed above  the net patient service revenue increased  due to an increase of cases by coupled with an increase of in average net patient service revenue per case 
excluding the above mentioned additional revenues  net patient service revenue per case increased by  or  from  in to  in starting march   the company estimates the contractual allowance for texas workers compensation cases based on the new fee guidelines  and for the other cases based on management s estimate of collection percentage of gross billed charges 
the historical collection for non texas workers compensation cases is primarily used as a guideline to estimate contractual allowance 
prior to march   the contractual allowance was calculated based on the ratio of the company s historical cash collections during the trailing twelve months on a case by case basis by operating facility 
in compliance with this revenue recognition policy  the company s contractual allowance as a percentage of gross patient revenue increased from in to in 
table of contents net reduction in revenues due to closed books of business and write off of mdr accounts receivable in terms of the company s revenue recognition policy  net patient service revenues are based on estimated or historical cash collections and may not represent amounts ultimately collected 
at such time as the company determines that ultimate collections have exceeded the revenue recorded on a group of accounts  additional revenue or reduction in revenue is recorded as a change in estimate during the current period 
the company analyzed various blocks of business for mdrs and commercial payers  for both the garland and pasadena facilities  and recognized additional revenues of approximately million and million  respectively  for amounts collected in excess of revenue recognized in prior years 
due to the uncertainties regarding the accounts receivable in the mdr process  the recent third court of appeals opinion and our legal counsel s advice that settlements with insurance carriers have virtually stopped  the company has fully reserved all accounts receivable related to the mdr process as of august   and written off million and million of mdr accounts receivable in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended august   at our garland and pasadena facilities  respectively 
total costs and expenses increased by  or  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the following describes the various changes in costs and expenses compensation and benefits increased by  or 
during fiscal year  the company incurred a  non cash pre tax compensation expense primarily related to employees incentive stock options granted in fiscal year excluding this non cash compensation expense  the increase in compensation and benefits in the current fiscal year is compared to the prior fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in number of cases  and also due to annual cash incentive bonuses paid to employees 
during and  the china division operations were handled by contract employees  and payments to them are included in other operating expenses 
medical services and supplies expenses increased  or  while the number of surgery cases increased 
the increase was primarily due to a increase in the number of inpatient procedures  which typically require more medical services and supplies 
medical services and supplies were consistent at and of gross billed charges for fiscal year and  respectively 
since the china division had no revenues for fiscal years and  there were no medical services and supplies expenses there 
other operating expenses increased by  or 
us division other operating expenses for the us division increased by  or  from  in to  in even though the net patient service revenue increased by  the marginal increase in other operating expenses is due to continued efforts made by the company to reduce costs and expenses

dynacq is seeking to expand its operations into china to achieve 
table of contents geographic diversity and take advantage of a high growth market in the provision of healthcare services in that country 
the management arrangement will allow dynacq to minimize its expenditure of capital to purchase assets  but still have the potential for an attractive return in its efficient management of the hospital facility
