part i item business overview we operate the only global commercial wireless messaging system optimized for narrowband communications 
our system consists of a global network of low earth orbit  or leo  satellites and accompanying ground infrastructure 
our two way communications system enables our customers and end users  which include large and established multinational businesses and government agencies  to track  monitor  control and communicate cost effectively with fixed and mobile assets located anywhere in the world 
in  we began providing terrestrial based cellular communication services through a re seller agreement with a major cellular wireless provider 
these services commenced in the third quarter of and revenues from such services were not significant in in addition  a re seller agreement was signed with a second major cellular wireless provider in the fourth quarter of and services with this provider are expected to commence in the first half of these terrestrial based communication services enable our customers who have higher bandwidth requirements to receive and send messages from communication devices based on terrestrial based technologies using the cellular provider s wireless network as well as from dual mode devices combining our satellite subscriber communicators with devices for terrestrial based technologies 
as a result  our customers are now able to integrate into their applications a terrestrial communications device that will allow them to add messages  including data intensive messaging from the cellular provider s wireless network 
our products and services enable our customers and end users to enhance productivity  reduce costs and improve security through a variety of commercial  government and emerging homeland security applications 
we enable our customers and end users to achieve these benefits using a single global technology standard for machine 
table of contents to machine and telematic  or mm  data communications 
our customers have made significant investments in developing orbcomm based applications 
examples of assets that are connected through our mm data communications system include trucks  trailers  railcars  containers  heavy equipment  fluid tanks  utility meters  and pipeline monitoring equipment  marine vessels and oil wells 
our customers include original equipment manufacturers  or oems  such as caterpillar inc  komatsu ltd  hitachi construction machinery co  ltd 
and the volvo group  ivars  such as ge  vars  such as fleet management services  xata corporation and american innovations  ltd  and government agencies  such as the us coast guard 
through our mm data communications system  our customers and end users can send and receive information to and from any place in the world using low cost subscriber communicators and paying airtime costs that we believe are the lowest in the industry for global connectivity 
our customers can also use cellular wireless subscriber identity modules  or sims  for use with devices or equipment that enable the use of a cellular provider s wireless network  singularly or in conjunction with satellite services  to send and receive information from these devices 
we believe that there is no other satellite or terrestrial network currently in operation that can offer global two way wireless narrowband data service including coverage at comparable cost using a single technology standard worldwide  that also provides a parallel terrestrial network for data intensive applications 
we are currently authorized  either directly or indirectly  to provide our communications services in over countries and territories in north america  europe  south america  asia  africa and australia 
our unique mm data communications system is comprised of three elements i a constellation of leo satellites in multiple orbital planes between and miles above the earth operating in the very high frequency  or vhf  radio frequency spectrum  ii a network of related ground infrastructure  including gateway earth stations  four regional gateway control centers and a network control center in dulles  virginia  through which data sent to and from subscriber communicators are routed  and iii a combination of subscriber communicators and cellular wireless sims attached to a variety of fixed and mobile assets worldwide 
see the orbcomm communications system 
in the second quarter of  we revised our definition of billable subscriber communicators to mean subscriber communicators  including terrestrial units for our terrestrial communication services that are shipped and activated for usage and billing at the request of the customer  without forecasting a timeframe for when individual units will be generating usage and be billing 
in the past  we reported billable subscriber communicators defined as subscriber communicators activated and currently billing or expected to be billing within to days 
under the revised definition of billable subscribers described above  as of december   we had approximately  billable subscriber communicators activated on our communications system compared to approximately  billable subscriber communicators as of december   an increase of approximately 
we believe that our target markets in commercial transportation  heavy equipment  fixed asset monitoring  marine vessel  consumer transportation  and government and homeland security markets are significant and growing 
our business strengths and competitive advantage we believe that our focus on mm data communications is unique in our industry and will enable us to achieve significant growth 
we believe no other satellite or terrestrial network currently in operation offers users global two way wireless narrowband data communications using a single global technology standard anywhere in the world at costs comparable to ours 
this provides us with a number of competitive advantages that we believe will help promote our success  including the following established global satellite network and proven technology 
we believe our global satellite network and technology enable us to offer superior products and services to the end users of our communications system in terms of comprehensive coverage  reliability and compatibility 
our global satellite network provides worldwide coverage  including in international waters  allowing end users to access our communications system in areas outside the coverage of terrestrial networks  such as cellular  paging and other wireless networks 
our proven technology offers full two way mm data communication with acknowledgement of message receipt with minimal line of sight limitations and no performance issues during adverse weather conditions  which distinguishes us from other satellite communications systems 
our primary satellite 
table of contents orbital planes contain six to eight satellites each providing built in system redundancies in the event of a single satellite malfunction 
in addition  our satellite system uses a single global technology standard and eliminates the need for multiple network agreements and versions of hardware and software 
low cost structure 
we have a significant cost advantage over any potential new leo satellite system competitor with respect to our current satellite constellation  because we acquired the majority of our current network assets from orbcomm global lp  referred to as the predecessor company  and its subsidiaries out of bankruptcy for a fraction of their original cost 
in addition  because our leo satellites are relatively small and deployed into low earth orbit  the constellation is less expensive and easier to launch and maintain than larger leo satellites and large geostationary satellites 
we believe that we have less complex and less costly ground infrastructure and subscriber communication equipment than other satellite communications providers 
our low cost satellite system architecture enables us to provide global two way wireless narrowband data communication services to end users at prices that we believe are the lowest in the industry for global connectivity 
sole commercial satellite operator licensed in the vhf spectrum 
we are the sole commercial satellite operator licensed to operate in the mhz vhf spectrum by the fcc or  to our knowledge  any other national spectrum or radio telecommunications regulatory agency in the world 
the spectrum that we use was allocated globally by the international telecommunication union  or itu  for use by satellite fleets such as ours to provide mobile data communications service 
we are currently authorized  either directly or indirectly  to provide our data communications service in over countries and territories  representing over of the world s gdp  in north america  europe  south america  asia  africa and australia 
vhf spectrum has inherent advantages for mm data communications over systems using shorter wavelength signals 
the vhf signals used to communicate between our satellites and subscriber communicators are not affected by weather and are less dependent on line of sight access to our satellites than other satellite communications systems 
in addition  our longer wavelength signals enable our satellites to communicate reliably over longer distances at lower power levels 
higher power requirements of commercial satellite systems in other spectrum bands are a significant factor in their higher cost and technical complexity 
significant market lead over satellite based competitors 
we believe that we have a significant market lead in providing mm data communications services that meet the coverage and cost requirements in the rapidly developing asset management and supply chain markets 
the process required to establish a new competing satellite based system with the advantages of a vhf system includes obtaining regulatory permits to launch and operate satellites and to provide communications services  and the design  development and construction of a communications system 
we believe that a minimum of five years and significant investments in time and resources would be required for another satellite based mm data communications service provider to develop the capability to offer comparable services 
our vars and ivars have made significant investments in developing orbcomm based applications 
these applications often require substantial time and financial investment to develop for commercial use 
key distribution and oem customer relationships 
our strategic relationships with key distributors and oems have enabled us to streamline our sales and distribution channels and shift much of the risk and cost of developing and marketing applications to others 
we have established strategic relationships with key service providers  such as ge equipment services  the world s largest lessor of trailers  containers and railcars  and xata corporation  a leading provider of tracking solutions for the trucking industry  including to penske corporation  the leading truck leasing company in the united states  and major oems  such as caterpillar  komatsu  hitachi and volvo 
we believe our close relationships with these distributors and oems allows us to work closely with them at all stages of application development  from planning and design through implementation of our mm data communications services  and to benefit from their industry specific expertise 
by fostering these strong relationships with distributors and oems  we believe that once we have become so integrated into our customer s planning  development and implementation process  and their equipment  we anticipate it will be more difficult to displace us or our communication services 
in addition  the fixed and mobile assets which are tracked  monitored  controlled and communicated with by these customers generally have long useful lives and the cost of replacing our communications equipment with an alternative service provider s equipment could be prohibitive for large numbers of assets 

table of contents reliable  low cost subscriber communicators 
there are multiple manufacturers that build subscriber communicators for our network 
through our stellar satellite communications  ltd 
subsidiary  we have an arrangement with delphi corporation that provides us with industrial scale manufacturing capability for the supply of low cost  reliable  iso certified  automotive grade subscriber communicators 
we believe that delphi possesses the ability to scale up its manufacturing rapidly to meet additional demand 
we also have arrangements with independent third party manufacturers who supply our customers and end users directly with low cost subscriber communicators 
as a result of these manufacturing relationships  technological advances and higher volumes  we have significantly reduced the selling price of our subscriber communicators from approximately per unit in to as little as per unit in volume in in addition  the cost of communications components necessary for our subscriber communicators to operate in the vhf band is relatively low as they are based on readily available fm radio components 
our strategy our strategy is to leverage our business strengths and key competitive advantages to increase the number of subscriber communicators activated on our mm data communications system  both in existing and new markets 
we are focused on increasing our market share of customers with the potential for a high number of connections with lower usage applications 
we believe that the service revenue associated with each additional subscriber communicator activated on our communications system will more than offset the negligible incremental cost of adding such subscriber communicator to our system and  as a result  positively impact our results of operations 
we plan to continue to target multinational companies and government agencies to increase substantially our penetration of what we believe is a significant and growing addressable market 
to achieve our objectives  we are pursuing the following business strategies expand our low cost  multi channel marketing and distribution network of resellers 
we intend to increase further the number of resellers that develop  market and implement their applications together with our communications services and subscriber communicators to end users 
we are also focused on increasing the number of oem and distributor relationships with leading companies that own  manage or operate fixed or mobile assets 
we are seeking to recruit resellers with industry knowledge to develop applications that could be used for industries or markets that we do not currently serve 
resellers invest their own capital developing applications compatible with our system  and they typically act as their own agents and systems integrators when marketing these applications to end users  without the need for significant investment by us 
as a result  we have established a low cost marketing and distribution model that is both easily scalable by adding additional resellers or large scale asset deployers  and allows us to penetrate markets without incurring substantial research and development costs or sales and marketing costs 
expand our international markets 
our international growth strategy is to open new markets outside the united states by obtaining regulatory authorizations and developing markets for our mm data communications services to be sold in regions where the market opportunity for our oem customers and resellers is greatest 
we are currently authorized to provide our data communications services in over countries and territories in north america  europe  south america  asia  africa  mexico and australia  directly or indirectly through seven international licensees and country representatives 
we are currently working with approximately ivars who  generally  subject to certain regulatory restrictions  have the right to market and sell their applications anywhere our communications services are offered 
we seek to enter into agreements with strong distributors in each region 
our regional distributors  which include country representatives and international licensees  obtain the necessary regulatory authorizations and develop local markets directly or by recruiting local vars 
in some international markets where distribution channels are in the early stages of development  we seek to bring together vars who have developed well tested applications with local distributors to create localized solutions and accelerate the adoption of our mm data communications services 
in addition  we have made efforts to strengthen the financial positions of certain of our regional distributors  including several  such as orbcomm europe llc  who were former licensees of the predecessor company left weakened by its bankruptcy  through restructuring transactions whereby we obtained greater operating control over such regional distributors 
we believe that by strengthening the financial condition of and our operating control over these established regional 
table of contents distributors  they will be better positioned to promote and distribute our products and services and enable us to achieve our market potential in the relevant regions 
further reduce subscriber communicator costs 
we are working with our subscriber communicator manufacturers to further reduce the cost of our subscriber communicators  as well as to develop technological advances  including further reductions in size  improvements in power management efficiency  increased reliability and enhanced capabilities 
for example  our subscriber communicator supplier delphi  and independent supplier mobile applitech  inc  are developing next generation subscriber communicators which will contain custom integrated circuits combining the functionality of several components  which we believe will lead to reduced costs 
our ability to offer our customers less expensive subscriber communicators that are smaller  more efficient and more reliable is key to our ability to provide a complete low cost solution to our customers and end users 
reduce network latency 
with the expected launch of our quick launch and next generation satellites  we expect to reduce the time lags in delivering messages and data  or network latency  in most regions of the world 
we believe this will improve the quality and coverage of our system and enable us to increase our customer base 
introduce new features and services 
we will continue to develop and introduce new features and services to expand our customer base and increase our revenues 
for example  as a result of providing terrestrial based cellular communication services  our customers are now able to able to integrate in their applications a terrestrial communications device that will allow them to add messages  including data intensive messaging from combined satellite and cellular technologies 
we have upgraded the technology capabilities of our network operations center to deliver both satellite and terrestrial messages through our ground infrastructure to the ultimate destination 
in addition  we have recently developed a broadcast capability that allows large numbers of subscriber communicators to receive a single message simultaneously 
this represents an efficient delivery mechanism to address large populations of subscribers with a single message  such as weather data broadcasts  widespread alert notifications and demand response applications for electric utilities 
in addition  we have been working closely with the us coast guard to incorporate the ability to receive marine vessel identification and position data from the automatic identification system  or ais  an internationally mandated shipboard broadcast system that aids navigation and improves maritime safety 
we may be able to leverage this work with ais to resell  subject in certain circumstances to us coast guard approval  ais data collected by our network to other coast guard services and governmental agencies  as well as companies engaged in security or logistics businesses for tracking shipping activities or for other navigational purposes 
we believe that subscriber communicator technology advances  such as dual mode devices  will broaden our addressable market by providing optimal combinations of bandwidth and coverage at a reasonable price 
dual mode devices combine a satellite subscriber communicator with a cellular network subscriber communicator for higher bandwidth applications not typical of orbcomm s applications 
dual mode devices can also be used as a back channel service for terrestrial or satellite based broadcast only networks 
provide comprehensive technical support  customer service and quality control 
we have allocated additional resources to provide customer support for training  integration and testing in order to assist our vars and other distributors in the roll out of their applications and to enhance end user acquisition and retention 
we provide our var and oem customers with access to customer support technicians 
we also deploy our technicians to our var and oem customers to facilitate the integration of our mm data communications system with their applications during the planning  development and implementation processes and to certify that these applications are compatible with our system 
our support personnel include professionals with application development  in house laboratory and hardware design and testing capabilities 
industry overview increasingly  businesses and governments face the need to track  control  and monitor and communicate with fixed and mobile assets that are located throughout the world 
at the same time  these assets increasingly 
table of contents incorporate microprocessors  sensors and other devices that can provide a variety of information about the asset s location  condition  operation and environment and are capable of responding to external commands and queries 
as these intelligent devices proliferate  we believe that the need to establish two way communications with these devices is greater than ever 
the owners and operators of these intelligent devices are seeking low cost and efficient communications systems that will enable them to communicate with these devices 
we operate in the machine to machine and telematics  or mm  industry  which includes various types of communications systems that enable intelligent machines  devices and fixed or mobile assets to communicate information from the machine  device or fixed or mobile asset to and from back office information systems of the businesses and government agencies that track  monitor  control and communicate with them 
these mm data communications systems integrate a number of technologies and cross several different industries  including computer hardware and software systems  positioning systems  terrestrial and satellite communications networks and information technologies such as data hosting and report generation 
there are three main components in any mm data communications system fixed or mobile assets 
intelligent or trackable assets include devices and sensors that collect  measure  record or otherwise gather data about themselves or their environment to be used  analyzed or otherwise disseminated to other machines  applications or human operators and come in many forms  including devices and sensors that report the location  speed and fuel economy data from trucks and locomotives  monitor the location and condition of trailers  railcars and marine shipping containers  report operating data and usage for heavy equipment  monitor fishing vessels to enforce government regulations regarding geographic and seasonal restrictions  report energy consumption from a utility meter  monitor corrosion in a pipeline  monitor fluid levels in oil storage tanks  measure water delivery in agricultural pipelines  detect movement along international borders  and monitor environmental conditions in agricultural facilities 
communications network 
the communications network enables a connection to take place between the fixed or mobile asset and the back office systems and users of that asset s data 
the proliferation of terrestrial and satellite based wireless networks has enabled the creation of a variety of mm data communications applications 
networks that are being used to deliver mm data include terrestrial communications networks  such as cellular  radio paging and wifi networks  and satellite communications networks  utilizing low earth orbit or geosynchronous satellites 
back office application or user 
data collected from a remote asset is used in a variety of ways with applications that allow the end user to track  monitor  control and communicate with these assets with a greater degree of control and with much less time and expense than would be required to do so manually 
market opportunity commercial transportation large trucking and trailer leasing companies require applications that report location  engine diagnostic data  driver performance  fuel consumption  compliance  rapid decelerations  fuel taxes  driver logs and zone adherence in order to manage their truck fleets more safely and efficiently and to improve truck and trailer utilization 
truck and trailer fleet owners and operators  as well as truck and trailer oems  are increasingly integrating mm data communications systems into their trucks and trailers 
as older analog cellular wireless networks 
table of contents currently used in truck and trailer tracking are phased out  end users will need to migrate to alternative communications systems and we expect that an increasing number of customers will be seeking long term solutions for their mm data communications needs as they make their replacement decisions 
trailer tracking represents a significantly larger potential market as we estimate that there are approximately three trailers to every truck 
the trailer market also requires additional applications  such as cargo sensor reporting  load monitoring  control of refrigeration systems and door alarms 
future regulations may require position tracking of specific types of cargo  such as hazardous materials  and could also increase trailer tracking market opportunities 
the railcar market also requires many of these same applications and many trailer applications using mm data communications system can easily be translated to the railcar market 
heavy equipment heavy equipment fleet owners and leasing companies seeking to improve fleet productivity and profitability require applications that report diagnostic information  location including for purposes of geo fencing  time of use information  emergency notification  driver usage and maintenance alerts for their heavy equipment  which may be geographically dispersed  often in remote  difficult to reach locations 
using mm data communications systems  heavy equipment fleet operators can remotely manage the productivity and mechanical condition of their equipment fleets  potentially lowering operating costs through preventive maintenance 
oems can also use mm applications to better anticipate the maintenance and spare parts needs of their customers  expanding the market for more higher margin spare parts orders for the oems 
heavy equipment oems are increasingly integrating mm data communications systems into their equipment at the factory or offering them as add on options through certified after market dealers 
since the heavy equipment market is dominated by a small number of oems  mm data communications service providers targeting this market segment focus on building relationships with these oems  such as caterpillar  komatsu  hitachi and volvo 
fixed asset monitoring companies with widely dispersed fixed assets require a means of collecting data from remote assets to monitor productivity  minimize downtime and realize other operational benefits  as well as managing and controlling the functions of such assets  for example  the remote operation of valves and electrical switches 
mm data communications systems can provide industrial companies with applications for automated meter reading  oil and gas storage tank monitoring  pipeline monitoring and environmental monitoring  which can reduce operating costs for these companies  including labor costs  fuel costs  and the expense of on site monitoring and maintenance 
marine vessels marine vessels have a need for satellite based communications due to the absence of reliable terrestrial based coverage more than a few miles offshore 
mm data communications systems may offer features and functions to luxury recreational marine vessels and commercial fishing vessels  such as onboard diagnostics and other marine telematics  alarms  requests for assistance  security  location reporting and tracking  e mail and two way messaging  catch data and weather reports 
in addition  owners and operators of commercial fishing and other marine vessels are increasingly subject to regulations governing  among other things  commercial fishing seasons and geographic limitations  vessel tracking  safety systems  and resource management and protection using various mm communications systems 
government and homeland security governments worldwide are seeking to address the global terror threat by monitoring land borders and hazardous materials  as well as marine vessels and containers 
in addition  modern military and public safety forces use a variety of applications  particularly in supply chain management  logistics and support  which could incorporate our products and services 
increasingly  there is a need to monitor these vessels for homeland security and mm data communications systems could be used in applications to address homeland security requirements  such as tracking and monitoring these vessels and containers 

table of contents mm communications systems can also be used in applications to address infiltration across land borders  for example  monitoring seismic sensors placed along the border to detect incursions 
we may also be able to leverage our work with ais to resell  subject in certain circumstances to us coast guard approval  ais data collected by our network to other coast guard services and governmental agencies 
consumer transportation automotive companies are seeking a means to address the growing need for safety systems in passenger vehicles and to broadcast a single message to multiple vehicles at one time 
within the automotive market  there is no single communications technology that satisfies the need for coverage  high reliability and low cost 
an example of an automotive safety application is a system that has the ability to detect and report the deployment of a vehicle s airbag  triggering the dispatch of an ambulance  tow truck or other necessary response personnel 
many automotive safety systems currently in service are based on analog cellular communications networks  many of which are being phased out over the next several years in favor of digital cellular networks 
in addition  terrestrial cellular communications systems have substantial dead zones  where network coverage is not available  and are difficult to manage globally  as vehicles may pass through multiple coverage areas  requiring the system to roam across a number of different cellular carriers networks 
with emerging technology  satellite based automotive safety systems may be able to provide near real time message delivery with minimal network latencies  thereby providing a viable alternative to cellular based systems 
in addition  many cellular based automotive safety systems adopted or being adopted lack backwards compatibility that could limit their overall functionality 
while our system currently has latency limitations which make it impractical for us to address this market fully  we believe that our existing network may be used with dual mode devices  combining our subscriber communicators with communications devices for cellular networks  allowing our communications services to function as an effective back up system by filling the coverage gaps in current cellular or wireless networks used in consumer transportation applications 
in addition  we may undertake additional capital expenditures beyond our current capital plan in order to expand our satellite constellation and lower our latencies to the level that addresses the requirements of resellers and oems developing applications for this market if we believe the economic returns justify such an investment 
we believe we can supplement our satellite constellation within the lead time required to integrate applications using our communications service into the automotive oem product development cycle 
products and services our principal products and services are satellite based data communications services and product sales from subscriber communicators 
during the third quarter of  we commenced terrestrial based cellular communications services  which consist of reselling airtime using a cellular provider s wireless technology network and product sales from cellular wireless sims for use with devices or equipment that enable the use of the cellular provider s wireless network for data communications 
revenues from terrestrial based services and products were not significant in our communications services are used by businesses and government agencies that are engaged in tracking  monitoring  controlling or communicating with fixed or mobile assets globally 
our low cost  industrially rated subscriber communicators are embedded into many different assets for use with our system 
our products and services are combined with industry or customer specific applications developed by our vars which are sold to their end user customers 
we do not generally market to end users directly  instead  we utilize a cost effective sales and marketing strategy of partnering with vars  ivars and country representatives 
these resellers  which are our direct customers  market to end users 
satellite communications services we provide global two way mm data communications services through our satellite based system 
we focus our communications services on narrowband data applications 
these data messages are typically sent by a remote subscriber communicator through our satellite system to our ground facilities for forwarding through an appropriate terrestrial communications network to the ultimate destination 

table of contents terrestrial cellular communication services these communication services support higher bandwidth applications that are not typical for an orbcomm application 
these data messages are sent by cellular wireless sims which are routed through the cellular provider s wireless network to our ground facilities and forwarded to the ultimate destination in real time 
these services commenced in the third quarter of and revenues from such services were not significant in our system  typically combined with industry or customer specific applications developed by our resellers  permits a wide range of fixed and mobile assets to be tracked  monitored  controlled and communicated with from a central point 
we typically derive subscription based recurring revenue from our var and ivar customers based upon the number of subscriber communicators and sims activated on  and the amount of data transmitted through  our communications system 
customers pay between and in monthly service charges to access our communications system generally in addition to a one time provisioning fee ranging of up to which we believe is the lowest price point currently available for global two way connectivity

subscriber communicators our wholly owned subsidiary  stellar  markets and sells subscriber communicators manufactured by delphi directly to our customers 
we also earn a one time royalty fee from third parties for the use of our proprietary communications protocol  which enables subscriber communicators to connect to our mm data communications system 
to ensure the availability of subscriber communicators having different functional capabilities in sufficient quantities to meet demand  we have provided extensive design specifications and technical and engineering support to our manufacturers 
in addition  because we maintain backwards compatibility  subscriber communicators produced by former manufacturers are still in use with our system today 
stellar currently sells two models of subscriber communicators  the ds and the ds  which are manufactured by delphi 
delphi is now stellar s sole manufacturing source for subscriber communicators 
and it is

other than ge which represented approximately of our revenues for fiscal  no other customer accounted for more than of our total sales in fiscal key strategic relationships delphi automotive systems llc in may  we entered into a cooperation agreement with stellar and delphi corporation  a tier one automotive components supplier that designs  manufacturers and supplies advanced automotive grade subscriber communicators for stellar for use with our satellite communications system 
pursuant to the agreement  and subject to limited exceptions  delphi corporation s delphi automotive system llc subsidiary  or delphi  is the sole supplier of subscriber communicators for stellar 
delphi corporation has a right of first refusal following termination of the agreement to supply stellar with new products developed under the cooperation agreement 
the initial term of the agreement was until december  and it has been extended by mutual written agreement of the parties until december  we are in discussions with delphi to further extend the agreement 
although delphi is currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings  it manufactures our subscriber communicators in mexico with non unionized labor  and as a result  we do not believe that such bankruptcy proceedings should impact our contract with delphi corporation 
this relationship provides stellar access to delphi s substantial technical and manufacturing resources  which we believe enables stellar to continue to lower the cost of our subscriber communicators while at the same time providing improved features 
as a result of lower subscriber communicator costs from delphi we have significantly reduced the selling price from approximately per unit in to as little as per unit in volume in several of stellar s customers are now in the process of full commercial roll out using these less costly  new generation subscriber communicators 
in addition to providing a lower cost subscriber communicators with higher reliability  we believe that delphi also has the capability to increase production rapidly to meet additional demand as stellar expands its business 
general electric company we have a significant customer relationship with general electric company  that provides access to a wide array of sales channels and extends to several divisions and businesses  including ge equipment services  which includes trailer fleet services  its penske truck leasing joint venture  rail services and its ge asset intelligence llc subsidiary  or ai  among others 
all of these ge equipment services divisions directly or indirectly sell applications utilizing our mm data communications services and subscriber communicators manufactured by stellar 
as a result  ge equipment services has a number of different sales channels for the distribution of our asset monitoring and tracking products either to third party end users or to other ge divisions who are end users 
ai s first application  veriwise  enables ge s customers to track and monitor their trailer assets and shipments throughout the world 
ge rail services is also integrating our mm data communications system into its railwise application for railcars 
ge equipment services european division offers railwise and we expect ge equipment services to begin marketing both veriwise and railwise into other international markets 
penske truck leasing also uses our mm data communications system to monitor tractor trailers  and other ge businesses are monitoring many different types of assets  including ge healthcare s portable mri machines  locomotives for ge rail  tractor trailers for penske truck leasing  and portable electric generators for ge energy

we have included the ais capability in our quick launch satellites and intend to outfit our subsequent satellites with the ais capability 
we may be able to leverage this work to resell  subject in certain circumstances to us coast guard approval  ais data collected by our network to other coast guard services and governmental agencies  as well as companies engaged in security or logistics businesses for tracking shipping activities or for other navigational purposes 
ais is a shipboard broadcast system that transmits a marine vessel s identification and position to aid navigation and improve maritime safety 
the international maritime organization has mandated the use of ais on all safety of life at sea solas vessels  which are vessels over tons 
current terrestrial based ais networks provide limited coverage and are not able to provide the expanded coverage capability desired by the us coast guard 
by using our satellite system  the us coast guard is expected to be able to collect and process ais data well beyond the coast of the united states in a cost effective and timely fashion 
as of december   the us coast guard has paid us the full contract price of million  primarily for the construction and launch of an ais enabled demonstration satellite  excluding additional amounts which may become payable if the us coast guard elects to receive additional maintenance and ais data transmission services under the contract 
such payments are included in deferred revenue 
due to the fact that the launch of our original shared vehicle did not take place principally as a result of the cancellation of the primary launch vehicle payload  our launch services provider  with our participation  has been seeking an alternative launch vehicle for the coast guard demonstration satellite 
as a result of this delay  in february  the us coast guard issued a unilateral modification to our contract setting a definitive launch date of july  with respect to the coast guard demonstration satellite 
on september   we and the us coast guard entered into an amendment of solicitation modification of contract amending the agreement to extend the definitive launch date to december  in consideration for agreeing to extend the launch date  we will provide up to hours of additional technical support for up to months after the launch date at no cost and reduce the us coast guard s cost for the post launch maintenance option and for certain usage options 
the coast guard demonstration satellite was to be launched with our quick launch satellites  however the launch did not occur by december  on january   we received a cure notice from the us coast guard notifying us that unless the satellite is launched within days after receipt of the cure notice  the us coast guard may terminate the agreement for default 
we believe that the launch of the coast guard demonstration satellite will likely extend beyond the day cure period 
on march   we received a 
table of contents proposed contract modification from the us coast guard  providing for an april  launch date deadline and furnishing all ais data transmitted by ais over our complement of ais equipped satellites coast guard demonstration satellite and quick launch satellites for a period of continuous days at no cost 
the satellites are fully constructed and are undergoing testing  however  certain issues have arisen in the electromagnetic compatibility testing of the quick launch satellites that need to be resolved before launch 
we are currently in discussions with the us coast guard to extend the deadline for the launch of the coast guard demonstration satellite to a mutually acceptable date 
however  there can be no assurance as to whether or when a mutually satisfactory agreement for an extension of the launch deadline will be agreed to by the parties 
in the event that we and the us coast guard are unable to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution regarding the launch of the coast guard demonstration satellite  the us coast guard may terminate the contract and pursue the remedies available to it 
the company has indemnification rights against the launch services provider for the coast guard demonstration satellite in the event the launch services contract is terminated for default from and against any and all claims  demands  assessments and all liabilities and costs related thereto for which the company becomes liable  including but not limited to any assessment of damages and or reprocurement costs by the united states government 
sales  marketing and distribution we generally market our satellite and terrestrial communications services through vars and internationally through ivars  international licensees and country representatives 
the following chart shows how our low cost  multi channel distribution network is structured flow chart vars and ivars 
we are currently working with approximately vars and ivars and seek to continue to increase the number of our vars and ivars as we expand our business 
the role of the var or ivar is to develop tailored applications that utilize our system and then market these applications  through non exclusive licenses  to specific  targeted vertical markets 
vars and ivars are responsible for establishing retail pricing  collecting airtime revenue from end users and for providing customer service and support to end users 
our relationship with a var or ivar may be direct or indirect and may be governed by a reseller agreement between us  the international licensee or country representative  on the one hand  and the var or ivar on the other hand  that establishes the var s or ivar s responsibilities with respect to the business  as well as the cost of satellite service to the var or ivar 
vars and ivars are responsible for their own development and sales costs 
vars and ivars typically have unique industry knowledge  which permits them to develop applications targeted for a particular industry or market 
our vars and ivars have made significant investments in developing orbcomm based applications 
these applications often require significant time and financial investment to develop for commercial use 
by leveraging these investments  we are able to minimize our own research and development costs  increase the scale of our business without increasing overhead and diversify our business risk among many sales channels 
vars and ivars pay fees for access to our system based on the number of subscriber communicators they have activated on the network and on the amount of data transmitted 
vars and ivars are also generally required to pay a one time fee for each subscriber communicator activated on our system and for other administrative charges 
vars and ivars then typically bill end users based upon the full value of the application and are responsible for customer care to the end user 

table of contents we are currently working with approximately ivars 
generally  subject to certain regulatory restrictions  the ivar arrangement allows us to enter into a single agreement with any given ivar and allows the ivars to pay directly to us a single price on a single monthly invoice in a single currency for worldwide service  regardless of the territories they are selling into  thereby avoiding the need to negotiate prices with individual international licensees and country representatives 
we pay our international licensees and country representatives a commission on revenues received from ivars from each subscriber communicator activated in a specific territory 
the terms of our reseller agreements with ivars typically provide for a three year initial term that is renewable for additional three year terms 
under these agreements  the ivar is responsible for promoting their applications in their respective territory  providing sales forecasts and provisioning information to us  collecting airtime revenue from end users and paying invoices rendered by us 
in addition  ivars are responsible for providing customer support and maintaining sufficient inventory of subscriber communicators in their respective territories 
international licensees and country representatives 
we generally market and distribute our services outside the united states and canada primarily through international licensees and country representatives  including through our subsidiary  satcom international group plc  which has entered into country representative agreements with our affiliated international licensee  orbcomm europe llc  covering the united kingdom  ireland and switzerland and a service license agreement covering substantially all of the countries of the middle east and a significant number of countries of central asia 
in addition  orbcomm europe and satcom have entered into an agreement obligating orbcomm europe to enter into a country representative agreement for turkey with satcom  if the current country representative agreement for turkey expires or is terminated for any reason 
we rely on these third parties to establish business in their respective territories  including obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory and other approvals  as well as managing local vars 
in addition  we believe that our international licensees and country representatives  through their local expertise  are able to operate in these territories in a more efficient and cost effective manner 
we currently have agreements covering over countries and territories through our seven international licensees and country representatives 
as we seek to expand internationally  we expect to continue to enter into agreements with additional international licensees and country representatives  particularly in asia and africa 
international licensees and country representatives are generally required to make the system available in their designated regions to vars and ivars 
in territories with multiple countries  it is typical for our international licensees to appoint country representatives 
country representatives are sub licensees within the territory 
they perform tasks assigned by the international licensee 
in return  the international licensees are responsible for  among other things  operating and maintaining the necessary gateway earth stations within their designated regions  obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals to provide our services in their designated regions  and marketing and distributing our services in such regions 
country representatives are entities that obtain local regulatory approvals and establish local marketing channels to provide orbcomm services in their designated countries 
as a us company  we are not legally qualified to hold a license to operate as a telecommunications provider in some countries and our country representative program permits us to serve many international markets 
in some cases  a country representative enters into a joint venture with us 
in other cases  the country representative is an independent entity that pays us fees based on the amount of airtime usage on our system 
country representatives may distribute our services directly or through a distribution network made up of local vars 
subject to certain limitations  our service license agreements grant to the international licensee  among other things  the exclusive right subject to our right to appoint ivars to market services using our satellite system in a designated region and a limited right to use certain of our proprietary technologies and intellectual property 
international licensees and country representatives who are appointed by us pay fees for access to the system in their region based on the number of subscriber communicators activated on the network in their territory and the amount of data transmitted through the system 
we may adjust pricing in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreements 
we pay international licensees and country representatives a commission based on the revenue we receive from ivars that is generated from subscriber communicators that ivars activate in their territories 
we have entered into or are negotiating new service license or country representative agreements with several international licensees and country representatives  respectively  including former licensees of the predecessor 
table of contents company and new groups consisting of affiliates of former licensees of the predecessor company lp until new service license agreements are in place  we will operate in those regions where a licensee has not been contracted either pursuant to letters of intent entered into with such licensee or pursuant to the terms of the original agreements with the predecessor company  as is currently the case in japan  south korea and morocco 
there can be no assurance we will be successful in negotiating new service license or country representative agreements 
subscriber communicators our subsidiary  stellar  markets and sells subscriber communicators manufactured by delphi directly to customers 
we also earn a one time royalty fee from third parties for the use of our proprietary communications protocol  which enables subscriber communicators to connect to our mm data communications system 
we believe that declining prices for our subscriber communicators have opened further the market for orbcomm based applications 
we will seek to increase the functionality  variety and reliability of our subscriber communicators  while at the same time providing cost savings to end users 
competition currently  we are the only commercial provider of below ghz band  or little leo  two way data satellite services optimized for narrowband 
however  we are not the only provider of data communication services  and we face competition from a variety of existing and proposed products and services 
competing service providers can be divided into three main categories terrestrial tower based  low earth orbit mobile satellite and geostationary satellite service providers 
terrestrial tower based networks while terrestrial tower based networks are capable of providing services at costs comparable to ours  they lack seamless global coverage 
terrestrial coverage is dependent on the location of tower transmitters  which are generally located in densely populated areas or heavily traveled routes 
several data and messaging markets  such as long haul trucking  railroads  oil and gas  agriculture  utility distribution and heavy construction  have significant activity in sparsely populated areas with limited or no terrestrial coverage 
in addition  there are many different terrestrial systems and protocols  so service providers must coordinate with multiple carriers to enable service in different coverage areas 
in some geographic areas  terrestrial tower based networks have gaps in their coverage and may require a back up system to fill in such coverage gaps 
in  we have entered into re seller agreements with two major cellular wireless providers to provide terrestrial communications services to our customers using the wireless communications networks of these cellular wireless providers 
low earth orbit mobile satellite service providers low earth orbit mobile satellite service providers operating above the ghz band  or big leo systems  can provide data connectivity with global coverage that can compete with our communications services 
to date  the focus of big leo satellite service providers has been primarily on circuit switched communications tailored for voice traffic  which  by its nature  is less efficient for the transfer of short data messages because they require a dedicated circuit that is time and bandwidth intensive when compared to the amount of information transmitted 
however  big leo satellite service providers are expected to focus more on mm data communications 
these systems entail significantly higher costs for the satellite fleet operator and the end users 
our principal big leo mobile satellite service competitors are globalstar  inc and iridium holdings llc 
geostationary satellite service providers geostationary satellite system operators can offer services that compete with ours 
certain pan regional or global systems operating in the l or s bands  such as inmarsat plc  are designed and licensed for mobile high speed data and voice services 
however  the equipment cost and service fees for narrowband  or small packet  data communications with these systems is significantly more expensive than for our system 
some companies  such as the omnitracs subsidiary of qualcomm incorporated  which uses ses s satellites operating in c and ku bands  have developed technologies to use their bandwidth for mobile applications 
we believe that the equipment 
table of contents cost and service fees for narrowband data communications using these systems are also significantly higher than ours  and that these geostationary providers cannot offer global service with competitive communications devices and costs 
in addition  these geostationary systems have other limitations that we are not subject to 
for example  they require a clear line of sight between the communicator equipment and the satellite  are affected by adverse weather or atmospheric conditions  and are vulnerable to catastrophic single point failures of their satellites with limited backup options 
research and development vars incur the majority of research and development costs associated with developing applications for end users 
although we provide assistance and development expertise to our vars 
we do not engage in significant research and development activities of our own 
with respect to development of our next generation satellites  we do not incur direct research and development costs  however  we contract with third parties who undertake research and development activities in connection with supplying us with satellite payloads  buses and launch vehicles 
we have invested and continue to invest in development of advanced features for our subscriber communicator hardware 
for instance  stellar paid approximately million and million to delphi in and  respectively  in connection with the development of next generation subscriber communicators that should provide increased functionality at a lower cost 
backlog the backlog of subscriber communicators at our stellar subsidiary as of december  was  units  or approximately million  which includes  units under the agreement see key strategic relationships general electric company 
the backlog as of december  was  units  or approximately million which included  units of additional cancelable volume under the agreement 
we believe that approximately million of the backlog as of december  will be filled during fiscal in addition  our pre bill backlog  which represents subscriber communicators activated at the customer s request for testing prior to putting the units into actual service  was  units as of december   as compared with a pre bill backlog of  units as of december  we believe that the majority of units that comprise our pre bill backlog will be billable within a one year period 
we are not able to determine pre bill backlog in dollars because the service costs for each subscriber communicator varies by customer 
orbcomm communications system overview our data communications services are provided by our proprietary two way satellite system  which is designed to provide near real time and store and forward communication to and from both fixed and mobile assets around the world 
during the third quarter of  we began providing terrestrial cellular wireless data communications services through a reseller agreement with a cellular wireless provider 
our system has three operational segments the space segment  which consists of a constellation of operational satellites in multiple orbital planes between and miles above the earth four primary planes of six to eight satellites each and one polar plane satellite operating in the vhf band  the ground and control segment  which consists of fifteen operational gateway earth stations that send signals to and receive signals from the satellites  four gateway control centers that process message traffic and forward it through the gateway earth stations to the satellites or to appropriate terrestrial communications networks for transmission to the back office application or end user and the network control center including two of the four gateway control centers located in dulles  virginia  which monitors and manages the flow of information through the system and provides the command  control and telemetry functions to optimize satellite availability  and 
table of contents the subscriber segment  which consists of the subscriber communicators and terrestrial communications devices used by end users to transmit and receive messages to and from their assets and our system 
for most applications using our system  data is generated by end user developed software and currently transferred to either a subscriber communicator  or a gprs based wireless device using a sim on the cellular provider s wireless network 
in the case of the satellite subscriber communicator selection  data is encapsulated and transmitted to the next satellite that comes into view 
the data is then routed by the satellite to the next gateway earth station it successfully connects to  which in turn forwards it to the associated gateway control center 
within the gateway control center  the data is processed and forwarded to its ultimate destination after acknowledgement to the satellite subscriber communicator that the entire data message content has been received 
in the case of the wireless device  a message is routed through the cellular provider s wireless network gateway gprs support node  or ggsn  to the associated orbcomm access point name  or apn  located within the gateway control center and forwarded to its ultimate destination in real time 
the destination may be another subscriber communicator  a corporate resource management system  any personal or business internet e mail address  a pager or a cellular phone 
in addition  data can be sent in the reverse direction a feature which is utilized by many applications to remotely control assets 
when a satellite is in view of and connected to a gateway earth station at the time it receives data from a subscriber communicator  a transmission is initiated to transfer the data in what we refer to as near real time mode 
in this near real time mode  the data is passed immediately from a subscriber communicator to a satellite and onto the gateway earth station to the appropriate control center for routing to its final destination 
when a satellite is not immediately in view of a gateway earth station  the satellite switches to a store and forward mode to accept data in globalgram format 
these globalgrams are short messages consisting of data of up to approximately bytes and are stored in a satellite until it can connect through a gateway earth station to the appropriate control center 
the automatic mode switching capability between near real time service and globalgram service allows the satellite network to be available to the satellite subscriber communicators worldwide regardless of their location 
end user data can be delivered by the gateway control center in a variety of formats 
communications options include private and public communications links to the control center  such as standard internet  dedicated telephone company and vpn based transports 
data can also be received via standard e mail protocols with full delivery acknowledgement as requested  or via our internet protocol gateway interface in html and xml formats 
wherever possible  our system makes use of existing  mature technologies and conforms to internationally accepted standards for electronic mail and web technologies 
for wireless based applications  the orbcomm apn provides the flexibility for developers to control the end to end connectivity as needed for the application  using customizable tcp  udp  and sms services 
this allows existing legacy applications to be retrofit and completely new system designs to be implemented to integrate existing as well as new end user business applications 
system status satellite replenishment in we intend to conduct a satellite launch which includes the coast guard demonstration satellite and five of our six quick launch satellites in a single mission to replenish existing satellites and to augment the existing constellation in order to expand the messaging capacity of our network and improve the service level of our network 
due to delays associated with the construction of the final quick launch satellite  we intend to retain it for future deployment 
on april   we entered into an agreement with orbital sciences corporation to supply the payloads for our six quick launch satellites 
the price of the six payloads is million  subject to price adjustments for late penalties and on time or early delivery incentives 
on june   we entered into an agreement with ohb system ag  an affiliate of ohb technology ag  to design  develop and manufacture six satellite buses  integrate such buses with the payloads to be provided by orbital sciences corporation  and launch the six integrated satellites 
the price for the six satellite buses and related integration and launch services is million and payments under the agreement are due upon specific milestones achieved by ohb system ag 
if ohb system ag meets specific on time delivery milestones  we would be obligated to pay up to an additional million 

table of contents satellite health the majority of our current satellite fleet was put into service in the late s and has an estimated operating life of approximately nine to twelve years after giving effect to certain operational changes and software updates 
we believe that our satellite performance remains stable and sufficient for the use of our customers 
our satellite availability  or the percentage of time that a satellite is available to pass commercial traffic  was in twenty three of the twenty nine operational satellites have aggregate average availability over 
with the high probability of several satellites in view at any one time  especially in the primary coverage area  and the constant motion of the satellites  the time a satellite is unavailable is relatively insignificant 
due to our satellite constellation architecture  which consists of numerous independent satellites  our space segment is inherently redundant and service quality is not significantly affected by individual satellite failures 
our system has experienced minor degradation over time  equal to less than over the past five years excluding four satellites that have slightly lower commercial service capability 
our plane f polar satellite  one of the original prototype first generation satellites launched in  was retired in april  due to intermittent service  without any material impact on our service 
prior to such retirement  a failure occurred in october  prior to our acquisition of the satellite constellation in  when a satellite experienced a processor malfunction 
these failures are less than anticipated failure rates and demonstrate the benefits of a distributed satellite system architecture like ours 
gateway health we believe that the functionality of the ground segment of our system remains stable and sufficient for the use of our customers 
the gateway earth stations in the united states are performing well 
several infrastructure upgrades have been completed over the past few years including software upgrades which improved power conditioning and remote monitoring 
in general  our international gateway control centers are stable 
our gateway control centers located in korea and japan have all regularly exceeded availability on a month to month basis 
in addition  our international gateway earth stations are performing reasonably well 
we intend to continue to proactively provide preventative maintenance and training to the international operators of gateway earth station and gateway control center segments  we believe that our international ground segment components remain sufficient to provide a consistent level of availability and quality for the use of our customers 
network capacity over the last two years  we have conducted analyses to investigate the utilization of our communication channels 
various metrics were used in evaluating the different elements of the communication protocol 
the efficiency of the satellites random access subscriber receivers is measured as the ratio of successfully received inbound communication packets to the number of assignments made to subscriber communicators 
in the beginning of  the average value of this ratio was approximately  which is lower than the expected ratio of between and 
throughout and  a number of improvements were made to raise this performance ratio to over 
several modifications also were made in that impacted satellite capacity directly  resulting in a substantial increase in throughput capability 
further analysis and code optimizations are now in progress  and preliminary indications are that these will also contribute tangible increases in overall satellite throughput 
it should be noted that failed messaging transactions do not result in lost messages  but do require subscriber communicators to re initiate message transmissions 
for the user  such instances could translate into message delays 
regulation of our system in the united states fcc authorization any entity seeking to construct  launch  or operate a commercial satellite system in the united states must first be licensed by the fcc 
orbcomm license corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  holds the satellite constellation license originally issued to orbcomm global lp in which we refer to as the space segment license 
the space segment license currently authorizes construction  launch and operation of a constellation of 
table of contents initial and twelve additional little leo satellites  and we have additional licenses to operate four united states gateway earth stations  and deploy and operate up to  subscriber communicators in the united states 
we believe that our system is currently in full compliance with all applicable fcc rules  policies  and license conditions 
although we did not construct and launch the additional twelve satellites authorized in the second processing round by the fcc imposed march deadline  we timely filed for a three year extension of the deadline 
the fcc has not yet acted on that extension request  and there can be no assurance the fcc will grant the extension  in which case we would need to re apply for authority to expand our satellite constellation above the originally authorized satellites 
alternatively  the fcc could establish new construction and launch milestones as part of the modification for the quick launch and next generation satellites 
we believe that we will continue to be able to comply with all applicable fcc requirements  although we cannot assure you that it will be the case 
our next generation satellites will have additional capabilities  and the transmission characteristics will differ from our current satellites 
these new satellites may also operate on additional frequency ranges beyond those authorized in our current license 
the use of additional frequencies and or transmission differences of the new satellites would likely render them not technically identical to our current satellites under the applicable rules and policies of the fcc 
as a result  on may   we filed an application at the fcc requesting modification of our satellite constellation license to permit launch and operation of our quick launch satellites  the coast guard demonstration satellite  and our next generation satellites 
on september   we filed an application for special temporary authority  or sta  to launch and operate the coast guard demonstration satellite and the quick launch satellites in the event that the fcc does not act on the modification application in sufficient time prior to the launch of these satellites 
on november   we filed a supplemental amendment to our modification application to address issues raised by the fcc following the filing of the sta application relating to the choice of satellite telecommand frequencies for the quick launch satellites 
both the modification application  and the supplemental amendment to the modification application  have been placed on public notice by the fcc  and have completed the statutory period for submission of petitions to deny with no oppositions filed 
in the past  we have applied for  and have been granted  several license modifications and do not have any reason to believe that the fcc will deny our pending modification application  or any other such modification application we may file in the future 
there is no assurance  however  that the fcc will grant our pending modification application  our pending sta  or any future modification applications on a timely basis or at all 
license renewal the initial term of the space segment license ends on april  we timely filed the renewal application for the space segment license on march   in accordance with the fcc s little leo space segment license renewal rules  and the renewal application appeared on public notice as accepted for filing on march  no oppositions to the renewal application were filed during the statutory period for such submissions following the issuance of that public notice 
the current fcc licenses for the united states gateway earth stations and subscriber communicators expire on may  and june   respectively  and the renewal applications must be filed between and days prior to expiration 
although the fcc has indicated that it is positively disposed towards granting license renewals to a little leo licensee that complies with little leo licensing policies  there can be no assurance that our space segment license renewal will be granted 
fcc license conditions we believe that our system is currently in full compliance with all applicable fcc rules  policies  and license conditions 
although we did not construct and launch the additional twelve satellites authorized in the second processing round by the fcc imposed march deadline  we timely filed for a three year extension of the deadline 
the fcc has not yet acted on that extension request  and there can be no assurance the fcc will grant the extension  in which case we would need to re apply for authority to expand our satellite constellation above the originally authorized satellites 
alternatively  the fcc could establish new construction and launch milestones as part of the modification for the quick launch and next generation satellites 
we believe that we will continue to be able to comply with all applicable fcc requirements  although we cannot assure you that it will be the case 
our next generation satellites will have additional capabilities  and the transmission characteristics will differ from our 
table of contents current satellites 
these new satellites may also operate on additional frequency ranges beyond those authorized in our current license 
the use of additional frequencies and or transmission differences of the new satellites would likely render them not technically identical to our current satellites under the applicable rules and policies of the fcc 
as a result  on may   we filed an application at the fcc requesting modification of our satellite constellation license to permit launch and operation of our quick launch satellites  the coast guard demonstration satellite  and our next generation satellites 
on september   we filed an application for special temporary authority  or sta  to launch and operate the coast guard demonstration satellite and the quick launch satellites in the event that the fcc does not act on the modification application in sufficient time prior to the launch of these satellites 
on november   we filed a supplemental amendment to our modification application to address issues raised by the fcc following the filing of the sta application relating to the choice of satellite telecommand frequencies for the quick launch satellites 
both the modification application  and the supplemental amendment to the modification application  have been placed on public notice by the fcc  and have completed the statutory period for submission of petitions to deny with no oppositions filed 
in the past  we have applied for  and have been granted  several license modifications and do not have any reason to believe that the fcc will deny our pending modification application  or any other such modification application we may file in the future 
there is no assurance  however  that the fcc will grant our pending modification application  our pending sta  or any future modification applications on a timely basis or at all 
access in the united states to certain portions of the uplink and downlink spectrum assigned to our system was made subject to possible future spectrum sharing arrangements with as many as four other little leo systems that the fcc conditionally authorized in march there are currently no other little leo licensees authorized in our spectrum 
while other entities could seek to be licensed in the little leo service by the fcc  to our knowledge no new applications have been submitted to date 
if any one or more new entities are licensed and do in fact proceed with system deployment in accordance with the previously established fcc requirements  we believe that there would be no material adverse effect on our system operations  although we cannot assure you it will be the case 
non common carrier status all of our system s fcc licenses authorize service provision on a non common carrier basis 
as a result  the system and the services provided thereby have been subject to limited fcc regulations  but not the obligations  restrictions and reporting requirements applicable to common carriers or to providers of commercial mobile radio services  or cmrs 
there can be no assurance  however  that in the future  we will not be deemed by the fcc to provide services that are designated common carrier or cmrs  or that the fcc will not exercise its discretionary authority to apply its common carrier or cmrs rules and regulations to us or our system 
if this were to occur  we would be subject to fcc obligations that include record retention requirements  limitations on use or disclosure of customer proprietary network information and truth in billing regulations 
in addition  we would need to obtain fcc approval for foreign ownership in excess of percent and authority under section of the communications act of  as amended  to provide international services 
finally  we would be subject to additional reporting obligations with regard to international traffic and circuits  and equal employment opportunity compliance 
united states import and export control regulations we are subject to us import and export control laws and regulations  specifically the arms export control act  the international traffic in arms regulations  the export administration regulations and the trade sanctions laws and regulations administered by the us department of the treasury s office of foreign assets control  and we believe we are in full compliance with all such laws and regulations 
we also believe that we have obtained all the specific authorizations currently needed to operate our business and believe that the terms of the relevant licenses are sufficient given the scope and duration of the activities to which they pertain 
regulation of our system in other countries communications services we  the relevant international licensee and or the relevant international licensee s country representative in each country outside the united states must obtain the requisite local regulatory authorization before the commencement of service in that country 
the process for obtaining the applicable regulatory authorization varies 
table of contents from country to country  and in some instances may require technical studies or actual experimental field tests under the direction and or supervision of the local regulatory authority 
failure to obtain or maintain any requisite authorizations in any given country or territory could mean that services may not be provided in that country or territory 
certain countries continue to require that some or all telecommunications services be provided by a government owned or controlled entity 
therefore  under such circumstances  we may be required to offer our services through a government owned or controlled entity 
to date the provision of services has been authorized by regulators in jurisdictions where regulatory authority is required in over countries and territories in north america  europe  south america  asia  africa  mexico and australia 
as part of our international initiative  we are in the process of seeking or assessing the prospect of obtaining regulatory authority in other countries and territories  including china  india and russia 
because our satellites are licensed by the fcc  the scope of the local regulatory authority in any given country or territory outside of the united states with the exception of countries where gateway earth stations are located is generally limited to the operation of subscriber communicator equipment  but may also involve additional restrictions or conditions 
based on available information  we believe that the regulatory authorizations obtained by us  our international licensees and or their country representatives are sufficient for the provision of commercial services in the subject countries and territories  subject to continuing regulatory compliance 
we also believe that additional local service provision authorizations may be obtained in other countries and territories in the near future 
non us gateway earth stations to date  in addition to those in the united states  gateway earth stations have been authorized and deployed in argentina  australia  brazil  cura ao  italy  japan  kazakhstan  malaysia  morocco and south korea 
gateway earth stations are generally licensed on an individual facility basis 
this process normally entails radio frequency coordination within the country of operation for the specific frequencies to be used in the designated geographic location of the subject gateway earth station 
this domestic frequency coordination is in addition to any international coordination that may be required  as determined by the proximity of the gateway earth station location to foreign borders see international regulation of our system 
based on the best available information  we believe that each of the above listed gateway earth stations authorizations is sufficient for the provision of our commercial services in the areas served by the relevant facilities 
we will need additional gateway earth station authorizations in other countries as we install additional gateway earth stations around the world 
equipment standards each manufacturer of the applicable subscriber communicator is contractually responsible to obtain and maintain the governmental authorizations necessary to operate their subscriber communicators in each jurisdiction 
most countries generally require all radio transmission equipment used within their borders to comply with operating standards that may include specifications relating to required minimum acceptable levels for radiated power  power density and spurious emissions into adjacent frequency bands not allocated for the intended use 
technical criteria established by telecommunications equipment standards issued by the fcc and or the european telecommunications standards institute  or etsi  are generally accepted  and or closely duplicated by domestic equipment approval regulations in most countries 
all current models of subscriber communicators comply with established fcc standards and many comply with etsi standards 
international regulation of our system our use of certain orbital planes and related system radio frequency assignments  as licensed by the fcc  is subject to the frequency coordination and registration process of the itu 
in order to protect satellite systems from harmful radio frequency interference from other satellite communications systems  the itu maintains a master international frequency register  or mifr  of radio frequency assignments and their associated orbital locations 
each itu member state referred to as an administration is required by treaty to give notice of  coordinate and register its proposed use of radio frequency assignments and associated orbital locations with the itu s radio communication bureau 

table of contents the fcc serves as the notifying administration for the united states and is responsible for filing and coordinating our allocated radio frequency assignments and associated orbital locations for the system with both the itu s radio communication bureau and the national administrations of other countries in each satellite s service region 
while the fcc  as our notifying administration  is responsible for coordinating the system  in practice the satellite licensee is generally responsible for identifying any potential interference concerns with existing systems or those enjoying date priority and to coordinate with such systems 
if we are unable to reach agreement and finalize coordination  the fcc would then assist with such coordination 
when the coordination process is completed  the itu formally enters each satellite system s orbital and frequency use characteristics in the mifr 
such registration notifies all proposed users of frequencies that the registered satellite system is protected from interference from subsequent or non conforming uses by other nations 
in the event disputes arise during coordination  the itu s radio regulations do not contain mandatory dispute resolution or enforcement mechanisms and dispute resolution procedures are based on the willingness of the parties concerned to reach a mutually acceptable agreement voluntarily 
neither the itu specifically  nor international law generally  provides clear remedies if this voluntary process fails 
the fcc has notified the itu that our system was initially placed in service in april and that it has operated without any substantiated complaints of interference since that time 
the fcc has also informed the itu that our system has successfully completed its coordination with all countries other than russia 
we expect that we will successfully complete the itu coordination process with russia in the near future  at which time the complete system will be formally registered in the mifr 
on september   the fcc transmitted an advance publication submission to the itu relating to the coast guard demonstration satellite  the quick launch satellites and the next generation satellites  the first step in the international coordination process for our new satellites 
if design modifications to future system satellites entail substantial changes to the frequency utilization by the subject system component s  additional international coordination may be required or reasonably deemed advisable 
however  we believe that itu coordination can be successfully completed in all circumstances where such coordination is required  although we cannot assure you that we will successfully complete such itu coordination 
failure to complete requisite itu coordination could have a material adverse effect on our business 
regardless  to date  and to our best knowledge  the system has not caused harmful interference to any other radio system  or suffered harmful interference from any other radio system

item a 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k 
any of these risks could also materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or the price of our common stock 
because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  past financial performance should not be considered as a reliable indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
risks relating to our business we are incurring substantial operating losses and net losses 
we anticipate additional future losses 
we must significantly increase our revenues to become profitable 
we have had annual net losses since our inception  including a net loss of million for fiscal year and at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our future results will continue to reflect significant operating expenses  including expenses associated with expanding our sales and marketing efforts  maintaining the infrastructure to operate as a public company and product development for our subscriber communicator products for use with our system 
as a result  we anticipate additional operating losses and net losses in the future 
the continued development of our business also will require additional capital expenditures for  among other things  the development  construction and launch of additional satellites  including more capable next generation satellites  the development of more advanced subscriber communicators for use with our system and the installation of additional gateway earth stations and gateway control centers around the world 
accordingly  as we make these capital investments  our future results will include greater depreciation and amortization expense which reflect the full cost of acquiring these new assets 
in order to become profitable  we must achieve substantial revenue growth 
revenue growth will depend on acceptance of our products and services by end users in current markets  as well as in new geographic and industry markets 
we may not become profitable and we may not be able to sustain such profitability  if achieved 
we may need additional capital  which may not be available to us when we need it on favorable terms  or at all 
if our future cash flows from operations are less than expected or if our capital expenditures exceed our spending plans  our existing sources of liquidity  including cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash generated from sales of our products and services may not be sufficient to fund our anticipated operations  capital expenditures including the deployment of additional satellites  working capital and other financing requirements 
if we continue to incur operating losses in the future  we may need to reduce further our operating costs or obtain alternate sources of financing  or both  to remain viable and  in particular  to fund the design  production and launch of additional satellites  including the next generation satellites 
we cannot assure you that we will have access to additional sources of capital on favorable terms or at all 
we incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company  and our management devotes substantial time to new compliance initiatives 
we incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses as a public company  including costs resulting from regulations regarding corporate governance practices 
for example  the listing requirements of the nasdaq global 
table of contents market require that we satisfy certain corporate governance requirements relating to independent directors  audit committees  distribution of annual and interim reports  stockholder meetings  stockholder approvals  solicitation of proxies  conflicts of interest  stockholder voting rights and codes of conduct 
our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives 
moreover  these rules and regulations have increased our legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time consuming and costly 
for example  these rules and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors  our board committees or as executive officers 
if end users do not accept our services and the applications developed by vars or we cannot obtain the necessary regulatory approvals or licenses for particular countries or territories  we will fail to attract new customers and our business will be harmed 
our success depends on end users accepting our services  the applications developed by vars  and a number of other factors  including the technical capabilities of our system  the availability of low cost subscriber communicators  the receipt and maintenance of regulatory and other approvals in the united states and other countries and territories in which we operate  the price of our services and the extent and availability of competitive or alternative services 
we may not succeed in increasing revenue from the sale of our products and services to new and existing customers 
our failure to significantly increase the number of end users will harm our business 
our business plan assumes that potential customers and end users will accept certain limitations inherent in our system 
for example  our system is optimized for small packet  or narrowband  data transmissions  is subject to certain delays in the relay of messages  referred to as latencies  and may be subject to certain line of sight limitations between our satellites and the end user s subscriber communicator 
in addition  our satellite system is not capable of handling voice traffic 
certain potential end users  particularly those requiring full time  real time communications and those requiring the transmission of large amounts of data greater than eight kilobytes per message or voice traffic  may find such limitations unacceptable 
in addition to the limitations imposed by the architecture of our system  our failure to obtain the necessary regulatory and other approvals or licenses in a given country or territory will preclude the availability of our services in such country or territory until such time  if at all  that such approvals or licenses can be obtained 
certain potential end users requiring messaging services in those countries and territories may find such limitations unacceptable 
we face competition from existing and potential competitors in the telecommunications industry  including numerous terrestrial and satellite based network systems with greater resources  which could reduce our market share and revenues 
competition in the telecommunications industry is intense  fueled by rapid  continuous technological advances and alliances between industry participants seeking to capture significant market share 
we face competition from numerous existing and potential alternative telecommunications products and services provided by various large and small companies  including sophisticated two way satellite based data and voice communication services and next generation digital cellular services  such as gsm and g 
in addition  a continuing trend toward consolidation and strategic alliances in the telecommunications industry could give rise to significant new competitors  and any foreign competitor may benefit from subsidies from  or other protective measures by  its home country 
some of these competitors may provide more efficient or less expensive services than we are able to provide  which could reduce our market share and adversely affect our revenues and business 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources than we do 
additionally  many of these companies have greater name recognition and more established relationships with our target customers 
furthermore  these competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer customers more attractive terms than we can 
we have a limited operating history  which makes it difficult to evaluate your investment in us 
we have conducted commercial operations only since april  when we acquired substantially all of our current communications system from orbcomm global lp and its subsidiaries 
our prospects and ability to implement our current business plan  including our ability to provide commercial two way data communications 
table of contents service in key markets on a global basis and to generate revenues and positive operating cash flows  will depend on our ability to  among other things successfully construct  launch  place in commercial service  operate and maintain our u 
s coast guard demonstration and our quick launch and next generation satellites in a timely and cost effective manner  develop licensing and distribution arrangements in key markets within and outside the united states sufficient to capture and retain an adequate customer base  install the necessary ground infrastructure and obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory and other approvals in key markets outside the united states through our existing or future international licensees to expand our business internationally  and provide for the timely design  manufacture and distribution of subscriber communicators in sufficient quantities  with appropriate functional characteristics and at competitive prices  for various applications 
given our limited operating history  there can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve these objectives or develop a sufficiently large revenue generating customer base to achieve profitability 
in particular  because we acquired a fully operational satellite constellation and communications system from orbcomm global lp and its subsidiaries  our current management team has limited experience with managing the design  construction and launch of a satellite system 
we rely on third parties to market and distribute our services to end users 
if these parties are unwilling or unable to provide applications and services to end users  our business will be harmed 
we rely on vars to market and distribute our services to end users in the united states and on international licensees  country representatives  vars and ivars  outside the united states 
the willingness of companies to become international licensees  country representatives  vars and ivars which we refer to as resellers will depend on a number of factors  including whether they perceive our services to be compatible with their existing businesses  whether they believe we will successfully deploy next generation satellites  whether the prices they can charge end users will provide an adequate return  and regulatory restrictions  if any 
we believe that successful marketing of our services will depend on the design  development and commercial availability of applications that support the specific needs of the targeted end users 
the design  development and implementation of applications require the commitment of substantial financial and technological resources on the part of these resellers 
certain resellers are  and many potential resellers will be  newly formed or small ventures with limited financial resources  and such entities might not be successful in their efforts to design applications or effectively market our services 
the inability of these resellers to provide applications to end users could have a harmful effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also believe that our success depends upon the pricing of applications by our resellers to end users  over which we have no control 
defects or errors in applications could result in end users not being able to use our services  which would damage our reputation and harm our financial condition 
vars  ivars  international licensees and country representatives must develop applications quickly to keep pace with rapidly changing markets 
these applications have long development cycles and are likely to contain undetected errors or defects  especially when first introduced or when subsequent versions are introduced  which could result in the disruption of our services to the end users 
while we sometimes assist our resellers in developing applications  we have limited ability to accelerate development cycles to avoid errors and defects in their applications 
such disruption could damage our reputation as well as the reputation of the respective resellers  and result in lost customers  lost revenue  diverted development resources  and increased service and warranty costs 
because we depend on a significant customer for a substantial portion of our revenues  the loss or decline or slowdown in growth in business of this customer could seriously harm our business 
ge  a significant customer  represented and of our revenues in and  respectively  primarily from sales to ge asset intelligence llc  or ai  a subsidiary of ge equipment services  of subscriber communicators by our stellar subsidiary and service revenues from our orbcomm llc subsidiary 
we expect 
table of contents ge equipment services to continue to represent a substantial part of our revenues in the near future 
ai did not purchase its minimum committed volume for under the agreement and  as a result  ai is in default under the terms of the agreement 
we are currently in discussions with ai to amend the agreement to extend the time periods within which ai is required to purchase its minimum committed volumes 
however  there can be no assurance as to whether or when a mutually satisfactory amendment will be agreed to by the parties 
in the event that we and ai are unable to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution regarding the agreement  we may pursue remedies available to us 
as a result  the loss of this customer  including the termination of the agreement or decline or slowdown in the growth in business of this customer  which could occur at any time  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if our international licensees and country representatives are not successful in establishing their businesses outside of the united states  the prospects for our business will be limited 
outside of the united states  we rely largely on international licensees and country representatives to establish businesses in their respective territories  including obtaining and maintaining necessary regulatory and other approvals as well as managing local vars 
international licensees and country representatives may not be successful in obtaining and maintaining the necessary regulatory and other approvals to provide our services in their assigned territories and  even if those approvals are obtained  international licensees and or country representatives may not be successful in developing a market and or distribution network within their territories 
certain of the international licensees and or country representatives are  or are likely to be  newly formed or small ventures with limited or no operational history and limited financial resources  and any such entities may not be successful in their efforts to secure adequate financing and to continue operating 
in addition  in certain countries and territories outside the united states  we rely on international licensees and country representatives to operate and maintain various components of our system  such as gateway earth stations 
these international licensees and country representatives may not be successful in operating and maintaining such components of our communications system and may not have the same financial incentives as we do to maintain those components in good repair 
some of our international licensees and country representatives are experiencing significant operational and financial difficulties and have in the past defaulted on their obligations to us 
many of our international licensees and country representatives were also international licensees and country representatives of the predecessor company and  as a consequence of the bankruptcy of orbcomm global lp  they were left in many cases with significant financial problems  including significant debt and insufficient working capital 
certain of our international licensees and country representatives including in japan  korea  malaysia  parts of south america and to a lesser extent  europe have not been able to successfully or adequately reorganize or recapitalize themselves and as a result have continued to experience significant material difficulties  including the failure to pay us for our services 
to date  several of our licensees and country representatives have had difficulty in paying their usage fees and have not paid us or have paid us at reduced rates  and in cases where collectibility is not reasonably assured  we have not reflected invoices issued to such licensees and country representatives in our revenues or accounts receivable 
the ability of these international licensees and country representatives to pay their obligations to us may be dependent  in many cases  upon their ability to successfully restructure their business and operations or raise additional capital 
in addition  we have from time to time had disagreements with certain of our international licensees related to these operational and financial difficulties 
to the extent these international licensees and country representatives are unable to reorganize and or raise additional capital to execute their business plans on favorable terms or are delayed in doing so  our ability to offer services internationally and recognize revenue will be impaired and our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
we rely on a limited number of manufacturers for our subscriber communicators 
if we are unable to  or cannot find third parties to  manufacture a sufficient quantity of subscriber communicators at a reasonable price  the prospects for our business will be negatively impacted 
the development and availability on a timely basis of relatively inexpensive subscriber communicators are critical to the successful commercial operation of our system 
our stellar subsidiary relies on a contract 
table of contents manufacturer  delphi automotive systems llc  or delphi  a subsidiary of delphi corporation  to produce subscriber communicators 
our customers may not be able to obtain a sufficient supply of subscriber communicators at price points or with functional characteristics and reliability that meet their needs 
an inability to successfully develop and manufacture subscriber communicators that meet the needs of customers and are available in sufficient numbers and at prices that render our services cost effective to customers could limit the acceptance of our system and potentially affect the quality of our services  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
delphi corporation filed for bankruptcy protection in october our business may be materially and adversely affected if stellar s agreement with delphi corporation is terminated or modified as part of delphi corporation s reorganization in bankruptcy or otherwise 
if our agreements with third party manufacturers are  or stellar s agreement with delphi corporation is  terminated or expire  our search for additional or alternate manufacturers could result in significant delays  added expense and an inability to maintain or expand our customer base 
any of these events could require us to take unforeseen actions or devote additional resources to provide our services and could harm our ability to compete effectively 
we are currently in discussions with delphi to extend our agreement which expired on december  there are currently three manufacturers of subscriber communicators  including quake global  inc  or quake  mobile applitech  inc 
and our stellar subsidiary 
if our agreements with third party manufacturers  including our subscriber communicator manufacturing agreement with quake  are terminated or expire  our search for additional or alternate manufacturers could result in significant delays in customers activating subscriber communicators on our communications system  added expense for our customers and our inability to maintain or expand our customer base 
we depend on recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and our inability to do so would seriously harm our business 
because of the technical nature of our services and the market in which we compete  our success depends on the continued services of our current executive officers and certain of our engineering personnel  and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees or our inability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business and our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not have key man life insurance policies covering any of our executive officers or key technical personnel 
competitors and others have in the past  and may in the future  attempt to recruit our employees 
the available pool of individuals with relevant experience in the satellite industry is limited  and the process of identifying and recruiting personnel with the skills necessary to operate our system can be lengthy and expensive 
in addition  new employees generally require substantial training  which requires significant resources and management attention 
even if we invest significant resources to recruit  train and retain qualified personnel  we may not be successful in our efforts 
our management team is subject to a variety of demands for its attention and rapid growth and litigation could further strain our management and other resources and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently face a variety of challenges  including maintaining the infrastructure and systems necessary for us to operate as a public company  addressing our pending litigation matters and managing the recent rapid expansion of our business 
our recent growth and expansion has increased our number of employees and the responsibilities of our management team 
any litigation  regardless of the merit or resolution  could be costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management 
as we continue to expand  we may further strain our management and other resources 
our failure to meet these challenges as a result of insufficient management or other resources could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be subject to litigation proceedings that could adversely affect our business 
we may be subject to legal claims or regulatory matters involving stockholder  consumer  antitrust and other issues 
we and certain of our officers have been named as defendants in a class action lawsuit claiming  among other 
table of contents things  material misstatements or omissions in our registration statement related to our initial public offering in november litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include money damages 
if an unfavorable ruling were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations for the period in which the ruling occurred or future periods 
our business is characterized by rapid technological change and we may not be able to compete with new and emerging technologies 
we operate in the telecommunications industry  which is characterized by extensive research and development efforts and rapid technological change 
new and advanced technology which can perform essentially the same functions as our service though without global coverage  such as next generation digital cellular networks gsm and g  direct broadcast satellites  and other forms of wireless transmission  are in various stages of development by others in the industry 
these technologies are being developed  supported and rolled out by entities that may have significantly greater resources than we do 
these technologies could adversely impact the demand for our services 
research and development by others may lead to technologies that render some or all of our services non competitive or obsolete in the future 
because we operate in a highly regulated industry  we may be subjected to increased regulatory restrictions which could disrupt our service or increase our operating costs 
system operators and service providers are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of various countries and the rules and policies they adopt 
these rules and policies  among other things  establish technical parameters for the operation of facilities and subscriber communicators  determine the permissible uses of facilities and subscriber communicators  and establish the terms and conditions pursuant to which our international licensees and country representatives operate their facilities  including certain of the gateway earth stations and gateway control centers in our system 
these rules and policies may also require our international licensees and country representatives to cut off the data passing through the gateway earth stations or gateway control centers without notifying us or our end users  significantly disrupting the operation of our communications system 
these rules and policies may also regulate the use of subscriber communicators within certain countries or territories 
international and domestic licensing and certification requirements may cause a delay in the marketing of our services and products  may impose costly procedures on our international licensees and country representatives  and may give a competitive advantage to larger companies that compete with our international licensees and country representatives 
possible future changes to regulations and policies in the countries in which we operate may result in additional regulatory requirements or restrictions on the services and equipment we provide  which may have a material adverse effect on our business and operations 
although we believe that we or our international licensees and country representatives have obtained all the licenses required to conduct our business as it is operated today  we may not be able to obtain  modify or maintain such licenses in the future 
moreover  changes in international or domestic licensing and certification requirements may result in disruptions of our communications services or alternatively result in added operational costs  which could harm our business 
our use of certain orbital planes and vhf assignments  as licensed by the fcc  is subject to the frequency coordination and registration process of the itu 
in the event disputes arise during coordination  the itu s radio regulations do not contain mandatory dispute resolution or enforcement mechanisms and neither the itu specifically  nor does international law generally  provide clear remedies in this situation 
our business would be negatively impacted if the fcc revokes or fails to renew or amend our licenses 
our fcc licenses a license for the satellite constellation  separate licenses for the four us gateway earth stations and a blanket license for the subscriber communicators are subject to revocation if we fail to satisfy certain conditions or to meet certain prescribed milestones 
while the fcc satellite constellation license is valid until april   we were required  slightly more than three years prior to the expiration of the fcc satellite constellation license  to apply for a license renewal with the fcc 
the renewal application was timely filed with the fcc on march   and appeared on public notice on march  the us gateway earth station and subscriber communicator licenses will expire in renewal applications for the gateway earth station and subscriber communicator licenses must be filed between and days prior to expiration 
although the fcc has 
table of contents indicated that it is positively disposed towards granting license renewals to a below ghz band  or little leo  licensee that complies with the applicable fcc licensing policies  there can be no assurance that the fcc will in fact renew our fcc licenses 
if the fcc revokes or fails to renew our fcc licenses  or if we fail to satisfy any of the conditions of our fcc licenses  such action could have a material adverse impact on our business 
in addition  because our new satellites are not likely to be considered technically identical replacement satellites  we have applied to the fcc for a modification of our satellite constellation license for the coast guard demonstration satellite  the quick launch satellites and the next generation satellites 
because the fcc may not act on our pending modification application prior to the launch of the coast guard demonstration satellite or the quick launch satellites  we have also filed an application for special temporary authority  or sta  to launch and operate these satellites until the fcc acts on the underlying modification application 
there can be no assurance that these pending fcc applications  or any such fcc application s  will be granted on a timely basis  or at all 
finally  our business could be adversely affected by the adoption of new laws  policies or regulations  or changes in the interpretation or application of existing laws  policies and regulations that modify the present regulatory environment 
our business would be harmed if our international licensees and country representatives fail to acquire and retain all necessary regulatory approvals 
our business is affected by the regulatory authorities of the countries in which we operate 
due to foreign ownership restrictions in various jurisdictions around the world  obtaining local regulatory approval for operation of our system is the responsibility of our international licensees and or country representatives in each of these licensed territories 
in addition  in certain countries regulatory frameworks may be rudimentary or in an early stage of development  which can make it difficult or impossible to license and operate our system in such jurisdictions 
there can be no assurance that our international licensees and or country representatives will be successful in obtaining any additional approvals that may be desirable and  if they are not successful  we will be unable to provide service in such countries 
our inability to offer service in one or more important new markets  particularly in china or india  would have a negative impact on our ability to generate more revenue and would diminish our business prospects 
there are numerous risks inherent to our international operations that are beyond our control 
international telecommunications services are subject to country and region risks 
most of our coverage area and some of our subsidiaries are outside the unites states 
as a result  we are subject to certain risks on a country by country or region by region basis  including changes in domestic and foreign government regulations and telecommunications standards  licensing requirements  tariffs or taxes and other trade barriers  exchange controls  expropriation  and political and economic instability  including fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies which may make payment in us dollars more expensive for foreign customers or payment in foreign currencies less valuable for us 
certain of these risks may be greater in developing countries or regions  where economic  political or diplomatic conditions may be significantly more volatile than those commonly experienced in the united states and other industrialized countries 
we do not currently maintain in orbit insurance for our satellites 
we do not currently maintain in orbit insurance coverage for our satellites to address the risk of potential systemic anomalies  failures or catastrophic events affecting the existing satellite constellation 
we may obtain launch insurance for the launch of our us coast guard demonstration and five quick launch satellites combined in a single mission and our next generation satellites 
however  any determination as to whether we procure insurance  including in orbit and launch insurance  will depend on a number of factors  including the availability of insurance in the market and the cost of available insurance 
we may not be able to obtain insurance at reasonable costs 
even if we obtain insurance  it may not be sufficient to compensate us for the losses we may suffer due to applicable deductions and exclusions 
if we experience significant uninsured losses  such events could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents risks related to our technology we do not currently have back up facilities for our network control center 
in the event of a general failure at our network control center  our system will be disrupted and our operations will be harmed 
the core control segment of our system is housed at our network control center in dulles  virginia 
we currently do not have back up facilities for certain essential command and control functions that are performed by our network control center  and as a result  our system and business operations remain vulnerable to the possibility of a failure at our network control center 
there would be a severe disruption to the functionality of our system in the event of a failure at our network control center 
although we plan to install a back up network control center in  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the installation on a timely basis or that such a back up network would eliminate disruption to our system in the event of a failure 
new satellites are subject to launch failures  delays and cost overruns  the occurrence of which can materially and adversely affect our operations 
satellites are subject to certain risks related to failed or delayed launches 
launch failures result in significant delays in the deployment of satellites because of the need both to construct replacement satellites  and to obtain other launch opportunities 
launch delays can be caused by a number of factors  including delays in manufacturing satellites  preparing satellites for launch  securing appropriate launch vehicles or obtaining regulatory approvals 
we intend to conduct a satellite launch in both to replace existing satellites and to augment the existing constellation in order to expand the messaging capacity of our network and improve the service level of our network 
our intended launch which includes the coast guard demonstration satellite and five of the six quick launch satellites in a single mission is important to us to test and ultimately to leverage our work with ais to resell  subject in certain circumstances to us coast guard approval  ais data collected by our satellites as well as to augment our satellite constellation 
in addition  this launch which will supplement and ultimately replace our existing plane a satellites is important to maintain adequate service levels and to provide additional capacity for future subscriber growth 
a failure or delay or cost overrun of either our coast guard demonstration satellite or our quick launch satellites could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  including our obligations under our contract with the us coast guard 
see we may be in default under our contract with the us coast guard with respect to the coast guard demonstration satellite if we do not launch the satellite within the cure period or any extension thereof  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any launch failures of our additional satellites could result in delays of at least six to nine months from the date of the launch failure until additional satellites under construction are completed and their launches are achieved 
such delays would have a negative impact on our future growth and would materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be in default under our contract with the us coast guard with respect to the coast guard demonstration satellite if we do not launch the satellite within the cure period or any extension thereof  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the coast guard demonstration satellite is to be launched with our quick launch satellites  however  due to delays with the quick launch satellites  the launch did not occur by the december  deadline specified in our contract with the us coast guard 
on january   we received a cure notice from the us coast guard notifying us that unless the coast guard demonstration satellite is launched within days after receipt of the cure notice  the us coast guard may terminate the contract for default 
we believe that the launch of the coast guard demonstration satellite will likely extend beyond the day cure period 
on march   we received a proposed contract modification from the us coast guard  providing for an april  launch date deadline and furnishing all ais data transmitted by ais over our complement of ais equipped satellites coast guard demonstration satellite and quick launch satellites for a period of continuous days at no additional cost 
the satellites are fully constructed and are undergoing testing  however  certain issues have arisen in the electromagnetic compatibility testing of the quick launch satellites that need to be resolved before launch 
we are currently in discussions with the us coast guard to extend the deadline for the launch of the coast guard demonstration satellite to a mutually acceptable date 
however  there can be no assurance as to whether or when a mutually satisfactory agreement for an extension of the launch deadline will be agreed to by the parties 
in the event that we 
table of contents and the us coast guard are unable to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution regarding the launch of the coast guard demonstration satellite  the us coast guard may terminate the contract for default and pursue the remedies available to it 
the termination of the us coast guard contract and the resulting liability could have a material adverse effect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our satellites have a limited operating life 
if we are unable to deploy replacement satellites  our services will be harmed 
the majority of our first generation satellites was placed into orbit beginning in the last of our first generation satellites was launched in late our first generation satellites have an average operating life of approximately nine to twelve years after giving effect to certain operational changes and software updates 
in  we plan to launch five of the six quick launch satellites together with our coast guard demonstration satellite in a single mission to supplement and ultimately replace our existing plane a satellites and we plan to finance further development our next generation satellites 
in addition to supplementing and replacing our first generation satellites  these next generation satellites would also expand the capacity of our communications system to meet forecasted demand as we grow our business 
we anticipate using cash and cash equivalents on hand and funds generated from operations to pay for costs relating to future satellites 
we are dependent on a limited number of suppliers to provide the payload  bus and launch vehicle for our quick launch and next generation satellites and any delay or disruption in the supply of these components and related services will adversely affect our ability to replenish our satellite constellation and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in  we entered into agreements with orbital sciences corporation to supply us with the payloads of our six quick launch satellites  and with ohb system ag to supply the buses and related integration and launch services for these quick launch satellites with options for two additional buses and related integration services 
in addition  we will need to enter into arrangements with outside suppliers to provide us with the three different components for our next generation satellites the payload  bus and launch vehicle 
our reliance on these suppliers for their services involves significant risks and uncertainties  including whether our suppliers will provide an adequate supply of required components of sufficient quality  will charge the agreed upon prices for the components or will perform their obligations on a timely basis 
if any of our suppliers becomes financially unstable  we may have to find a new supplier 
there are a limited number of suppliers for communication satellite components and related services and the lead time required to qualify a new supplier may take several months 
there is no assurance that a new supplier will be found on a timely basis  or at all  if any one of our suppliers ceases to supply their services for our satellites 
if we do not find a replacement supplier on a timely basis  we may experience significant delays in the launch schedule of our coast guard demonstration and five quick launch satellites which are to be launched in a single mission in and additional satellites and incur additional costs to establish an alternative supplier 
any delay in our launch schedule could adversely affect our ability to provide communications services  particularly as the health of our current satellite constellation declines and we could lose current or prospective customers as a result of service interruptions 
the loss of any of our satellite suppliers or delay in our launch schedule could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations including putting us in default under our contract with the us coast guard 
see we may be in default under our contract with the us coast guard with respect to the coast guard demonstration satellite if we do not launch the satellite within the cure period or any extension thereof  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents once launched and properly deployed  our satellites are subject to significant operating risks due to various types of potential anomalies 
satellites utilize highly complex technology and operate in the harsh environment of space and  accordingly  are subject to significant operational risks while in orbit 
these risks include malfunctions  or anomalies  that may occur in our satellites 
some of the principal satellite anomalies include mechanical failures due to manufacturing error or defect  including mechanical failures that degrade the functionality of a satellite  such as the failure of solar array panel deployment mechanisms  antenna failures that degrade the communications capability of the satellite  circuit failures that reduce the power output of the solar array panels on the satellites  failure of the battery cells that power the payload and spacecraft operations during daily solar eclipse periods  and communications system failures that affect overall system capacity 
equipment degradation during the satellite s lifetime  including degradation of the batteries ability to accept a full charge  degradation of solar array panels due to radiation  and general degradation resulting from operating in the harsh space environment 
deficiencies of control or communications software  including failure of the charging algorithm that may damage the satellite s batteries  problems with the communications and messaging servicing functions of the satellite  and limitations on the satellite s digital signal processing capability that limit satellite communications capacity 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  anomalies in some of the categories described above 
the effects of these anomalies include  but are not limited to  degraded communications performance  reduced power available to the satellite in sunlight and or eclipse  battery overcharging or undercharging and limitations on satellite communications capacity 
some of these effects may be increased during periods of greater message traffic and could result in our system requiring more than one attempt to send messages before they get through to our satellites 
although these effects do not result in lost messages  they could lead to increased messaging latencies for the end user and reduced throughput for our system 
see the orbcomm communications system system status network capacity 
while we have already implemented a number of system adjustments and have 
we cannot assure you that these actions will succeed or adequately address the effects of any anomalies in a timely manner or at all 
a total of satellites were launched by orbcomm global lp and of these  a total of remain operational 
our plane f polar satellite  one of the original prototype first generation satellites launched in  was retired in april due to intermittent service 
the other five satellites that are not operational experienced failures early in their lifetime and the previous mission ending satellite failure affecting our system occurred in october  prior to our acquisition of the satellite constellation 
the absence of these six satellites slightly increases system latency and slightly decreases overall capacity  although these system performance decreases have not materially affected our business  as our business model already reflects the fact that we acquired only operational satellites in other operating risks  such as collisions with space debris  could materially affect system performance and our business 
while certain software deficiencies may be corrected remotely  most  if not all  of the satellite anomalies or debris collision damage cannot be corrected once the satellites are placed in orbit 
see the orbcomm communications system system status network capacity for a description of the operational status and anomalies that affect our satellites 
we may experience anomalies in the future  whether of the types described 
table of contents above or arising from the failure of other systems or components  and operational redundancy may not be available upon the occurrence of such an anomaly 
technical or other difficulties with our gateway earth stations could harm our business 
our system relies in part on the functionality of our gateway earth stations  some of which are owned and maintained by third parties 
while we believe that the overall health of our gateway earth stations remains stable  we may experience technical difficulties or parts obsolescence with our gateway earth stations which may negatively impact service in the region covered by that gateway earth station 
certain problems with these gateway earth stations can reduce their availability and negatively impact the performance of our system in that region 
for example  the owner of the malaysian gateway earth station has been unable to raise sufficient capital to properly maintain this gateway earth station 
we are also experiencing commercial disputes with the entities that own the gateway earth stations in japan and korea 
in addition  due to regulatory and licensing constraints in certain countries in which we operate  we are unable to wholly own or majority own some of the gateway earth stations in our system located outside the united states 
as a result of these ownership restrictions  we rely on third parties to own and operate some of these gateway earth stations 
if our relationship with these third parties deteriorates or if these third parties are unable or unwilling to bear the cost of operating or maintaining the gateway earth stations  or if there are changes in the applicable domestic regulations that require us to give up any or all of our ownership interests in any of the gateway earth stations  our control over our system could be diminished and our business could be harmed 
our system could fail to perform or perform at reduced levels of service because of technological malfunctions or deficiencies or events outside of our control which would seriously harm our business and reputation 
our system is exposed to the risks inherent in a large scale  complex telecommunications system employing advanced technology 
any disruption to our services  information systems or communication networks or those of third parties into which our network connects could result in the inability of our customers to receive our services for an indeterminate period of time 
satellite anomalies and other technical and operational deficiencies of our communications system described in this annual report on form k could result in system failures or reduced levels of service 
in addition  certain components of our system are located in foreign countries  and as a result  are potentially subject to governmental  regulatory or other actions in such countries which could force us to limit the operations of  or completely shut down  components of our system  including gateway earth stations or subscriber communicators 
any disruption to our services or extended periods of reduced levels of service could cause us to lose customers or revenue  result in delays or cancellations of future implementations of our products and services  result in failure to attract customers or result in litigation  customer service or repair work that would involve substantial costs and distract management from operating our business 
the failure of any of the diverse and dispersed elements of our system  including our satellites  our network control center  our gateway earth stations  our gateway control centers or our subscriber communicators  to function and coordinate as required could render our system unable to perform at the quality and capacity levels required for success 
any system failures or extended reduced levels of service could reduce our sales  increase costs or result in liability claims and seriously harm our business 
risks related to an investment in our common stock the price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  volatile and your investment may decline in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile and purchasers of our common stock could incur substantial losses 
further  our common stock has a limited trading history 
factors that could affect the trading price of our common stock include liquidity of the market in  and demand for  our common stock  changes in expectations as to our future financial performance or changes in financial estimates  if any  of market analysts  
table of contents actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations  including quarterly results  our financial performance failing to meet the expectations of market analysts or investors  our ability to raise additional funds to meet our capital needs  the outcome of any litigation by or against us  including any judgments favorable or adverse to us  conditions and trends in the end markets we serve and changes in the estimation of the size and growth rate of these markets  announcements relating to our business or the business of our competitors  investor perception of our prospects  our industry and the markets in which we operate  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  loss of one or more of our significant customers  changes in governmental regulation  changes in market valuation or earnings of our competitors  and general economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq global market and the market for telecommunications companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies affected 
these broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
such litigation has been instituted against us and could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could materially harm our business  financial condition  future results and cash flow 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock will continue to depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business 
if we do not continue to maintain adequate research coverage or if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business  our stock price would likely decline 
if one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly  demand for our stock could decrease  which could cause our stock price and trading volume to decline 
we are subject to anti takeover provisions which could affect the price of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our bylaws contain provisions that could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions do not permit actions by our stockholders by written consent and require the approval of the holders of at least of our outstanding common stock entitled to vote to amend certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws 
in addition  these provisions include procedural requirements relating to stockholder meetings and stockholder proposals that could make stockholder actions more difficult 
our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors serving staggered  three year terms and may be removed only for cause 
any vacancy on the board of directors may be filled only by the vote of the majority of directors then in office 
our board of directors have the right to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer  effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our board of directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more for our 
table of contents outstanding common stock 
although we believe these provisions provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders and may delay or prevent an acquisition of our company

organization orbcomm llc was organized as a delaware limited liability company on april  and on april   we acquired substantially all of the non cash assets and assumed certain liabilities of orbcomm global lp and its subsidiaries  which had filed for relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
the assets acquired from orbcomm global lp and its subsidiaries consisted principally of the in orbit satellites and supporting us ground infrastructure equipment that we own today 
at the same time  orbcomm llc also acquired the fcc licenses required to own and operate the communications system from a subsidiary of orbital sciences corporation  which was not in bankruptcy  in a related transaction 
prior to april   orbcomm llc did not have any operating activities 
we were formed as a delaware corporation in october and on february   the members of orbcomm llc contributed all of their outstanding membership interests in orbcomm llc to us in exchange for shares of our common stock  representing ownership interests in us equal in proportion to their prior ownership interest in orbcomm llc 
as a result of  and immediately following the contribution  orbcomm llc became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
we refer to this transaction as the reorganization 
overview we operate the only global commercial wireless messaging system optimized for narrowband communications 
our system consists of a global network of low earth orbit  or leo  satellites and accompanying ground infrastructure 
our two way communications system enables our customers and end users  which include large and established multinational businesses and government agencies  to track  monitor  control and communicate cost effectively with fixed and mobile assets located anywhere in the world 
in  we began providing terrestrial based cellular communication services through a re seller agreement with a major cellular wireless provider 
these services commenced in the third quarter of and revenues from such services were not significant in in addition  a re seller agreement was signed with a second major cellular wireless provider in the fourth quarter of and services with this provider are expected to commence in the first half of these terrestrial based communication services enable our customers who have higher bandwidth requirements to receive and send messages from communication devices based on terrestrial based technologies using the cellular provider s wireless network as well as from dual mode devices combining our satellite subscriber communicators with devices for terrestrial based technologies 
as a result  our customers are now able to integrate in to their applications a terrestrial communications device that will allow them to add messages  including data intensive messaging from the cellular provider s wireless networks 

table of contents our products and services enable our customers and end users to enhance productivity  reduce costs and improve security through a variety of commercial  government and emerging homeland security applications 
we enable our customers and end users to achieve these benefits using a single global technology standard for machine to machine and telematic  or mm  data communications 
our customers have made significant investments in developing orbcomm based applications 
examples of assets that are connected through our mm data communications system include trucks  trailers  railcars  containers  heavy equipment  fluid tanks  utility meters  and pipeline monitoring equipment  marine vessels and oil wells 
our customers include original equipment manufacturers  or oems  such as caterpillar inc  komatsu ltd  hitachi construction machinery co  ltd 
and the volvo group  ivars  such as ge  vars  such as fleet management services  xata corporation and american innovations  ltd  and government agencies  such as the us coast guard 
in the second quarter of  we revised our definition of billable subscriber communicators to mean subscriber communicators which includes terrestrial units that are shipped and activated for usage and billing at the request of the customer  without forecasting a timeframe for when individual units will be generating usage and be billing 
in the past  we reported billable subscriber communicators defined as subscriber communicators activated and currently billing or expected to be billing within to days 
under the revised definition of billable subscriber communicators  as of december   we had approximately  billable subscriber communicators activated on our communications system compared to approximately  billable subscriber communicators as of december   an increase of approximately 
during the year ended december   we added approximately  net billable subscriber communicators on our communications system compared to approximately  net billable subscriber communicators added during the year ended december  we believe that our target markets in commercial transportation  heavy equipment  fixed asset monitoring  marine vessel  consumer transportation  and government and homeland security markets are significant and growing 
ebitda ebitda is defined as earnings before interest income expense  provision for income taxes and depreciation and amortization 
we believe ebitda is useful to our management and investors in evaluating our operating performance because it is one of the primary measures used by us to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations  including our ability to obtain and maintain our customers  our ability to operate our business effectively  the efficiency of our employees and the profitability associated with their performance  it also helps our management and investors to meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period on a consistent basis by removing the impact of our financing transactions and the depreciation and amortization impact of capital investments from our operating results 
in addition  our management uses ebitda in presentations to our board of directors to enable it to have the same measurement of operating performance used by management and for planning purposes  including the preparation of our annual operating budget 
ebitda is not a performance measure calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
while we consider ebitda to be an important measure of operating performance  it should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  or superior to  net loss or other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different than ebitda measures presented by other companies 
the following table reconciles our net loss to ebitda for the periods shown years ended december  in thousands net loss interest income interest expense a depreciation and amortization ebitda a includes amortization of deferred debt issuance costs and debt discount of approximately in 
table of contents ebitda in improved by million over this improvement was due to an increase in service revenues of million offset by an increase in operating expenses of million 
operating expenses increased in mostly due to increases in stock based compensation of million 
ebitda in decreased by million over this decrease was due to an increase in operating expenses of million to support the growth of the business  which was partially offset by higher net service revenues of million and a higher gross profit from product sales of million 
operating expenses increased due to an increase in staffing as we prepared to become a public company  an increase in stock based compensation of million resulting from the granting of restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in october  litigation expenses and consulting fees related to preparing for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act 
revenues we derive product revenues primarily from sales of subscriber communicators to our resellers ie  our vars  ivars  international licensees and country representatives and direct customers  as well as other products  such as subscriber communicator peripherals antennas  cables and connector kits 
during the third quarter of  we began selling cellular wireless subscriber identity modules  or sims  for our terrestrial communication services to our resellers and direct customers 
the revenues from these services were not significant in we also recognize revenues upon the installation of gateway earth stations 
we derive service revenues from our resellers and direct customers from utilization of satellite subscriber communicators on our communications system and the reselling of airtime from the utilization of terrestrial based subscriber communicators using sims on the cellular provider s wireless network 
these service revenues generally consist of a one time activation fee for each subscriber communicator and sims activated for use on our communications system and monthly usage fees 
usage fees that we charge our customers are based upon the number  size and frequency of data transmitted by the customer and the overall number of subscriber communicators and sims activated by each customer 
revenues for usage fees from currently billing subscriber communicators are recognized on an accrual basis  as services are rendered  or on a cash basis  if collection from the customer is not reasonably assured at the time the service is provided 
usage fees charged to our resellers and direct customers are charged primarily at wholesale rates based on the overall number of subscriber communicators activated by them and the total amount of data transmitted 
for one international licensee customer  we charge usage fees as a percentage of the international licensee s revenues 
service revenues also include a one time royalty fee from third parties for the use of our proprietary communications protocol  which enables subscriber communicators to connect to our mm data communications system and fees from providing engineering  technical and management support services to customers 
during  we entered into an agreement with the us coast guard  to design  develop  launch and operate a single satellite in connection with the concept validation project 
under the terms of the agreement  title to the demonstration satellite remains with us  however the us coast guard will be granted a non exclusive  royalty free license to use the intellectual property related to the designs  processes and procedures developed under the contract 
however  a fee will be charged to the us coast guard for data delivered under the agreement 
we are permitted under the agreement  and intend  to use the coast guard demonstration satellite to provide services to other customers  subject to receipt of a modification of our current license or special temporary authority from the fcc 
the agreement provides for post launch maintenance and ais data transmission services to be provided by us to the us coast guard for an initial term of months 
at its option  the us coast guard may elect to receive maintenance and ais data transmission services for up to an additional months subsequent to the initial term 
the deliverables under the agreement do not qualify as separate units of accounting and as a result  revenues from the agreement will be recognized ratably commencing upon the launch of the demonstration satellite expected in over the expected life of the customer relationship 
as a result of delays  in february  the us coast guard issued a unilateral modification to our contract setting a definitive launch date of july  with respect to the coast guard demonstration satellite 
on september   we and the us coast guard entered into an amendment of solicitation modification of contract amending the agreement to extend the definitive launch date to december  in consideration for 
table of contents agreeing to extend the launch date  we will provide up to hours of additional technical support for up to months after the launch date at no cost and reduce the us coast guard s cost for the post launch maintenance option and for certain usage options 
the coast guard demonstration satellite is to be launched with our quick launch satellites  however  due to delays with the quick launch satellites  the launch did not occur by december  on january   we received a cure notice from the us coast guard notifying us that unless the coast guard demonstration satellite is launched within days after receipt of the cure notice  the us coast guard may terminate the contract for default 
we believe that the launch of the coast guard demonstration satellite will likely extend beyond the day cure period 
on march   we received a proposed contract modification from the us coast guard  providing for an april  launch date deadline and furnishing all ais data transmitted by ais over our complement of ais equipped satellites coast guard demonstration satellite and quick launch satellites for a period of continuous days at no cost 
the satellites are fully constructed and are undergoing testing  however  certain issues have arisen in the electromagnetic compatibility testing of the quick launch satellites that need to be resolved before launch 
we are currently in discussions with the us coast guard to extend the deadline for the launch of the coast guard demonstration satellite to a mutually acceptable date 
however  there can be no assurance as to whether or when a mutually satisfactory agreement for an extension of the launch deadline will be agreed to by the parties 
in the event that we and the us coast guard are unable to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution regarding the launch of the coast guard demonstration satellite  the us coast guard may terminate the contract and pursue the remedies available to it 
the company has indemnification rights against the launch services provider for the coast guard demonstration satellite in the event the launch services contract is terminated for default from and against any and all claims  demands  assessments and all liabilities and costs related thereto for which the company becomes liable  including but not limited to any assessment of damages and or reprocurement costs by the united states government 
costs and expenses we own and operate a satellite constellation  six of the fifteen gateway earth stations and two of the four gateway control centers 
satellite based communications systems are typically characterized by high initial capital expenditures and relatively low marginal costs for providing service 
because we acquired substantially all of our existing satellite and network assets from orbcomm global lp for a fraction of their original cost in a bankruptcy court approved sale  we have benefited from lower amortization of capital costs than if the assets were acquired at orbcomm global lp s original cost 
our current satellites became fully depreciated during the fourth quarter of in  as discussed above  we plan on launching the coast guard demonstration satellite with five quick launch satellites in a single mission 
this increased equipment cost  reflected at full value  along with our planned acquisition of additional gateway earth stations and gateway control centers will cause our depreciation expense  a component of cost of services  to increase relative to the depreciation of our current communications system 
we currently anticipate that when additional satellites are placed into service  they will be depreciated over a period of ten years other than the coast guard demonstration satellite which will be depreciated over six years  representing the estimated operational lives of the satellites 
we incur engineering expenses associated with the operation of our communications system and the development and support of new applications  as well as sales  marketing and administrative expenses related to the operation of our business 
as of december   we have employees and we do not expect a significant increase in capital expenditures the majority of our current fleet of satellites was put in service in the late s and has an estimated operating life of approximately nine to twelve years 
we plan to launch additional satellites to supplement and ultimately replace our current fleet in order to continue to provide our communications services in the future 
for the year ended  we spent million on capital expenditures  of which million was for the coast guard demonstration satellite and million was for the quick launch and next generation satellites 
for the year ended 
table of contents  we spent  million on capital expenditures  of which  was for the quick launch and next generation satellites and for the year ended december  we spent  million on capital expenditures of which million was for the coast guard demonstration satellite 
our current intention is to replenish our constellation in a number of phases 
first  we are under contract with the us coast guard to conduct a demonstration test to validate the ability of an orbcomm satellite to receive ais signals from marine vessels over tons 
the satellite is in the final integration and test phase which we intend to launch with five of our six quick launch satellites together in in a single mission to supplement our plane a satellites with slightly upgraded communication capability compared to our current first generation satellites 
due to delays associated with the construction of the final quick launch satellite  we intend to retain it for future deployment 
finally  we intend to launch our next generation satellites with increased communications capabilities with the first of several launches commencing in we have started the procurement activities for the next generation satellites and are planning to award the next generation satellite and launch services contract in through a series of launches  we intend to replenish the existing constellation of satellites  which depending on the capabilities of the replacement satellites  may require fewer satellites than we currently have 
flexibility in the number of satellites per launch  the number of satellites inserted into each plane and target plane will allow us to modify our plans within just a few months before launch 
in addition  we intend to require our satellite manufacturers to include options for additional satellites that can be launched on an accelerated schedule if the market demands such an increase or if lower latencies are required or to mitigate a launch failure 
since  we have implemented several operational changes and software demonstration updates that we believe have enhanced the expected life of the satellites 
the majority of these changes focus on extending the life of the primary life limiting component the nickel hydrogen batteries which power the satellites 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  costs of revenues  accounts receivable  satellite network and other equipment  capitalized development costs  intangible assets  debt issuance costs and debt discount  convertible redeemable preferred stock  valuation of deferred tax assets  uncertain tax positions and the value of securities underlying stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their nature  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates and could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our revenue recognition policy requires us to make significant judgments regarding the probability of collection of the resulting accounts receivable balance based on prior history and the creditworthiness of our customers 
in instances where collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is recognized when we receive cash from the customer 
revenues generated from the sale of satellite subscriber communicators  and other products are either recognized when the products are shipped or when customers accept the products  depending on the specific contractual terms 
sales of satellite subscriber communicators and other items are not subject to return and title and risk of loss pass to the customer at the time of shipment 
sales of sims are subject to return and title and risk of loss pass to the customer at the time of shipment as we do not have a sufficient historical experience which to make a 
table of contents reasonable estimate of sims returns that will occur  revenue on the sales of sims is deferred until the return privilege has substantially expired 
sales of subscriber communicators and sims are primarily to vars and ivars and are not bundled with service arrangements 
revenues from sales of gateway earth stations and related products are recognized only upon installation  customer acceptance and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from the activation of subscriber communicators and sims are initially recorded as deferred revenues and are  thereafter  recognized ratably over the term of the agreement with the customer  generally three years 
revenues generated from monthly usage and administrative fees and engineering services are recognized when the services are rendered 
revenues generated from royalties under our subscriber communicator manufacturing agreements are recognized when we issue to a third party manufacturer upon request a unique serial number to be assigned to each unit manufactured by such third party manufacturer 
amounts received prior to the performance of services under customer contracts are recognized as deferred revenues and revenue recognition is deferred until such time that all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
for arrangements with multiple obligations eg  deliverable and undeliverable products  and other post contract support  we allocate revenues to each component of the contract based upon objective evidence of each component s fair value 
we recognize revenues allocated to undelivered products when the criteria for product revenues set forth above are met 
if objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered obligations is not available  the arrangement consideration allocable to a delivered item is combined with the amount allocable to the undelivered item s within the arrangement 
revenues are recognized as the remaining obligations are fulfilled 
out of pocket expenses incurred during the performance of professional service contracts are included in costs of services and any amounts re billed to clients are included in revenues during the period in which they are incurred 
shipping costs billed to customers are included in product sales revenues and the related costs are included as costs of product sales 
under our agreement with the us coast guard with respect to the concept validation project and related services described under overview revenues  the deliverables do not qualify as separate units of accounting and as a result  revenues from the agreement will be recognized ratably commencing upon the launch of the demonstration satellite expected in over the expected life of the customer relationship 
we  on occasion  issue options to purchase our equity securities or the equity securities of our subsidiaries  or issue shares of our common stock as an incentive in soliciting sales commitments from our customers 
the grant date fair value of such equity instruments is recorded as a reduction of revenues on a pro rata basis as products or services are delivered under the sales arrangement 
costs of product sales and services costs of product sales includes the purchase price of products sold  shipping charges  payroll and payroll related costs including stock based compensation for employees who are directly associated with fulfilling product sales and depreciation and amortization of assets used to deliver products 
costs of services is comprised of payroll and related costs  including stock based compensation  materials and supplies  depreciation and amortization of assets used to provide services 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are due in accordance with payment terms included in our negotiated contracts 
amounts due are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts that are outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
we make ongoing assumptions and judgments relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable to determine our required allowances based on a number of factors such as the age of the receivable  credit history of the customer  historical experience and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
past experience may not be indicative of future collections  as a result  allowances for doubtful accounts may deviate from our estimates as a percentage of accounts receivable and sales 

table of contents satellite network and other equipment satellite network and other equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
we use judgment to determine the useful life of our satellite network based on the estimated operational life of the satellites and periodic reviews of engineering data relating to the operation and performance of our satellite network 
satellite network includes the costs of our constellation of satellites  and the ground and control segments  which consists of gateway earth stations  gateway control centers and the network control center the ground segment 
assets under construction primarily consists of costs relating to the design  development and launch of the coast guard demonstration satellite  payload  bus and launch procurement agreements for our quick launch satellites and other related costs  design of the next generation satellites and upgrades to our infrastructure and ground segment 
once these assets are placed in service they will be transferred to satellite network and other equipment and then depreciation and amortization will be recognized using the straight line method over the estimated lives of the assets 
no depreciation has been charged on these assets as of december  long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets  including license rights  under the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
management reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
in connection with this review  we reevaluate the periods of depreciation and amortization 
we recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be realized from the asset is less than its carrying amount 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value  which is determined using the projected discounted future net cash flows 
we measure fair value by discounting estimated future net cash flows using an appropriate discount rate 
considerable judgment by the company is necessary to estimate the fair value of the assets and accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
our most significant estimates and judgments relating to the long lived asset impairments include the timing and amount of projected future cash flows and the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in future cash flows 
capitalized development costs judgments and estimates occur in the calculation of capitalized development costs 
we evaluate and estimate when a preliminary project stage is completed and at the point when the project is substantially complete and ready for use 
we base our estimates and evaluations on engineering data 
we capitalize the costs of acquiring  developing and testing software to meet our internal needs 
capitalization of costs associated with software obtained or developed for internal use commences when both the preliminary project stage is completed and management has authorized further funding for the project  based on a determination that it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended 
capitalized costs include only external direct cost of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use software  and payroll and payroll related costs for employees who are directly associated with  and devote time to  the internal use software project 
capitalization of such costs ceases no later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
internal use software costs are amortized once the software is placed in service using the straight line method over periods ranging from three to five years 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas 
under these guidelines  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect 
table of contents on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
judgment is applied in determining whether the recoverability of our deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
a valuation allowance is established for the amount of deferred tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
realization of our deferred tax assets may depend upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
based upon this analysis  we established a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets  except for an unrecognized tax benefit of million 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin an interpretation of sfas this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties and disclosures of matters related to uncertainty in income taxes  the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with this interpretation is a two step process 
in the first step  recognition  we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step addresses measurement of a tax position that meets the more likely than not criteria 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in an increase in a liability for income taxes payable or a reduction of an income tax refund receivable  or a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability or both 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be de recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
accounting for uncertainties in income taxes positions under fin involves significant judgments by management 
as of january   we had no significant unrecognized tax benefits 
during the year ended december   we recognized adjustments for uncertain tax benefits totaling million 
due to the existence of our valuation allowance the uncertain tax benefits if recognized would not impact our effective income tax rate 
we are subject to us federal and state examinations by tax authorities for all years since its inception 
we do not expect any significant changes to its unrecognized tax positions during the next twelve months 
loss contingencies we accrue for costs relating to litigation  claims and other contingent matters when such liabilities become probable and reasonably estimable 
such estimates may be based on advice from third parties or on management s judgment  as appropriate 
actual amounts paid may differ from amounts estimated  and such differences will be charged to operations in the period in which the final determination of the liability is made 
management considers the assessment of loss contingencies as a critical accounting policy because of the significant uncertainty relating to the outcome of any potential legal actions and other claims and the difficulty of predicting the likelihood and range of the potential liability involved  coupled with the material impact on our results of operations that could result from legal actions or other claims and assessments 
share based compensation our share based compensation plans consist of the long term incentives plan the ltip and the stock option plan 
the long term incentives plan  approved by our stockholders in september  provides for the grants of non qualified stock options  stock appreciation rights sars  common stock  restricted stock  restricted stock units rsus  performance units and performance shares to our employees and non employee directors the stock option plan  adopted in  provides for the grants of non qualified and incentive stock options to officers  directors  employees and consultants 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method using the black scholes option pricing model as the most appropriate 
table of contents model for determining the estimated fair value for all share based payment awards 
under that transition method  stock based compensation expense recognized subsequent to january  includes stock based compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and stock based compensation expense for all share based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value  estimated in accordance with provisions of sfas r 
sfas r requires us to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards based on estimated fair values 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
for awards with performance conditions  we make an evaluation at the grant date and future periods as to the likelihood of the performance targets being met 
compensation expense is adjusted in future periods for subsequent changes in the expected outcome of the performance conditions until the vesting date 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
prior to january   stock based compensation arrangements with our employees have been accounted for in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  using the intrinsic value method of accounting which requires charges to stock based compensation expense for the excess  if any  of the fair value of the underlying stock at the date an employee stock option is granted or at an appropriate subsequent measurement date over the amount the employee must pay to acquire the stock 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized million million and million of stock based compensation expense  respectively 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million of unrecognized compensation costs for all share based payment arrangements 
we expect that our planned use of share based payment arrangements will continue to be a significant expense for us in future periods 
we have not recognized  and do not expect to recognize in the near future  any tax benefit related to employee stock based compensation expense as a result of the full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets and net operating loss carryforwards 
the grant date fair value of the performance and time based rsu awards granted in is based upon the closing stock price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the grant date fair value of the time and performance based rsus granted in was determined to be per common share  the price of our common stock sold in our initial public offering the fair value of each time and performance based sar award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the assumptions described below for the periods indicated 
expected volatility was based on the stock volatility for comparable publicly traded companies 
we use the simplified method based on the average of the vesting term and the contractual term to calculate the expected life of each sar award 
estimated forfeitures were based on voluntary and involuntary termination behavior as well as analysis of actual sar forfeitures 
the risk free interest rate was based on the us treasury yield curve at the time of the grant over the expected term of the sar grants 
years ended december  risk free interest rate expected life years to estimated volatility expected dividends none none 
table of contents stock option plan in  we did not grant any stock options 
in february  we granted an option to an employee to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the fair value of the share based award was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions expected volatility of based on the stock volatility for comparable publicly traded companies  estimated fair value of our common stock on the date of grant of per share  expected life of the option of four years  giving consideration to the contractual term and vesting schedule  risk free interest rate of based on the us treasury yield curve at the time of the grant over the expected term of the stock option grant  and zero dividend yield 
the exercise price of these options was per share and the estimated fair value of these options was per share 
we determined the fair value of our common stock underlying stock options issued in february to be per share 
at the time options were issued in february  we concluded that the fair value of our common stock had increased significantly to per share  as a result of the completion of the series b preferred stock financing  recent developments in our business  our projected financial performance and the commencement of the process for our initial public offering  which was completed in in reaching our conclusion  we took into account a number of factors  including i the conversion price of our series b preferred stock issued in december and january  after giving effect to the for reverse stock split effected in october  ii our improved liquidity due to the receipt of net proceeds from the series b preferred stock financing  resulting in cash and cash equivalents of over million in the beginning of  which would permit us to continue to fund working capital and a portion of our capital expenditure plan  iii recent business developments which we believed improved our operations and prospects  including substantial net increases in billable subscriber communicators activated on our system during the fourth quarter of and the beginning of the first quarter of and customer wins with large resellers such as ge equipment services  iv the then current and projected increases in our revenues and gross margins  v preliminary estimated price ranges related to the commencement of our process for our initial public offering completed in november  and vi a discounted cash flow analysis of our projected financial results 
we also considered the following factors in assessing the fair value the fact that our common stock was an illiquid security of a private company without a trading market  the likelihood of a liquidity event  such as an initial public offering  and potential risks and uncertainties in our business 
we made such determination by considering a number of factors including the conversion price of our series a and b preferred stock issued december and january  recent business developments  a discounted cash flow analysis of its projected financial results  and preliminary estimated price ranges related to the commencement of our process for a potential public offering 
we did not obtain a contemporaneous valuation from an unrelated valuation specialist 
determining the fair value of our common stock requires making complex and subjective judgments and is subject to assumptions and uncertainties 
we believe that we have used reasonable methodologies  approaches and assumptions consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants practice guide  valuation of privately held company equity securities issued as compensation to determine the fair value of our common stock

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we do not have any material interest rate risk 
effects of inflation risk overall  we believe that the impact of inflation risk on our business will not be significant 
foreign currency risk we expect that an increasing percentage of our revenues will be derived from sources outside of the united states  which will subject us to foreign currency risk 
the majority of our existing contracts require our customers to pay us in us dollars 
however  our licensees  country representatives and resellers generally derive their revenues from their customers outside of the united states in local currencies 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and such local currencies could make the cost of our services uneconomic for our customers and we may be required to reduce our rates to make the cost of our services economical in certain markets 
in addition  currency controls  trade restrictions and other disruptions in the currency convertibility or foreign currency exchange markets could negatively impact the ability of our customers to obtain us dollars with which to pay our fees 
it is also possible in the future that we may not be able to contractually require that our service fees be paid in us dollars in which case we will be exposed to foreign currency risks directly 
concentration of credit risk our customers are primarily commercial organizations headquartered in the united states 
accounts receivable are generally unsecured 
in  and  one customer  ge equipment services accounted for  and of our revenues  respectively 
we have no bad debt expense from this customer 
in  we recognized million  or of our consolidated revenues  upon installation of a gateway earth station sold pursuant to a contract entered into with leosat llp in vendor risk currently  substantially all of our subscriber communicators are manufactured by a contract manufacturer  delphi automotive systems llc  a subsidiary of delphi corporation  which is under bankruptcy protection 
our communicators are manufactured by a delphi affiliate in mexico  which we do not believe will be impacted by the delphi bankruptcy 
market rate risk as of december   included in cash and cash equivalents are us treasury securities totaling million 
the primary objectives of our investment activities are to preserve capital  maintain sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements while at the same time maximizing income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing our risk 
due to the high investment quality and short duration of these us treasury securities  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair value as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however will reduce future income 
a hypothetical movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on interest income
