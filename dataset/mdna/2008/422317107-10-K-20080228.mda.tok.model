executive summary hearst argyle television  inc and its subsidiaries hereafter we or the company own and operate network affiliated television stations 
additionally  we provide management services to two network affiliated stations and one independent television station and two radio stations owned by the hearst corporation hearst in exchange for management fees 
we also seek to attract our television audience by providing compelling content on multiple media platforms 
we provide leading local news programming and popular network and syndicated programs at each of our television stations  of which are in the top us television markets 
in addition  we seek to make our content available to our audience as they use additional content platforms  such as the internet and portable devices  during their day 
we stream a portion of our television programming  including our news and weather forecasts  and we publish community information  user generated content and entertainment content on our stations websites 
in many of our markets  we have also established a mobile presence for our stations websites 
we believe that aligning our content offerings with audience media consumption patterns in this manner ultimately benefits our advertisers 
our advertisers benefit from a variety of marketing opportunities  including traditional spot campaigns  community events and sponsorships at our television stations  as well as on our stations internet and or mobile websites  enabling them to reach our audience in multiple ways 
events and other factors that have influenced our results the housing downturn has impacted certain of the company s largest markets and contributed to the slowdown in consumer purchases of autos  financial services and furniture and housewares  resulting in a reduction of advertising expenditures in these three important categories 
results for the year ended december  reflect a million decrease in net political advertising revenue resulting from the normal  cyclical nature of the television broadcasting business  partially offset by an increase in advertising revenue resulting from our acquisition of wkcf tv on august  for the year ended december   the company recorded digital media revenue and associated expenses of million and million  respectively  reflecting our continued focus on digital media 
on august   hearst broadcasting  inc  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of hearst  announced its intentions to launch  and on september   launched  a tender offer to acquire the outstanding shares of the company s series a common stock that it did not already own the offer 
on october   the offer expired and hearst announced that it would return to shareholders all of the shares that were tendered in the offer 
for the year ended december   the company recognized million of expense related to the offer 
at december   total debt was million  a decrease of million from december  on january   the company adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin which resulted in a decrease to retained earnings of million  a million decrease to deferred income tax liability and a million increase to other liabilities 
industry trends political advertising decreases in odd numbered years  such as due to the change in the timing of the election primaries in certain of our markets  political advertising was greater in the fourth quarter of than is typical in an odd numbered year 
revenue from olympic advertising occurs exclusively in even numbered years  such as  with the alternating winter and summer games occurring every two years 
consequently  our nbc stations aired the winter olympics in february and did not record any advertising revenue associated with the olympics in the federal communications commission fcc has permitted broadcast television station licensees to use their digital spectrum for a wide variety of services such as high definition television programming  audio  data and other types of communication  subject to the requirement that each broadcaster provide at least one free video channel equal in quality to the current technical standards 
our nbc stations currently broadcast the weather plus network  a local and national weather broadcast network  on a multicast stream in addition to their main digital channels 
in addition  six of our other stations have launched similar station branded multicast weather channels 
compensation from networks to their affiliates in exchange for broadcasting of network programming has been sharply reduced in recent years and may be eliminated in the future 
pursuant to the cable television consumer protection and competition act of cable act and the fcc s must carry regulations  cable operators are generally required to devote up to one third of their activated channel capacity to the carriage of the analog signal of local commercial television stations 
on a cable system by cable system basis  a local television broadcast station must choose once every three years whether to waive the right to mandatory  but uncompensated  carriage and  instead  to negotiate a grant of retransmission consent 
we opted to negotiate retransmission consent with most of the cable systems that carry our stations and we record income from most of these relationships 
the satellite home viewer improvement act of shvia established a compulsory copyright licensing system for the distribution of local television station signals by direct broadcast satellite systems to viewers in each dma 
under shvia s carry one  carry all provision  a direct broadcast satellite system generally is required to retransmit the analog signal of all local television stations in a dma if the system chooses to retransmit the analog signal of any local television station in that dma 
television stations located in markets in which satellite carriage of local stations is offered may elect mandatory carriage or retransmission consent once every three years 
we opted to negotiate retransmission consent for all satellite systems that carry our stations and we record income from most of these relationships 
legislation that guides the transition from analog to digital television broadcasting includes a deadline of february  for completion of the transition to digital broadcasting and the return of the analog spectrum to the government 
as a result  the company accelerated the depreciation of certain equipment that may have a shorter useful life as a result of the digital conversion 
in sprint nextel corporation nextel was granted the right from the fcc to claim from broadcasters in each market across the country the ghz spectrum to use for an emergency communications system 
in order to reclaim this signal  nextel must replace all analog equipment currently using this spectrum with digital equipment 
all broadcasters have agreed to use the digital substitute that nextel will provide 
the transition will be completed on a market by market basis 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million gain which primarily represents the difference between the fair market value of the equipment we received and the book value of the analog equipment we exchanged 
as the equipment is exchanged in other markets  we expect to record additional gains 
critical accounting policies and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts  program rights  barter and trade transactions  useful lives of property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  carrying value of investments  accrued liabilities  contingent liabilities  income taxes  pension benefits  and fair value of financial instruments and stock options 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions  which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
had we used different assumptions in determining our estimates  our reported results may have varied 
the different types of estimates that are required to be made by us in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements vary significantly in the level of subjectivity involved in their determination 
we have identified the estimates below as those which contain a relatively high level of subjectivity in their determination and  therefore  could have a more material effect upon our reported results if different assumptions were used 
impairment testing of intangible assets in performing our annual impairment testing of goodwill and fcc licenses  which are both considered to be intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  we must make a significant number of assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value based on the present value of future cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the assumptions and estimates required under the impairment testing of goodwill and fcc licenses include future market revenue growth  operating profit margins  perpetual growth rates  market revenue share  and weighted average cost of capital  among others 
for the years ended december  and  estimates of the present value of future cash flows for our stations exceeded the book value of our fcc licenses and goodwill indicating no impairment of these assets 
pension assumptions in computing projected benefit obligations and the resulting pension expense  we are required to make a number of assumptions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
to compute our projected benefit obligations as of the measurement date of september   we used the discount rate of and an average rate of compensation increase of 
in determining the discount rate assumption of  we used a measurement date of september  and constructed a portfolio of bonds to match the benefit payment stream that is projected to be paid from the company s pension plans 
the benefit payment stream is assumed to be funded from bond coupons and maturities as well as interest on the excess cash flows from the bond portfolio 
to compute our pension expense in the year ended december   we assumed a discount rate of  an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of  and an average rate of compensation increase of 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on management s methodology for developing the expected long term rate of return assumption 
we consider the assumptions used in our determination of our projected benefit obligations and pension expense to be reasonable 
pension assumptions sensitivity analysis the weighted average assumptions used in computing our net pension expense and projected benefit obligation have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point change in each of the assumptions below would have the following effects upon net pension expense and projected benefit obligation  respectively  in the year ended and as of december  one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease discount rate expected long term rate of return rate of compensation increase discount rate expected long term rate of return rate of compensation increase in thousands net pension benefit expense      projected benefit obligation  n a   n a income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the differences in the book and tax basis of certain assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion  or all of the deferred tax assets  will not be realized 
our estimates of income taxes and the significant items giving rise to deferred assets and liabilities are shown in note and reflect our assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items reflected in the consolidated financial statements  giving consideration to both timing and probability 
actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law or reviews by federal and state tax authorities 
we have considered these potential changes in accordance with sfas and financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which requires the company to record reserves for estimates of probable settlements of federal and state audits 
accordingly the company has included million in other liabilities non current and million in accrued liabilities current on our consolidated balance sheet 
the results of audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues and future income tax expense 
income tax expense was million or of pre tax income in our consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  deferred tax assets were approximately million and deferred tax liabilities were approximately million as of december  investment carrying values we have investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which are accounted for under the equity method if our equity interest is from to  and under the cost method if our equity interest is less than and we do not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies 
we review the carrying value of investments on an ongoing basis and adjust them to reflect fair value  where necessary 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as part of our analysis and determination of the fair value of investments  we must make assumptions and estimates regarding expected future cash flows  which involve assessing the financial results  forecasts  and strategic direction of each company 
during the year ended december   the company wrote off its investment of million in usdtv 
we consider the assumptions used in our determination of investment carrying values to be reasonable
