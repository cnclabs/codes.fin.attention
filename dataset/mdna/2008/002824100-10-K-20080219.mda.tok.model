item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial review abbott s revenues are derived primarily from the sale of a broad line of health care products under short term receivable arrangements 
patent protection and licenses  technological and performance features  and inclusion of abbott s products under a contract or by a pharmacy benefit manager most impact which products are sold  price controls  competition and rebates most impact the net selling prices of products  and foreign currency translation impacts the measurement of net sales and costs 
abbott s primary products are prescription pharmaceuticals  nutritional products  diagnostic testing products and vascular products 
abbott also owns percent of tap pharmaceutical products inc that abbott accounts for on the equity method 
the worldwide launch of additional indications of humira  the acquisitions of guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and kos pharmaceuticals inc  the amendments ending the boehringer ingelheim agreement and the synagis co promotion agreement  the loss of patent protection for some pharmaceutical products  and realized gains and unrealized losses on the boston scientific common stock have impacted abbott s sales  costs and financial position over the last three years 
pharmaceutical research and development is focused on therapeutic areas that include immunology  oncology  neuroscience  pain management  and infectious diseases 
in  abbott began the worldwide launch of humira for rheumatoid arthritis  followed by launches for three additional indications  which increased humira s worldwide sales to billion in compared to billion in  and billion in including the launch of a fifth indication in  abbott forecasts worldwide humira sales of approximately billion in substantial research and development and selling support has been and continues to be dedicated to maximizing the worldwide potential of humira 
in december  abbott acquired kos pharmaceuticals inc which complements abbott s existing franchise in the dyslipidemia market and strengthened the pharmaceutical pipeline for cholesterol management 
in  abbott and boehringer ingelheim bi amended their agreement whereby abbott distributed and promoted bi products 
effective january   abbott no longer distributed or recorded sales for distribution activities for the bi products 
abbott s gross margins for bi products from the prior agreement in effect through december  were substantially lower than its average gross margins 
sales of bi products were million and billion in and  respectively 
in addition  increased generic competition resulted in us sales of omnicef declining from million in to million in  and worldwide sales of clarithromycin declining from billion in to million in on december   the us co promotion agreement for synagis terminated 
revenues for co promotion of synagis were million in abbott s nutritional products businesses have been reorganized into a worldwide business to better leverage the opportunities available for strong nutritional brands 
significant efforts have been focused on capturing those opportunities  particularly in developing markets where growth has been strong 
in april  abbott acquired guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and began to integrate it with abbott s vascular business 
the acquisition significantly improved abbott s competitive position in this business that is characterized by rapid innovation 
in  abbott received european union approval to market the xience v drug eluting stent  and abbott is awaiting approval in the us abbott s diagnostic segment comprises three separate divisions immunochemistry hematology  point of care  and molecular 
subsequent to the termination of the agreement to sell the immunochemistry hematology and point of care businesses to ge  abbott has re focused on managing and growing these businesses 
abbott acquired million shares of boston scientific in connection with abbott s acquisition of the vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses of guidant 
in  the net loss charged to expense for the investment was million 
at december   abbott held million shares of boston scientific common stock 
subsequent to year end  all of these shares were sold resulting in a small gain 
abbott s short and long term debt totaled billion at december   largely incurred to finance recent acquisitions 
operating cash flows in excess of capital expenditures and cash dividends have partially funded acquisitions over the last three years 
at december   abbott s long term debt rating was aa by standard and poor s corporation and a by moody s investors service 
in  abbott will focus on several key initiatives 
in the pharmaceutical business  abbott will continue the launch of newly approved indications for humira and continue to leverage the product and pipeline opportunities of its lipid franchise  including the kos pharmaceuticals inc business 
pharmaceutical research and development efforts will continue to focus on the therapeutic areas noted above with a significant portion of the development expenditures allocated to new humira indications  as well as simcor and abt  cholesterol drugs  abt crestor fixed dose combination  abt  a biologic for psoriasis and crohn s disease  and controlled release vicodin cr  as well as several phase i and phase ii clinical programs in neuroscience and oncology 
in the vascular business  abbott will continue the launch of the xience v drug eluting stent internationally  and will launch in the us upon approval by the fda 
for diabetes care  abbott anticipates launching the freestyle freedom lite monitor in the us as well as the freestyle navigator 
in the other business segments  abbott will focus on developing or acquiring differentiated technologies in higher growth segments of those markets 
critical accounting policies sales rebates approximately percent of abbott s consolidated gross revenues are subject to various forms of rebates and allowances that abbott records as reductions of revenues at the time of sale 
most of these rebates and allowances are in the pharmaceutical products segment and the nutritional products segment 
abbott provides rebates to pharmacy benefit management companies  to state agencies that administer the federal medicaid and medicare programs and the special supplemental food program for women  infants  and children wic  wholesalers  group purchasing organizations  and other government agencies and private entities 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases using contractual or statutory prices for a product 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of which products have been sold subject to a rebate  which customer or government agency price terms apply  and the estimated lag time between sale and payment of a rebate 
using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  abbott estimates the amount of the rebate that will be paid  and records the liability as a reduction of gross sales when abbott records its sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from two to months after sale 
abbott regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
rebates and chargebacks charged against gross sales in  and amounted to approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  or percent  percent  and percent  respectively  based on gross sales of approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  subject to rebate 
a one percentage point increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales would decrease net sales and operating earnings by approximately million in abbott considers a one percentage point increase to be a reasonably likely increase in the percentage of rebates to related gross sales 
other allowances charged against gross sales were approximately million  million and million for cash discounts in  and  respectively  and million  million and million for returns in  and  respectively 
cash discounts are known within to days of sale  and therefore can be reliably estimated 
returns can be reliably estimated because abbott s historical returns are low  and because sales returns terms and other sales terms have remained relatively unchanged for several periods 
management analyzes the adequacy of ending rebate accrual balances each quarter 
in the domestic nutritional business  management uses both internal and external data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel 
management has access to several large customers inventory management systems  and for other customers  utilizes data from a third party that continuously measures time on the retail shelf 
these sources allow management to make reliable estimates of inventory in the distribution channel 
except for a transition period before or after a change in the supplier for the wic business in a state  inventory in the distribution channel does not vary substantially 
management also estimates the states processing lag time based on claims data 
in addition  internal processing time is a factor in estimating the accrual 
in the wic business  the state where the sale is made  which is the determining factor for the applicable price  is reliably determinable 
estimates are required for the amount of wic sales within each state where abbott has the wic business 
external data sources utilized for that estimate are participant data from the us department of agriculture usda  which administers the wic program  participant data from some of the states  and internally administered market surveys 
the usda has been making its data available for many years 
internal data includes historical redemption rates and pricing data 
at december   abbott had the exclusive wic business in states 
in the domestic pharmaceutical business  the most significant charges against gross sales are for medicaid and medicare rebates  pharmacy benefit manager rebates and wholesaler chargebacks 
in order to evaluate the adequacy of the ending accrual balances  management uses both internal and external estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution channel and the rebate claims processing lag time 
external data sources used to estimate the inventory in the distribution channel include inventory levels periodically reported by wholesalers and third party market data purchased by abbott 
management estimates the processing lag time based on periodic sampling of claims data 
to estimate the price rebate percentage  systems and calculations are used to track sales by product by customer and to estimate the contractual or statutory price 
abbott s systems and calculations have developed over time as rebates have become more significant  and abbott believes they are reliable 
the following table is an analysis of the four largest rebate accruals  which comprise approximately percent of the consolidated rebate provisions charged against revenues in remaining rebate provisions charged against gross sales are not significant in the determination of operating earnings 
dollars in thousands domestic pharmaceutical products domestic nutritionals wic rebates medicaid and medicare rebates pharmacy benefit manager rebates wholesaler chargebacks balance at january     provisions     payments     balance at december     provisions     payments     business combination    balance at december     provisions     payments     balance at december     historically  adjustments to prior years rebate accruals have not been material to net income 
in  adjustments were made to prior years rebate accruals 
the medicaid and medicare rebate accrual was reduced by approximately million and the wic rebate accrual was increased by approximately million 
abbott employs various techniques to verify the accuracy of claims submitted to it  and where possible  works with the organizations submitting claims to gain insight into changes that might affect the rebate amounts 
for medicaid  medicare and other government agency programs  the calculation of a rebate involves interpretations of relevant regulations  which are subject to challenge or change in interpretation 
income taxes abbott operates in numerous countries where its income tax returns are subject to audits and adjustments 
because abbott operates globally  the nature of the audit items are often very complex  and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same income in more than one country 
abbott employs internal and external tax professionals to minimize audit adjustment amounts where possible 
on january   abbott adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which changed the measurement of tax contingencies 
under this interpretation  in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit  the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position  and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit 
application of this interpretation requires a significant amount of judgment 
in the us  abbott s federal income tax returns through are settled  and the income tax returns for years after are open 
abbott does not record deferred income taxes on earnings reinvested indefinitely in foreign subsidiaries 
pension and post employment benefits abbott offers pension benefits and post employment health care to many of its employees 
abbott engages outside actuaries to calculate its obligations and costs under these programs 
abbott must develop long term assumptions  the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates  discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
the discount rates used to measure liabilities were determined based on high quality fixed income securities that match the duration of the expected retiree benefits 
the health care cost trend rates represent abbott s expected annual rates of change in the cost of health care benefits and is a forward projection of health care costs as of the measurement date 
a difference between the assumed rates and the actual rates  which will not be known for decades  can be significant in relation to the obligations and the annual cost recorded for these programs 
recent low interest rates have significantly increased actuarial losses for these plans 
at december   pretax net actuarial losses and prior service costs and credits recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income loss for abbott s defined benefit plans and medical and dental plans were million and million  respectively 
actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method  in accordance with the rules for accounting for post employment benefits 
differences between the expected long term return on plan assets and the actual annual return are amortized over a five year period 
footnote to the consolidated financial statements describes the impact of a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate  however  there can be no certainty that a change would be limited to only one percentage point 
on december   abbott adopted the provisions of sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
the provisions of this statement require the recognition of the deferrals on the balance sheet with a corresponding charge to accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
adoption of this statement on december  resulted in a decrease in abbott s shareholders equity of approximately billion 
valuation of intangible assets abbott has acquired and continues to acquire significant intangible assets that abbott records at fair value 
those assets which do not yet have regulatory approval and for which there are no alternative uses are expensed as acquired in process research and development  and those that have regulatory approval are capitalized 
transactions involving the purchase or sale of intangible assets occur with some frequency between companies in the health care field and valuations are usually based on a discounted cash flow analysis 
the discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash inflows  risk  the cost of capital  terminal values and market participants 
each of these factors can significantly affect the value of the intangible asset 
abbott engages independent valuation experts who review abbott s critical assumptions and calculations for significant acquisitions of intangibles 
abbott reviews intangible assets for impairment each quarter using an undiscounted net cash flows approach 
if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  the intangible asset is written down to its fair value  which is usually the discounted cash flow amount 
where cash flows cannot be identified for an individual asset  the review is applied at the lowest group level for which cash flows are identifiable 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually or when an event that could result in an impairment of goodwill occurs 
at december   goodwill and intangibles amounted to billion and billion  respectively  and amortization expense for intangible assets amounted to million in there were no impairments of goodwill in  or litigation abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
under sfas no 
 loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management s best estimate of a loss  or when a best estimate cannot be made  a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period as additional information becomes known 
accordingly  abbott is often initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  and therefore the minimum amount  which could be zero  is recorded 
as information becomes known  either the minimum loss amount is increased  resulting in additional loss provisions  or a best estimate can be made  also resulting in additional loss provisions 
occasionally  a best estimate amount is changed to a lower amount when events result in an expectation of a more favorable outcome than previously expected 
except for a patent case and the majority of cases relating to pharmaceutical pricing for which abbott is unable to estimate a loss  if any  abbott estimates the range of possible loss to be from approximately million to million for its legal proceedings and environmental exposures 
reserves of approximately million have been recorded at december  for these proceedings and exposures 
these reserves represent management s best estimate of probable loss  as defined by sfas no 
stock compensation on january   abbott adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires that fair value of stock options be recorded in the results of operations 
since there is no market for trading employee stock options  management must use a fair value method 
there is no certainty that the results of a fair value method would be the value at which employee stock options would be traded for cash 
fair value methods require management to make several assumptions  the most significant of which are the selection of a fair value model  stock price volatility and the average life of an option 
abbott has readily available grant by grant historical activity for several years in its option administration system that it uses in developing some of its assumptions 
abbott uses the black scholes method to value stock options 
the results of the black scholes model are periodically compared to the binomial model and the results have been comparable 
abbott uses both historical volatility of its stock price and the implied volatility of currently traded options to develop the volatility assumptions 
abbott uses the historical grant activity  combined with expectations about future exercise activity  to develop the average life assumptions 
abbott has also used the historical grant data to evaluate whether certain holders of stock options exercised their options differently than other holders and has not found any differentiating pattern among holders

worldwide sales compared to reflect the acquisitions of guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses on april  and kos pharmaceuticals inc in the fourth quarter of in addition  the pharmaceutical products segment had an agreement with boehringer ingelheim bi to co promote and distribute three of its products in the us in  abbott and bi amended the agreement and effective january   abbott no longer distributed or recorded sales for distribution activities for the bi products although abbott recorded a small amount of co promotion revenue in the increases in sales for excluding bi products were percent for total net sales  percent for total us sales and percent for pharmaceutical products segment sales 
sales growth in for the nutritional products segment reflects the completion of the us co promotion of synagis in excluding sales of synagis in  nutritional products segment sales increased percent 
a comparison of significant product group sales is as follows 
percent changes are versus the prior year and are based on unrounded numbers 
percent change percent change percent change dollars in millions pharmaceuticals us specialty us primary care    international pharmaceuticals    nutritionals us pediatric nutritionals international pediatric nutritionals  us adult nutritionals    international adult nutritionals diagnostics immunochemistry increased sales volume of humira and increased volume and price for depakote favorably impacted us specialty sales 
us primary care sales in were favorably impacted by sales of niaspan  a new product from the acquisition of kos pharmaceuticals inc in the fourth quarter of in addition  increased sales volume for omnicef in and and increased sales of tricor in all three years favorably impacted us primary care sales 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales of omnicef in and lower us sales of biaxin in all three years due primarily to the introduction of generic competition 
us sales of omnicef were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and us sales of biaxin were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
increased sales volume of humira favorably impacted international pharmaceuticals sales  partially offset by decreased sales volume in due to generic competition for clarithromycin 
the decrease in sales of us pediatric nutritionals in was primarily due to overall infant nutritionals non wic category decline and competitive share loss 
international pediatric nutritionals sales increases were due primarily to volume growth in developing countries 
us adult nutritionals sales in were favorably impacted by the acquisition of eas in the fourth quarter of international sales in were also favorably impacted by the effect of the relatively weaker us dollar 
abbott has periodically sold product rights to non strategic products and has recorded the related gains in net sales in accordance with abbott s revenue recognition policies as discussed in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
related net sales were million in  million in and million in the expiration of licenses  patent protection and generic competition can affect the future revenues and operating income of abbott 
significant ongoing generic activities and significant patent and license expirations in the next three years are as follows 
the us composition of matter patent for depakote expires in july of abbott holds non composition of matter patents on the extended release form of depakote 
us sales of depakote were billion in the pharmaceutical products segment markets depakote 
some patents under license in the vascular products segment related to rapid exchange technology expire in  however the impact is not expected to be material 
the patent for prevacid  which is marketed by tap pharmaceuticals  expires in operating earnings gross profit margins were percent of net sales in  percent in and percent in the decrease in the gross profit margin in was due  in part  to the effect of the unfavorable impact in of the completion of the us co promotion of synagis in as well as generic competition for omnicef and biaxin sales in increased amortization of intangible assets acquired in also had an unfavorable impact on the gross profit margins in the increase in the gross profit margin in was due to favorable product mix  primarily as a result of decreased sales of boehringer ingelheim products that had lower margins than other products in the pharmaceutical products segment and the decrease in the gross profit margin in was due to unfavorable product mix  primarily as a result of increased sales of boehringer ingelheim products 
restructuring charges  discussed below  reduced the gross profit margins in  and by percentage points  percentage points and percentage points  respectively 
gross profit margins in all years were also affected by productivity improvements  higher commodity costs  higher project expenses for new products  higher manufacturing capacity costs for anticipated unit growth and the effects of inflation 
in the us  states receive price rebates from manufacturers of infant formula under the federally subsidized special supplemental food program for women  infants  and children 
there are also rebate programs for pharmaceutical products 
these rebate programs continue to have a negative effect on the gross profit margins of the nutritional and pharmaceutical products segments 
higher commodity costs unfavorably impacted the gross profit margins for the nutritional products segment in and pricing pressures unfavorably impacted the gross profit margins in and the gross profit margins for the pharmaceutical products segment were favorably impacted in and unfavorably impacted in by product mix 
the favorable product mix in was due to decreased sales of lower margin boehringer ingelheim products and the unfavorable impact on the gross profit margin in was due primarily to increased sales of lower margin boehringer ingelheim products and higher other manufacturing costs 
research and development expense  excluding acquired in process and collaborations research and development  was billion in  billion in and billion in and represented increases of percent in  percent in and percent in the effect of recording compensation expense relating to share based awards in and additional costs associated with abbott s decision to discontinue the commercial development of the zomaxx drug eluting stent increased research and development expenses by percentage points over the increases in and were also affected by the acquisitions of guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses in april and kos pharmaceuticals inc in the fourth quarter of these increases also reflect increased spending to support pipeline programs  including new indications for humira  and abt a cholesterol drug  abt crestor fixed dose combination  abt a biologic for psoriasis and crohn s disease  controlled release vicodin cr  xience v  as well as several phase i and phase ii clinical programs in neuroscience and oncology 
the majority of research and development expenditures are concentrated on pharmaceutical products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent in compared to increases of percent in and percent in the increase reflects the acquisitions of guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and kos pharmaceuticals inc the increase reflects recording compensation expense relating to share based awards  a philanthropic contribution to the abbott fund and the acquisition of guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses 
these items increased selling  general and administrative expenses by percentage points over the restructuring charges discussed below and an increase in a bad debt reserve associated with an unfavorable court ruling increased the percent change from by percentage points in the remaining increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were due primarily to increased selling and marketing support for new and existing products  including continued spending for humira and the continuing international launch of xience v  as well as spending on other marketed pharmaceutical products 
increases in all three years also reflect inflation and additional selling and marketing support primarily in the pharmaceutical products segment 
restructurings dollars in millions in  and  abbott management approved plans to realign its worldwide pharmaceutical and vascular manufacturing operations and selected domestic and international commercial and research and development operations in order to reduce costs

fair value for the determination of the amount of asset impairments was determined primarily based on a discounted cash flow method 
an additional  and were subsequently recorded in  and  respectively  relating to these restructurings  primarily for accelerated depreciation

taxes on earnings the income tax rates on earnings were percent in  percent in and percent in taxes on earnings in reflect the effect of the tax rates applied to acquired in process research and development and the resolution of prior years income tax audits and the effect of other discrete tax items 
for  the tax rates applied to acquired in process and collaborations research and development increased the effective tax rate by percentage points and the effect of the income tax audit resolution and other discrete tax items decreased the effective tax rate by percentage points 
in  abbott remitted billion of foreign earnings in accordance with the american jobs creation act of and recorded additional tax expense of million  which increased the effective tax rate by approximately percentage points 
this was partially offset by adjustments of prior years tax accounts resulting primarily from resolution of prior years accrual requirements  which decreased the effective tax rate by percentage points 
abbott expects to apply an annual effective rate of somewhat above percent in recently adopted accounting standards effective january   abbott adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  and sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on abbott s financial position 
however  adoption of sfas no 
and sfas no 
resulted in a decrease to earnings employed in the business of approximately million  substantially offset by an increase to accumulated other comprehensive income loss of approximately million as of january  effective january   abbott adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fasb interpretation no 
requires that a recorded tax benefit must be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by tax authorities based upon its technical merits 
the amount of benefit recorded is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on abbott s financial position 
business combinations  technology acquisitions and related transactions in december  abbott acquired kos pharmaceuticals inc for cash of approximately billion  net of cash held by kos pharmaceuticals inc  to expand abbott s presence in the lipid management market and to provide several on market and late stage pipeline products 
kos pharmaceuticals inc was a specialty pharmaceutical company that developed and marketed proprietary medications for the treatment of chronic cardiovascular  metabolic and respiratory diseases 
this business was acquired on december  and the financial results of the acquired operations are included in these financial statements beginning on that date 
the acquisition was financed primarily with short term debt 
the allocation of the purchase price resulted in a charge of billion for acquired in process research and development  intangible assets of million  goodwill primarily non deductible of billion and net liabilities  primarily deferred income taxes recorded at acquisition of million 
acquired intangible assets are being amortized over to years 
non deductible acquired in process research and development was charged to income in a substantial amount of the acquired in process research and development charge relating to the kos acquisition related primarily to cholesterol treatment drugs 
the research efforts ranged from percent to percent complete at the date of acquisition 
the valuation method used to fair value the projects was the multi period excess earnings method income approach and the risk adjusted discount rate used was percent 
in developing assumptions for the valuation model  comparable abbott products or products marketed by competitors were used to estimate pricing  margins and expense levels 
as of december   one drug was approved for marketing in the us and the remaining research efforts were primarily on schedule 
the estimated projected costs to complete the projects totaled approximately million as of december  with anticipated product launches from through there have been no significant changes in the development plans for the acquired incomplete projects 
significant net cash inflows will commence with the launches of the products 
in order to expand abbott s presence in the growing vascular market  abbott acquired guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses on april  for approximately billion  in cash  in connection with boston scientific s acquisition of guidant 
in addition  abbott will also pay to boston scientific million each upon government approvals to market the xience v drug eluting stent in the us and in japan 
government approvals are anticipated in for the us and in for japan 
each million payment will result in the recording of additional goodwill 
the allocation of the purchase price resulted in a charge of million for acquired in process research and development  intangible assets of billion  goodwill primarily deductible of billion and tangible net assets of million

the estimated projected costs to complete totaled approximately million as of december   with anticipated product launch dates from through there have been no significant changes in the development plans for the acquired incomplete projects 
significant net cash inflows will commence within one to two years after product launch 
in order to facilitate boston scientific s acquisition of guidant  abbott also acquired million shares of boston scientific common stock directly from boston scientific and loaned million to a wholly owned subsidiary of boston scientific 
the common stock was valued at billion and the note receivable was valued at million at the acquisition date 
in connection with the acquisition of the shares  boston scientific is entitled to certain after tax gains upon abbott s sale of the shares 
in addition  boston scientific agreed to reimburse abbott for certain borrowing costs on debt incurred to acquire the boston scientific shares 
abbott recorded a net derivative financial instruments liability of million for the gain sharing derivative financial instrument liability and the interest derivative financial instrument asset 
the effect of recording the shares  the loan to boston scientific and the derivative financial instruments at fair value on the date of acquisition resulted in the recording of additional goodwill of approximately million 
changes in the fair value of the derivative financial instruments  net are recorded in other income expense  net 
in  abbott acquired the remaining interest in a small medical products company and a less than percent equity interest in a small medical products company for million 
in  abbott also acquired additional rights related to humira for approximately million  which are being amortized over years 
had the above acquisitions taken place on january of the previous year  consolidated net sales and income would not have been significantly different from reported amounts 
financial condition cash flow net cash from operating activities amounted to billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
cash from operating activities in and compared to is higher due to higher net earnings adjusted for after tax non cash charges for acquired in process research and development in and share based compensation and higher contributions to retirement benefit plans in compared to and  partially offset by higher income tax payments in  including tax payments related to the remittances of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation act 
abbott funds its domestic pension plans according to irs funding limitations 
in and  million was funded to the main domestic pension plan and in  million was funded to the main domestic pension plan 
abbott expects pension funding for its main domestic pension plan of million annually 
the increased contribution in was due  in part  to the investment of cash remitted under the american jobs creation act of abbott expects annual cash flow from operating activities to continue to exceed abbott s capital expenditures and cash dividends 
debt and capital at december   abbott s long term debt rating was aa by standard poor s corporation and a by moody s investors service 
abbott has readily available financial resources  including unused lines of credit of billion that support commercial paper borrowing arrangements 
these lines of credit expire in in october  the board of directors authorized the purchase of billion of abbott s common shares from time to time and no shares were purchased under this authorization in in  abbott purchased approximately million of its common shares at a cost of approximately billion 
in and  abbott purchased approximately million and million  respectively  of its common shares under prior authorizations at a cost of approximately million and billion  respectively 
under a registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission in february  abbott issued billion of long term debt in that matures in through with interest rates ranging from percent to percent 
proceeds from this debt were used to pay down short term borrowings that were incurred to partially fund the acquisition of kos pharmaceuticals inc under the same registration statement  abbott issued billion of long term debt in that matures in through with interest rates ranging from percent to percent 
proceeds from this debt were used to pay down domestic commercial paper borrowings that were incurred to partially fund the acquisition of guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses 
in addition  commercial paper borrowings were used to repay billion of long term debt in in  abbott borrowed billion of long term debt that was scheduled to mature in may with variable interest rates above libor 
in and  million and billion  respectively  of this debt was paid prior to maturity 
working capital working capital was billion at december  and billion at december  at december   current liabilities exceeded current assets by approximately million as a result of increased short term borrowings used to acquire kos pharmaceuticals inc in december capital expenditures capital expenditures of billion in  billion in and billion in were principally for upgrading and expanding manufacturing  research and development  investments in information technology and administrative support facilities in all segments  and for laboratory instruments placed with customers

contingent obligations abbott has periodically entered into agreements in the ordinary course of business  such as assignment of product rights  with other companies which has resulted in abbott becoming secondarily liable for obligations that abbott was previously primarily liable 
since abbott no longer maintains a business relationship with the other parties  abbott is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments  if any  under these obligations 
based upon past experience  the likelihood of payments under these agreements is remote 
in addition  abbott periodically acquires a business or product rights in which abbott agrees to pay contingent consideration based on attaining certain thresholds or based on the occurrence of certain events

abbott s primary markets are highly competitive and subject to substantial government regulation throughout the world 
abbott expects debate to continue over the availability  method of delivery  and payment for health care products and services 
abbott believes that if legislation is enacted  it could have the effect of reducing access to health care products and services  or reducing prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services 
it is not possible to predict the extent to which abbott or the health care industry in general might be adversely affected by these factors in the future

in addition  certain abbott foreign subsidiaries enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage exposures to changes in foreign exchange rates for anticipated intercompany purchases by those subsidiaries whose functional currencies are not the us dollar 
these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are marked to market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
gains or losses will be included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold  generally within the next twelve months
