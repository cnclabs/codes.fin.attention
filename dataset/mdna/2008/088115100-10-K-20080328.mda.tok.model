item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
critical accounting estimates in preparing the company s financial statements  management selects and applies numerous accounting policies 
in applying these policies  management must make estimates and assumptions 
the accounting policy that is most susceptible to critical estimates and assumptions is the allowance for loan losses 
the determination of an appropriate provision is based on a determination of the probable amount of credit losses in the loan portfolio 
many factors influence the amount of potential charge offs of loans deemed to be uncollectible 
these factors include the specific characteristics of the loan portfolio and general economic conditions nationally and locally 
while management carefully considers these factors in determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary due to changed conditions  which could have an adverse impact on reported earnings in the future 
see provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses 
general the company does not transact any material business other than through its wholly owned subsidiary  the bank 
the bank s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan and investment portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the bank s provision for loan losses  fee income from wealth management and trust services and fees generated from loan and deposit products and  when strategically appropriate  investment and loan sale activities 
the bank s non interest expense principally consists of compensation and employee benefits  office occupancy and equipment expense  data processing  advertising and business promotion  professional fees and other expenses 
results of operations are also significantly affected by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may also materially impact the bank 
the economy of the company s market area is considered stable 
however  economic uncertainty continues to be a factor in the financial decision making process for both commercial and consumer banking customers 
operating strategy management s primary goal has been to maintain the bank s profitability  asset quality and its capital position by i investing in one to four family loans secured by properties located in its primary market area  ii investing in multi family  commercial real estate and construction and development loans secured by properties located in the bank s primary market area  to the extent that such loans meet the bank s general underwriting criteria  iii commercial and small business lending to businesses in the bank s primary market area  iv offering wealth management and trust services to customers in the bank s primary market area  v investing funds not utilized for loan investments in various equity and corporate debt investments and mortgage backed and mortgage related securities  and vi managing interest rate risk by emphasizing the origination of prime based and adjustable rate loans and short term fixed rate loans and investing in short term securities and generally selling longer term fixed rate loans that the bank originates 
the bank intends to continue this operating strategy in an effort to enhance its long term profitability while maintaining a reasonable level of interest rate risk and enhance such strategy by expanding the products and services it offers  as necessary  in order to improve its market share in its primary market area 
in this regard  the bank offers hour banking by telephone  debit card services and internet banking

liquidity liquidity is measured by the bank s ability to raise funds instantaneously by converting assets or liabilities to cash at either minimum or no loss to the bank 
as a matter of policy  liquidity is managed so that general operations can be funded and any extraordinary needs can be met 
the goal of the bank s liquidity management effort is to deploy excess funds so that profits can be maximized while the continuity of operations is maintained 
the factors that have most influenced the bank s liquidity policy are as follows reliability and stability of the bank s deposit base quality of the asset portfolio maturity structure and pledging status of the bank s investment portfolio potential for loan demand possibility of extraordinary liquidity demands 
table of contents anticipated changes in loan repayments level of the bank s non performing and non earning assets 
in addition  it is recognized that liquidity and asset liability management are two closely related components of the bank s overall financial management 
if asset liability gaps are matched  assets and liabilities will be maturing and or re pricing at about the same time 
this will keep the bank from becoming illiquid or vulnerable to changes in interest rates 
the bank measures its liquidity on three distinct levels 
primary liquidity serves as a source of funds to meet the immediate cash needs of the bank 
primary liquidity includes cash on hand and due from banks  un pledged securities that mature in days or less  federal funds sold and the current un advanced portion of available lines of credit fhlb and bank of america 
primary liquidity is calculated on at least a monthly basis and reported as part of the management alco reports 
the current internal guideline for primary liquidity is to of total assets 
secondary liquidity is intended as an additional source of funds for the bank to meet intermediate and long term cash needs to fund growth expectations and any unexpected funding demands on the bank 
secondary liquidity consists of un pledged investment securities available for sale  at current market value  and the un advanced portion of available borrowing capacity at the fhlb 
the current internal guideline for secondary liquidity is to of total assets 
as of december   the bank had total approved borrowing capacity with the federal home loan bank of boston of million 
total advances outstanding as of december  were million  leaving available borrowing capacity of approximately million 
total liquidity is the combination of the primary and secondary liquidity and is the total measure of the bank s growth capacity before the generation of additional deposits 
it is the intention of the bank to cover all foreseeable demands for cash and still maintain a total liquidity ratio of to of total assets 
as of december  the bank is in compliance with the established internal guidelines  with primary liquidity  secondary liquidity and total liquidity of  and of total assets  respectively 
as an additional source of liquidity  the bank has the ability to use brokered deposits as a source of funds 
the bank monitors the market for these products and if rates warrant they will be considered as an additional source of liquidity 
the bank has established a limit of of deposits as a maximum level of such deposits 
as of december  the bank had no brokered certificates of deposit 
the primary function of liquidity management is to assure adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
liquidity management involves the ability to meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs 
interest rate sensitivity management seeks to avoid fluctuating net interest margins and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
certain marketable investment securities  particularly those of shorter maturities  are the principal source of asset liquidity 
the company maintains such securities in an available for sale account as a liquidity resource 
securities maturing in one year or less amounted to million at december   additionally  a minimum amount of contractual payments in the amount of million for the mortgage backed securities portfolio is due within one year at december  at december   million of the bank s certificates of deposit and million in borrowings are expected to mature in one year or less 
assets such as federal funds sold  mortgages held for sale  pre payments and payoffs on mortgage backed securities  as well as maturing loans  are also sources of liquidity 

table of contents gap analysis the company s objectives are to be substantially neutral with respect to interest rate sensitivity and maintain a net cumulative gap at one year of less than of total assets 
the company s current practices are consistent with these objectives 
the company believes that it is successfully managing its interest rate risk consistent with these goals 
listed below is a gap analysis as of december  by re pricing date or maturity

off balance sheet arrangements the company is party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financial needs of its customers 
in the opinion of management  these off balance sheet arrangements are not likely to have a material effect on the company s financial conditions  results of operations  or liquidity

item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices 
in particular  the market price of interest earning assets and liabilities may be affected by changes in interest rates 
since net interest income the difference or spread between the interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings is the company s primary source of revenue  interest rate risk is the most significant non credit related market risk to which the company is exposed 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates as well as fluctuations in the level and duration of the company s assets and liabilities 
the company s average net interest margin for the year ended december  amounted to  in comparison to the for the year ended december  interest rate risk is the exposure of net interest income to movements in interest rates 
in addition to directly impacting net interest income  changes in interest rates can also affect the amount of new loan originations  the ability of borrowers to repay variable rate loans  the volume of loan prepayments and re financings  the carrying value of investment securities classified as available for sale and the flow and mix of deposits 
asset liability management the company s asset liability management committee the alco committee is comprised of the president and chief executive officer of the company  the senior executive vice president  chief operating officer and chief financial officer  the executive vice president and senior loan officer  the executive vice president of retail banking  the senior vice president of operations  the senior vice president and chief risk officer  and various lending and finance officers 
this committee is responsible for managing interest rate risk in accordance with policies approved by the board of directors regarding acceptable levels of interest rate risk  liquidity and capital 
this committee meets regularly and sets the rates on deposits and loan products  approves 
table of contents loan pricing strategies  reviews investment transactions and sets other strategic initiatives that relate to balance sheet management and structure as considered necessary 
this asset liability management committee reports to the board of director alco committee  which is comprised of several independent directors and the president and chief executive officer 
the company is subject to interest rate risk in the event that interest rates increase or decrease 
the two primary measurements of exposure to changes in interest rates  which the bank manages and monitors closely  are net interest income simulation  using various interest rate scenarios  and rate shocks  and their impact on the economic value of equity  given specific interest rate scenarios 
the bank works with an independent third party consultant to calculate and review these various measurements 
the board and management alco committees meet with the third party consultant on a quarterly basis to review the results of the current period as measured against established guidelines  trends from previous analyses and the impact of the strategies put in place on actual period over period results and to formulate strategies and direction to comply with established guidelines and to adjust to current economic conditions and direction 
net interest income simulation as part of its risk management practices  the company runs net interest income simulations to determine the impact on net interest income given an increase or decrease in interest rates  as these changes would have an impact on future levels of net interest income 
these simulations require that estimates and assumptions be made with respect to deposit pricing  including potential changes in non maturity core deposits  and reinvestment of cash flows from the loan and investment portfolios given changes in rates both up and down 
the results of the most recent simulation are as follows december  december  projected net interest income change from year base case projected net interest income change from year base case dollars in thousands year projections down basis points base up basis points year projections down basis points base up basis points the above changes in net interest income are within the risk tolerance levels established by the company policies 
economic value of equity in the event that interest rates increase or decrease  the economic value of equity eve changes due to its inherent correlation to changes in the market value of the company s assets and liabilities 
the company is considered liability sensitive if changes in the interest rate would cause the assets of the company to extend out  and as a result  liabilities would re price faster than assets 
conversely  the company is considered asset sensitive if interest rate changes cause liabilities to extend out  thus making assets re price faster than liabilities 
as of december   the capital ratio of the company on an eve basis  at current rate levels  is 
based on the most recent analysis it is estimated that an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points for example  an increase in the prime rate from to would result in an eve capital ratio of 
alternatively  if interest rates were to decrease by basis points  the eve capital ratio is estimated to be 
these changes are within the risk tolerance levels established by the company policies
