item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview alexander s  inc is a real estate investment trust reit engaged in leasing  managing  developing and redeveloping properties 
all references to we  us  our  company  and alexander s  refer to alexander s  inc we are managed by  and our properties are leased and developed by  vornado realty trust vornado 
we have seven properties in the greater new york city metropolitan area including the lexington avenue property  a  square foot multi use building in manhattan  and the kings plaza regional shopping center located in brooklyn 
we compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers 
our success depends upon  among other factors  trends of national and local economies  the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants  the availability and cost of capital  interest rates  construction and renovation costs  taxes  governmental regulations and legislation  population trends  zoning laws  and our ability to lease  sublease or sell our properties  at profitable levels 
our success is also subject to our ability to refinance existing debt as it comes due and on acceptable terms 
beginning in the second half of  the residential mortgage and capital markets began showing signs of stress  primarily in the form of escalating default rates on subprime mortgages and declining residential housing prices nationwide 
this credit crisis spread to the broader commercial credit markets and has generally reduced the availability of financing and widened spreads 
these factors  coupled with a slowing economy  may negatively impact the volume of real estate transactions and cap rates  which would negatively impact stock price performance of public real estate companies  including ours 
although our operating results were not negatively impacted by these conditions in  if these conditions persist in and beyond  our real estate portfolio may experience lower occupancy and lower effective rents  which would result in a corresponding decrease in net income and funds from operations

critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of our accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
this summary should be read in conjunction with a more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
real estate real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
as of december  and  the carrying amount of our real estate  net of accumulated depreciation  was  and  respectively 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the assets estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
betterments  significant renewals and certain costs directly related to the acquisition  improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
as real estate is undergoing development activities  all property operating expenses  including interest expense  are capitalized to the cost of the real property to the extent that we believe such costs are recoverable through the value of the property 
the recognition of depreciation expense requires estimates by us of the useful life of each property and improvement  as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
if we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate  depreciation expense could be misstated 
our properties are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change  indicating that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable 
in such an event  a comparison is made of the current and projected operating cash flows of each such property into the foreseeable future on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of the property 
if we incorrectly estimate undiscounted cash flows  impairment charges may be different 
the impact of such estimates in connection with future impairment analyses could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
we had no impairment charges each of the three years ended december  allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  and  as of december  and  respectively for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements 
we also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents  if necessary 
this receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements 
as of december  and  we had no allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents 
we exercise judgment in establishing these allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
these estimates may differ from actual results  which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates continued revenue recognition we have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rent revenue arising from tenant leases these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis  which includes the effects of rent steps and free rent abatements under the leases 
we commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use 
in addition  in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant  we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
percentage rent revenue arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon the sales of tenants exceeding defined thresholds these rents are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which states that this contingent revenue is only to be recognized after the contingency has been removed ie  the sales threshold has been achieved 
expense reimbursement revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective properties this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
condominium sales income arising from the sales of condominium units at the lexington avenue property income on deposits received for sales of condominium units has been deferred in accordance with the deposit method of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
gains on sales of condominium units are recognized under the percentage of completion method 
we assess  among other things  the collectibility of revenue before recognition 
if we incorrectly assess collectibility of revenue  net earnings and assets could be misstated 
stock appreciation rights stock appreciation rights sars are granted at of the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation expense for each sar is measured by the excess of the stock price at the current balance sheet date over the stock price at the previous balance sheet date 
if the stock price is lower at the current balance sheet date  previously recognized expense is reversed  but not below zero 
income taxes we operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  we are required  among other conditions  to distribute as dividends to our stockholders at least of annual reit taxable income 
as of december  and  we had net operating loss carryovers nols of approximately  and  respectively 
pursuant to the code  our nols generally would be available to offset the amount of our reit taxable income that would otherwise be required to be distributed as dividends to our stockholders 
accordingly  no dividends were paid in and we have elected to treat our wholly owned subsidiary  residential llc  as a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
the trs is subject to income tax at regular corporate tax rates 
our nols will not be available to offset taxable income of trs 
in the years ended december  and  we paid  and  respectively  for income taxes relating to the trs 
trs deferred income taxes  where applicable  are accounted for in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
however  deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence  including tax planning strategies and other factors 
as of december  and  we had no deferred tax assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets

those changes will be reported in comprehensive income 
the adoption of the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements as of december   did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations to determine the funded status as of the end of the fiscal year and to recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of the measurement date provisions of this standard is not expected to have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for us on january  we have not elected the fair value option for any of our existing financial instruments on the effective date and have not determined whether or not we will elect this option for any eligible financial instruments we acquire in the future

nareit defines ffo as net income or loss determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus specified non cash items  such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo and ffo per diluted share are used by management  investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity reits 
ffo and ffo per diluted share should be evaluated along with gaap net income and income per diluted share the most directly comparable gaap measures  as well as cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  in evaluating the operating performance of equity reits 
management believes that ffo and ffo per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  these non gaap measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in the company s statements of cash flows 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity
