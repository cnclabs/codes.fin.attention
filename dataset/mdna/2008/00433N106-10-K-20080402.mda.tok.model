over utilization  increasing regulation and legislation 
over utilization of the healthcare system is one of the factors behind increasing cost trends 
american citizens are utilizing healthcare services at an ever increasing rate 
behind this phenomenon is the fact that insurance plans and healthcare management organizations are structured to encourage usage 
small co payments  generally from or per office visit  encourage insured consumers to use the healthcare system more frequently because they do not perceive themselves ultimately as having to pay the full costs of the medical services received 
a number of insurers have pulled out of certain states  due to state regulations that no longer provide for a viable operating environment for many insurance companies 
as a result of these health coverage cancellations  those formerly insured individuals and families are required to pay more for their insurance coverage  cannot obtain any coverage because of pre existing conditions or simply remain uninsured for healthcare 
in addition  recently enacted federal legislation provides for tax favorable health savings accounts hsas 
individuals with high deductible health insurance coverage can deduct contributions to their hsa from their reported income for tax purposes 
in  the qualifying health insurance must have a deductible of at least  for individuals and  for families and the maximum amount that can be contributed is  for individuals and  for families 
amounts contributed to the hsas can be used for certain uninsured medical expenses  but generally cannot be used to pay for the health insurance premium 
individuals

while the federal medicare program covers a portion of healthcare expenses for senior americans  the gaps in coverage provide a significant market for supplemental plans 
our solutions the current state of our nation s healthcare industry provides significant market opportunities for our company 
we have implemented a number of solutions to assist consumers in saving money and navigating the healthcare system 
access plans is focused on developing and distributing products and services that meet the full range of healthcare product needs of consumers  including individuals  families  small businesses  and  in some locations  larger public and private employers 
these products range from prescription discount cards and medical discount programs  through defined benefit plans  major medical insurance and high deductible major medical insurance plans 
as the healthcare system and consumer needs change  we adjust our products and services 
we distribute these products through a number of channels  including licensed insurance agents for insured products  telephonic marketing  internet marketing and network marketing by face to face representatives for discount medical programs 
through our consumer plan division and our insurance marketing division  we provide programs that range from traditional discount medical programs that provide access to networks of providers that have agreed to provide our members with a reduced rate for services  to mini med programs that include some amount of defined benefit insurance  to major medical insurance with a variety of deductibles 
for certain products  our consumer plan division also provides patient advocacy services 
our regional healthcare division provides cost effective plan designs  claims management  cost containment  predictive modeling  wellness programs  and administrative and managed care services for organizations with self funded or partially self funded healthcare plans  including large public and private employers 
our benefit program management services successfully reduce costs and provide access to affordable healthcare by directing our clients to ppo providers and our own case management services 
together  these services allow employers and groups to provide substantive healthcare benefits at a fraction of the cost of traditional health insurance 
none of our products or services is materially affected by seasonal changes to our markets 
our consumer plan division our consumer plan division membership programs are offered through our own commissioned sales force see network marketing below under the trade names of usa healthcare savings and care entr e tm 

table of contents these programs are also offered through other distribution channels under the trade name healthcard now and through the trade names of our private label resellers 
our healthcare savings programs are not managed care 
for years  insurance companies have been successful by obtaining healthcare for their insureds at much lower prices than that obtainable by the self insured or uninsured person 
these benefits were provided through the use of preferred provider organizations ppos  where doctors  hospitals and other providers agreed to provide services to participants in the ppo at rates lower than those offered to the general public 
in our consumer plan division programs  we have contracted with some of these same ppos to provide the same negotiated rates to our program members and thereby allow our members to receive services at a discount compared to what members of the general public not participating in a ppo would pay 
in addition  through our acquisition of pme  we now own and manage our own networks of dental and vision providers that contract directly with us  agreeing to offer discounted rates to our members 
we allow the patient and the healthcare provider to decide treatment protocols with no interference from any third party 
we simply provide our members with access to healthcare providers in their geographical area that have agreed to provide their services for a discounted rate 
in most cases  the consumer pays  or makes arrangements to pay  the discounted rate directly to the provider at the point of service 
some medical providers choose to send the original full priced bill to us for repricing 
we reprice the bill to the discounted amount and then notify the provider and the member of the amount that should be paid 
the member then pays the repriced amount directly to the provider 
we are not involved in the making of payments to providers 
our programs routinely assist our members in saving an average of over  and often up to  on their medical costs 
for instance  in reviewing nearly  medical bills that were actually sent to us for repricing between september and december  we identified the ten most commonly reported procedures 
in analyzing the average full billed price for each such procedure and comparing it to the repriced amount  we were able to determine the average savings for our members for those most common procedures as follows avg

repriced amount reflects our consumer plan discount rate  and avg

current procedural terminology cpt is a registered trademark of the american medical association 
savings from dentists  vision providers  chiropractors and other services that do not require the use of a medical ppo are more difficult to track because our members pay a discounted rate at the point of service that is usually determined by a fee schedule and does not require our participation to find the discounted amount 
on average  we believe that our members save to on services from these other providers 
through our proprietary access dental network  our members receive average savings of on routine and most major dental care  and through our proprietary access vision network  members receive discounts of to on exams  prescription eyeglasses  and other purchases and services 

table of contents our membership programs encompass all aspects of healthcare  including physicians  hospitals  ancillary services  dentists  prescription drugs  vision care  hearing aids  chiropractic and alternative care  air ambulance  hour nurse hotline assistance

technology and member services we have made substantial investments in our proprietary technology and management information systems 
we currently operate on two proprietary platforms 
the first  the provident system  is a proprietary platform that we developed for capella 
the second  the affinity system is operated under a license that we acquired with our acquisition of pme 
employees of pme that we hired after our acquisition were responsible for the design and implementation of the affinity system 
these systems are used in most aspects of our consumer plan business  including maintaining member eligibility and demographic information  maintaining representative information including network reporting  paying commissions  maintaining a database of all providers and providing provider locator services  re pricing and payment of medical bills  drafting member accounts on a monthly basis  and tracking cash receipts and revenues 
we have also established websites for our programs that provide information about the program  allow for provider searches and allow new members and representatives to enroll on line 
the websites also allow representatives  through a password protected area to access support and training files and to view their network and commission information 
the websites are set up as self replicating websites to allow representatives a copy of the websites under a unique web address 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a one year agreement with lifeguard emergency travel  inc lifeguard 
under this agreement  lifeguard provided certain member support services  claims administration  and fulfillment services for our members in our consumer plan division 
on october   we acquired pme 
headquartered in the dallas area  pme offers  as a wholesaler  discount medical service products  provides back office support through its use of various operating systems  maintains a customer service facility  and develops products from both its proprietary and third party provider networks

our usa healthcare savings and care entr e tm programs are distributed by independent commission based contractors referred to as independent marketing representatives imrs 
our independent representatives become marketing representatives by paying an enrollment fee currently and an annual renewal fee currently and signing a standard representative agreement 
these imrs are not required to be licensed insurance agents 
imrs are generally paid a commission on the membership fees of each member they enroll for the life of that member s enrollment subject to the representative continuing to meet certain commission qualifications 
imrs may also recruit other representatives and earn override commissions on sales made by those representatives 
we pay up to in override commissions through seven upper levels or upline of the marketing representatives

the total regular or ongoing commission payout  including overrides based on monthly membership sales after the enrollment month and the amount contributed by us to the bonus pools  can be as high as of qualified membership sales

the insurance marketing division markets high deductible insurance plans that qualify for the hsa benefits 
short term medical plans 
insurance marketing can provide individuals who are between jobs or who are recent graduates with low cost  limited health insurance coverage for a limited period of time  typically six months or one year 
specialty medical and benefit plans 
these products offer healthcare plans for affinity groups  associations  employer groups and other groups 
mini medical plans 
these plans are sometimes referred to as scheduled benefit  limited benefit or defined benefit policies 
these policies are less expensive than traditional comprehensive healthcare insurance and usually require the member to undergo little or no medical underwriting  
table of contents available to all or most individuals  regardless of their health conditions  operate on an indemnity basis in most cases  reimbursing the member for certain incurred healthcare costs  and in some instances allowing the benefit to be assigned directly to the healthcare provider  eliminating the need for the member to pay the provider directly and then seek reimbursement 
these policies pay a certain amount for designated healthcare services 
for instance  a member could choose a program entitling him or her to  or  per day of hospitalization  with additional scheduled benefits for intensive care stays and surgery  for up to days in a calendar year 
senior health insurance  managed care  life insurance and annuity

medicare advantage plans 
our medicare advantage plans include medicare health maintenance organization hmos preferred provider organizations ppo private fee for service plans consumers who join a medicare advantage plan generally receive extra benefits and lower co payments than in the original medicare plan 
however  they may have to utilize doctors that belong to the plan or go to certain hospitals to get services

they have to pay their monthly medicare part b premium to medicare 
in addition  they may have to pay a monthly premium to the medicare advantage plan for the extra benefits that they receive 
part d prescription plans 
people who have medicare part a or medicare part b can purchase insurance to pay for part of their prescription drugs 
these plans are provided through private insurance companies and are available to eligible seniors who enroll within certain enrollment and eligibility periods 
final expense insurance plans 
relatively small face amount life insurance plans designed for senior americans to help pay for funeral costs  medical bills and other final expenses 
developments in the medicare supplemental insurance or medigap markets have led to declining revenues and earnings in that part of our business 
there are standardized medicare supplemental insurance plans a through l also called medigap plans 
each plan has different benefits  but within each standardized medicare supplemental insurance plan  benefits are identical from one carrier to the next 
therefore  competition in this market has centered on premium cost to the insured  resulting in thinner margins and lower compensation to selling agents and intermediaries 
while we still have nearly  such policies in force  issuance of new policies has rapidly declined during accordingly  we have decided to not emphasize this part of our business  while continuing to service in force policies

in the first quarter of  foresight successfully completed an sas type i examination by independent registered public accountants 
we believe that certain former employees and business practices of foresight are currently under investigation by the us department of justice the doj 
in  there was considerable adverse publicity in the el paso community about the investigation 
for more information about this investigation  see item legal proceedings  below 
we believe that this investigation and the resulting publicity contributed to the loss of two key clients of foresight in that had a material adverse effect on the business and operations of foresight 
reliance on key customers

additionally  a material portion of regional healthcare s revenues have historically been derived from foresight s contractual relationships with a few key governmental entities 
competition consumer plan division 
competition for program members within the healthcare savings industry has become more intense 
we offer membership programs that provide products and services similar to or directly in competition with products and services offered by our network marketing competitors as well as the providers of the products and services through other channels of distribution 
competition for new representatives is intense  as these individuals have a variety of products that they can choose to market  whether competing with us in the healthcare market or not 
our principal competitors are ameriplan  the amacore group  inc  new benefits  inc  careington international  coverdell  international association of businesses  and family care 
we also compete with all types of network marketing companies throughout the us for new representatives 
our other competitors 
table of contents include large retailers  financial institutions  insurance companies  preferred provider organization networks  and other organizations that offer benefit programs to their customers 
many of our competitors have substantially larger customer bases and greater financial and other resources 
insurance marketing division 
we compete in the highly competitive individual health insurance industry 
the major medical products and services of the insurance companies that we offer compete with large national  regional and specialty health insurers  including assurant  and various blue cross blue shield companies 
furthermore  senior managed care  medicare products and medicare advantage medical savings accounts offered by our acp division compete with other national  regional and specialty insurers  including universal american financial corp  banker s life and casualty  united teachers associates insurance company  torchmark  pacificare  united healthcare  mutual of omaha  conseco  inc  blue cross organizations  us health  and medicare hmos 
in addition  we compete for insurance agencies and their agents to offer  sell and provide the insurance products and financial services that we offer 
many of our competitors in the insurance marketing industry have substantially greater financial resources  broader product lines  or greater experience than we do 
we compete on the basis of price  reputation  diversity of product offerings and flexibility of coverage  ability to attract and retain agents  and the quality and level of services provided to the independent insurance agencies and their agents 
we face additional competition due to a trend among healthcare providers and insurance companies to combine and form networks in order to contract directly with small businesses and other prospective customers to provide healthcare services 
in addition  because the products and services that we offer are marketed through independent agents  most of which represent and offer insurance products of multiple insurance companies  we compete for the marketing focus of each independent agent 
regional healthcare division 
foresight operates in the el paso metropolitan market and competes against regional and national health benefit plans such as blue cross blue shield  united healthcare  cigna and aetna 
principal competitive factors 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our industries  some of which are not within our control  include the ability to maintain contracts with reputable preferred provider organization ppo networks that offer substantial healthcare savings  the ability to maintain contracts with reputable insurance companies and insurance agents and agencies  the ability to attract and retain independent marketing representatives for our consumer plan division  the ability to identify  develop and offer unique membership healthcare programs  the quality and breadth of the healthcare membership programs offered  the quality and extent of customer service  the ability to offer substantial savings on major medical costs such as hospital and surgical costs  the ability to combine the programs with affordable insurance plans that have high deductibles or set payment for hospitalization  prices of products and service offered  marketing expertise  the ability to effectively market the product on the internet  compensation plans for representatives  the ability to hire and retain employees  the development by others of member programs that are competitive with our programs  
table of contents responsiveness to customer needs  the ability to satisfy investigations on the part of state attorneys general  insurance commissioners and other regulatory bodies  and the ability to finance promotions and commission advance programs for the recruiting of members and representatives 
competitive risk 
while we believe that we are a leader in the industry  there is no assurance that competitors will not develop their own software that re prices medical bills or a full service customer service function similar to ours  our competitors will not increase their emphasis on programs similar to our programs to more effectively compete with us  our competitors will not recruit our independent marketing representatives and insurance agents by offering more attractive sales commissions  our competitors will not provide programs comparable or superior to our programs at lower membership fees or lower insurance premiums  our competitors will not adapt more quickly to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements  new competitors will not enter the market  other businesses such as insurance companies or preferred provider organization networks will not themselves introduce competing programs  and our competitors will not develop more effective marketing campaigns that more effectively utilize direct mail and television advertising 
this increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
business objectives and plans our objective is to sustain and expand our leadership position as a provider of unique healthcare membership service programs and consumer driven healthcare solutions and as a distributor of health insurance plans 
key elements of our business plan are as follows continue to develop a broad spectrum of unique healthcare service programs for multiple markets 
our focus is on the continued development and introduction of unique programs that address the health and consumer needs of targeted consumer groups 
by varying the features  including discounts medical  consumer and business services  defined benefit insurance and fully insured health plans  we are able to meet the product and pricing needs of a broad market 
we anticipate that this will allow us to capture a larger share of the healthcare market through existing marketing channels and through establishment of new client relationships 
continue to develop a recurring revenue base

governmental regulation we are subject to federal  state and local laws  regulations  administrative determinations  court decisions and similar constraints hereinafter regulations 
possible insurance company regulation of our consumer plan division 
our discount medical plans are not insurance and do not subject us to regulation as an insurance company or a seller of insurance 
however  regulations in certain states currently regulate or restrict the offering of these programs 
occasionally  we receive inquiries from insurance commissioners in various states that require us to supply information about our discount healthcare programs  representatives  etc 
to the insurance commissioner or other state regulatory agency 
to date  these agencies have concurred with our view that our discount healthcare programs are not a form of insurance 
there is no assurance that this situation will not change in the future  and an insurance commissioner will successfully challenge our ability to offer our programs without compliance with state insurance regulation 
state discount medical program regulation 
over the last few years  over states have enacted legislation or adopted regulations that specifically address the operation and marketing of discount medical programs like ours 
these laws vary in scope and operation 
some of these laws apply to discounts on all 
table of contents healthcare purchases  others regulate only prescription discounts  while others exclude prescription discounts but regulate other services 
furthermore  some of these laws contain only provisions that relate to the operation and marketing of discount medical plans and some require licensing and registration 
because this legislation or regulations are newly enacted or adopted  we do not know the scope and full effect on our operations 
there is a risk that compliance with the legislation and or regulations could have material adverse effects on our operations and financial condition 
there is also the risk that a state will adopt regulations or enact legislation restricting or prohibiting the sale of our medical discount programs in the state 
in addition  california views our discount medical plans as managed care and its department of managed healthcare has taken the position that we must seek and eventually obtain a license under the knox keene act 
compliance with these regulations on a state by state basis has been and will continue to be expensive and cumbersome 
compliance with federal and state regulations is generally our responsibility 
the medical discount plan industry is especially susceptible to charges by the media of regulatory noncompliance and unfair dealing 
as is often the case  the media may publicize perceived non compliance with consumer protection regulations and violations of notions of fair dealing with consumers 
our failure to comply with current  as well as newly enacted or adopted  federal and state legislation and regulations could have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations in addition to the following non compliance may cause us to become the subject of a variety of enforcement or private actions  compliance with changes in applicable regulations could materially increase the associated operating costs  non compliance with any rules and regulations enforced by a federal or state consumer protection authority may subject us or our management personnel to fines or various forms of civil or criminal prosecution  and non compliance or alleged non compliance may result in negative publicity potentially damaging our reputation  network relationships  client relationships and the relationship with program members  independent marketing representatives and consumers in general 
insurance regulations 
government regulation of health and life insurance  annuities and healthcare coverage and health plans is a changing area of law and varies from state to state 
although we are not an insurance company  the insurance companies from which we obtain our products and financial services are subject to various federal and state regulations applicable to their operations 
these insurance companies must comply with constantly evolving regulations and make changes occasionally to services  products  structure or operations in accordance with the requirements of those regulations 
similar to the insurance companies providing products and services offered by us  we are unable to accurately predict additional government regulations that may be enacted in the future affecting the insurance industry and the offered products and service or how existing or future regulations might be interpreted 
additional governmental regulation or future interpretation of existing regulations may increase the cost of compliance or materially affect the insurance products and services offered by us through independent insurance agencies and their agents and our operations  products or profitability 
we must rely on the insurance companies that provide the insurance products and financial services offered by insurance marketing to carefully monitor state and federal legislative and regulatory activity as it affects their insurance products and services 
we believe that the insurance products and financial services that we offer comply in all material respects with all applicable federal and state regulations 
we work closely with independent associations that provide discounts and other benefits to groups of consumers 
among the benefits afforded to the members of such associations are varying forms of insurance 
our ability to offer insurance products that we are authorized to distribute to these 
table of contents associations for inclusion in their benefit packages may be affected by governmental regulation or future interpretation of existing regulations that may increase the cost of regulatory compliance or affect the nature and scope of products that we may make available to such associations 
product claims and advertising 
the federal trade commission and certain states regulate advertising  product claims  and other consumer matters  including advertising of our products 
all advertising  promotional and solicitation materials used by marketing representatives require our approval prior to use 
the federal trade commission may institute enforcement actions against companies for false and misleading advertising of consumer products 
in addition  the federal trade commission has increased its scrutiny of the use of testimonials  including those used by us and our marketing representatives 
we have not been the target of federal trade commission enforcement action 
there is no assurance that the federal trade commission will not question our advertising or other operations in the future  a state will not interpret product claims presumptively valid under federal law as illegal under that state s regulations  or future federal trade commission regulations or decisions will not restrict the permissible scope of such claims 
we are also subject to the risk of claims by marketing representatives and their customers who may file actions on their own behalf  as a class or otherwise  and may file complaints with the federal trade commission or state or local consumer affairs offices 
these agencies may take action on their own initiatives against us for alleged advertising or product claim violations  or on a referral from independent marketing representatives  customers or others 
remedies sought in these actions may include consent decrees and the refund of amounts paid by the complaining independent marketing representatives or consumer  refunds to an entire class of independent marketing representatives or customers  client refunds  or other damages  as well as changes in our method of doing business 
a complaint based on the practice of one marketing representative  whether or not we authorized the practice  could result in an order affecting some or all of our marketing representatives in a particular state 
also  an order in one state could influence courts or government agencies in other states considering similar matters 
proceedings resulting from these complaints could result in significant defense costs  settlement payments or judgments and could have a material adverse effect on us 
network marketing organization 
our network marketing system is subject to a number of federal and state regulations administered by the federal trade commission and various state agencies 
these regulations are generally directed at ensuring that advancement  within a network marketing organization  is based on sales of the organization s products rather than investment in the organization or other non sales related criteria 
for instance  in certain markets there are limits on the extent that marketing representatives may earn royalties on sales generated by marketing representatives that were not directly sponsored by the marketing representative 
our network marketing organization and activities are subject to scrutiny by various state and federal governmental regulatory agencies to ensure compliance with various types of laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations include securities  franchise investment  business opportunity and criminal laws prohibiting the use of pyramid or endless chain types of selling organizations 
the compensation structure of these selling organizations is very complex  and compliance with all of the applicable laws is uncertain in light of evolving interpretation of existing laws and the enactment of new laws and regulations pertaining to this type of product distribution 
as of the date of this report  we are not aware of any legal actions pending or threatened by any governmental authority against us regarding the legality of our network marketing operations 
as of december   we had marketing representatives for our consumer plan division in states 
we review the requirements of various states  as well as seek legal advice  regarding the structure and operation of our network marketing to ensure that it complies with all of the applicable laws and regulations pertaining to network sales organizations 
based on these efforts and the experience of our management  we believe that we are in compliance with all applicable federal and state regulatory requirements 
we have not 
table of contents obtained no action letters or advance rulings from any federal or state security regulator or other governmental agency concerning the legality of our network operations  nor are we relying on a formal opinion of counsel to that effect 
we accordingly are subject to the risk that one or more of our network marketing organizations could be found to not comply with applicable laws and regulations 
our failure to comply with these regulations could have a material adverse effect on us in a particular market or in general 
we are subject to the risk of challenges to the legality of our network marketing organization  including claims by our marketing representatives  both individually and as a class 
most likely these claims would be based on the network marketing organization allegedly being operated as an illegal pyramid scheme in violation of federal securities laws  state unfair practice and fraud laws  and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
in the event of challenges to the legality of our network marketing organization by distributors  we would be required to demonstrate that our network marketing organization complies with applicable regulatory laws 
a final ruling against us could result in a material liability 
moreover  even if we were successful in defending against these challenges  the defense costs  both in dollars spent and in management time  could be material and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the negative publicity of these challenges could adversely affect our revenues and ability to attract and retain marketing representatives 
healthcare regulation and reform 
government regulation and reform of the healthcare industry may also affect the manner in which insurance marketing conducts its business in the future 
there continues to be diverse legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the federal and state levels to affect aspects of the nation s healthcare system 
the gramm leach bliley act mandated restrictions on the disclosure and safeguarding of our insureds financial information 
the usa patriot act placed new federal compliance requirements relating to anti money laundering  customer identification and information sharing 
in addition  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa requires certain guaranteed issuance and renewability of health insurance coverage for individuals and small employer groups and limits exclusions on pre existing conditions 
hipaa has also mandated the adoption of extensive standards for the use and disclosure of health information 
hipaa also mandated the adoption of standards for the exchange of electronic health information in an effort to encourage overall administrative simplification and enhance the effectiveness and the efficiency of the healthcare industry 
hipaa s security standards became effective april  and further mandated that specific requirements be met relating to maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of electronic health information and protecting it from anticipated hazards or uses and disclosures that are not permitted 
our own re pricing software systems are considered hipaa compliant and we believe that those used by our third party service providers are also compliant 
we previously engaged a consulting firm to assist us in our efforts to continuously comply with all other hipaa regulations 
we believe that we are in compliance with these regulations 
we plan to continually audit our compliance  and accordingly cannot give assurance that our costs of continuing to comply with hipaa will not be material to us 
sanctions for failing to comply with standards issued pursuant to hipaa include criminal penalties and civil sanctions 
in addition to federal regulation and reform  many states have enacted  or are considering  various healthcare reform statutes 
these reforms relate to  among other things  managed care practices  prompt pay payment practices  health insurer liability and mandated benefits 
most states have also enacted patient confidentiality laws that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information 
as with all areas of legislation  the federal regulations establish minimum standards and preempt conflicting state laws that are less restrictive but will allow state laws that are more restrictive 
we expect that this trend of increased legislation will continue 
we are unable to predict what state reforms will be enacted or how they would affect our business 
e commerce regulation 
we may be subject to additional federal and state statutes and regulations in connection with our product strategy  which includes internet services and products 
on an increasingly frequent basis  federal and state legislators are proposing laws and regulations that apply to internet based commerce and communications 
areas being affected by this regulation include user privacy  pricing  content  taxation  copyright protection  distribution and quality of products  and services 
to the extent that our 
table of contents products and services would be subject to these laws and regulations  the sale of our products and our business could be harmed 
legislative developments 
numerous proposals to reform the current healthcare system have been introduced in the us congress and in various state legislatures 
proposals have included  among other things  modifications to the existing employer based insurance system  a quasi regulated system of managed competition among health insurers  and a single payer  public program 
changes in healthcare policy could significantly affect our business 
legislation has been introduced from time to time in the us congress that could result in the federal government assuming a more direct role in regulating insurance companies 
we are unable to evaluate new legislation that may be proposed and when or whether any legislation will be enacted and implemented 
however  many of the proposals  if adopted  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  while others  if adopted  could potentially benefit the company s business 
employees as of december   we had full time employees in the following departments number of department employees customer services and claims administration sales and marketing executive and administration finance and accounting information services the total number of our employees after we completed the merger with icm in january and our acquisition of pme in october increased to our future performance depends in significant part upon the continued service of our key technical and management personnel  and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified and motivated personnel in all areas of our operations 
competition for qualified personnel is intense 
we provide no assurance that we can retain key managerial and technical employees  or that we can attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
our employees are not represented by a labor union 
we have not experienced any work stoppages  and consider our employee relations to be good 
item a 
risk factors our risk factors the matters discussed below and elsewhere in this report should be considered when evaluating our business operations and strategies 
additionally  there may be risks and uncertainties that we are not aware of or that we currently deem immaterial  which may become material factors affecting our operations and business success 
many of the factors are not within our control 
we provide no assurance that one or more of these factors will not adversely affect the market price of our common stock  adversely affect our future operations  adversely affect our business  adversely affect our financial condition  adversely affect our results of operations  require significant reduction or discontinuance of our operations  require us to seek a merger partner  or require us to sell additional stock on terms that are highly dilutive to our shareholders

as a result  the reader is cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
during the years of  and we incurred losses from operations and these losses may continue 
during the years ended december   and we incurred losses from continuing operations of   and  respectively and net losses of   and  respectively 
as part of those operating losses and net losses  we incurred goodwill impairment charges of   including tax considerations of  and  in  and  respectively 
in  we recorded goodwill impairment charges of  for foresight due to the loss of significant contracts   for capella due to the failure of certain new product and marketing initiatives to achieve expected results  and  for the insurance marketing division due to significant declines in sales of medicare supplemental policies 
in  we recorded goodwill impairment charges of  including tax considerations of  for foresight and  for capella 
in  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of  related to capella 
the operating losses before goodwill impairment charges in and were primarily attributable to the continuing costs associated with our medical savings program 
there is no assurance that losses from our medical savings program will not continue or that our other operations will become or continue to be profitable in or thereafter 
we may be unable to obtain additional capital on a timely basis or on acceptable terms to fund our working capital requirements 
as a result of our decline in revenues  our merger with icm  our acquisition of pme  and certain marketing and sales initiatives  we have used significant amounts of cash in our operations and in financing and investing activities 
as of december   we had a balance of million of unrestricted cash 
in  cash used in investing and financing activities was million and 
million  respectively  while our operating activities provided million in cash 
this resulted in a decrease of 
million in our cash and cash equivalents during we expect that we will need significant additional cash resources to operate and execute our business plan in the future  particularly with respect to our agent advance commission programs that are critical to the success of our insurance marketing division 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our ability to maintain our existing cost structure and return on sales  fund obligations for additional 
table of contents capital and execute our business and strategic plans as currently conceived 
if these resources are insufficient to satisfy our cash requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a credit facility 
the sale of additional equity securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
additional indebtedness could result in debt service obligations and lender imposed operating and financing covenants that restrict our operations 
in addition  financing might be unavailable in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our subsidiary  foresight  derives a large percentage of its income from a few key clients and the loss of any of those clients could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
foresight provides full service third party administration services to adjudicate and pay medical claims for employers who have self funded all or any portion of their healthcare costs 
foresight s primary market is governmental entities in the metropolitan area of el paso  texas  including cities and school districts 
there are a limited number of these types of entities within that metropolitan area 
during the second and third quarters of  we announced several adverse events related to the loss of two major customers and possible loss or non renewal of another major customer beyond contract expirations in as of june   we re evaluated the carrying value of goodwill related to foresight and determined that an impairment charge of  that reduced the carrying value of the goodwill to zero for the loss of these contracts was appropriate 
there is no assurance that foresight will obtain renewal or extension on its remaining contracts 
the loss of any of these remaining contractual relationships will adversely affect our operating results and the loss of more than one of these contractual relationships could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
we have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls  that could affect our ability to ensure timely and reliable financial reports 
our processing and recording of commission revenues earned and commission expenses payable to agents are key determinants of material revenues and expenses reported in our financial statements 
this processing and recording of commission revenue and expense  together with the accurate and timely disbursement of commission payments to certain agents  is dependent upon our timely receipt of complete and accurate information about such commissions from the insurance carriers whose policies we sell 
while we have established multiple compensating manual processes designed to partially mitigate these weaknesses  we nevertheless have insufficient control procedures in place to fully assure that commission information received from those insurance carriers is complete  accurate or received in a timely manner 
additionally  some information is processed for us by outside third party service bureaus or administrators 
some of those third party service bureaus or administrators have not had their controls evaluated by independent registered accountants and they have not received sas reports on their controls 
we have performed limited reviews of their controls and have preliminarily determined that they have insufficient information technology general controls 
additionally  we determined that we had numerous weaknesses in our own internal information technology controls in these areas 
our failure to receive and process such commission information in a timely  complete and accurate fashion or to process it accurately could adversely impact our ability to pay commissions to our agents in a timely and accurate manner or to state revenues or expenses in our financial statements in a materially correct manner 
we rely on our insurance carrier partners to accurately and regularly prepare commission reports  and if these reports are inaccurate or not sent to us in a timely manner  our results of operations could suffer 
our insurance marketing division generates revenues primarily from the receipt of commissions paid to us by insurance companies based upon the insurance policies sold to consumers through agents with which we have contracted 
these revenues are in the form of first year and renewal commissions that vary by company and product 
in calculating the amount of commission earned by us and in accounting for commission paid to us by insurance companies  we rely on data not under our control  including data provided to us by the 
table of contents insurance company and premium collection and payment service providers engaged by the insurance company to calculate and pay commissions 
the data that we receive may fluctuate as the insurance company or its collection and payment service providers make adjustments to their reports of policies sold 
we have implemented our own processes to evaluate the data that we receive to help confirm that it is consistent with the number and types of policies that we believe have been sold 
however  it is difficult for us to independently determine whether carriers are reporting all commissions due to us  primarily because the majority of our members terminate their policies by discontinuing their premium payments to the carrier instead of informing us of the cancellation 
because we cannot always rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the data that we receive from the insurance company or its payment service providers  our financial reports are subject to adjustment and we may not collect and recognize revenue that we are entitled  both of which would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
the same data from insurance carriers or their payment service providers is used to calculate the balances of advanced commissions owed by us to the insurance carrier or owed to us by agents 
because we cannot always rely on the accuracy or timeliness of the data that we receive from the insurance company or its payment service  our calculation of these balances may fluctuate and resulting adjustments may adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our processing and recording of commission revenues earned and commission expenses payable to agents are key determinants of material revenues and expenses reported in our financial statements 
this processing and recording of commission revenue and expense  together with the accurate and timely disbursement of commission payments to agents  is dependent upon our timely receipt of complete and accurate information about such commissions from the insurance carriers whose policies we sell 
our failure to receive such commission information in a timely  complete and accurate fashion could adversely impact our ability to pay commissions in a timely and accurate manner or to state revenues or expenses in our financial statements in a materially correct manner 
our revenues in the consumer plan division are largely dependent on the independent marketing representatives  whose reduced sales efforts or termination may result in significant loss of revenues 
our success and growth depend in large part upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate the network of independent marketing representatives who principally market our usa healthcare savings and care entr e tm medical savings programs 
our independent marketing representatives typically offer and sell theseprograms on a part time basis  and may engage in other business activities 
these marketing representatives may give higher priority to other products or services  reducing their efforts devoted to marketing our programs 
also  our ability to attract and retain marketing representatives could be negatively affected by adverse publicity relating to our programs and operations 
under our network marketing system  the marketing representatives downline organizations are headed by a relatively small number of key representatives who are responsible for a substantial percentage of our total revenues 
the loss of a significant number of marketing representatives  including any key representatives  for any reason  could adversely affect our revenues and operating results  and could impair our ability to attract new distributors 
a large part of our consumer plan division revenues are dependent on key relationships with a few private label resellers and we may become more dependent on sales by a few private label resellers 
our revenues from sales of our independent marketing representatives have declined and continue to decline 
as a result  we have become more dependent on sales made by private label resellers to whom we sell our discount medical programs 
if sales made by our independent marketing representatives continue to decline or if our efforts to increase sales through private label resellers succeed  we may become more dependent on sales made by our private label resellers 
because a large number of these sales may be made by 
table of contents a few resellers  our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected by the loss of our relationship with any of those private label resellers 
development and maintenance of relationships with preferred provider organizations are critical and the loss of such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business 
as part of our business operations  we must develop and maintain relationships with preferred provider organizations within each market area that our consumer plan division products are offered 
development and maintenance of these relationships with healthcare providers within a preferred provider organization is in part based on professional relationships and the reputation of our management and marketing personnel 
because many members that receive healthcare services are self insured and responsible for payment for healthcare services received  failure to pay or late payments by members may negatively affect our relationship with the preferred provider organizations 
consequently  preferred provider organization relationships may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  including departures of key personnel and alterations in professional relationships and members failures to pay for services received 
the loss of a preferred provider organization within a geographic market area may not be replaced on a timely basis  if at all  and may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we currently rely heavily on two key preferred provider organizations and the loss of or a change in our relationships with these providers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
private healthcare systems phcs  a division of multiplan  inc  is the preferred provider organization through which most of our members have obtained savings on medical services through our care entr e tm program 
pme has utilized the galaxy health network galaxy preferred provider organization 
the loss of phcs or galaxy as a preferred provider organization or a disruption of our members access to phcs or galaxy could affect our ability to retain our members and could  therefore  adversely affect our business 
while we currently enjoy a good relationship with galaxy  phcs and multiplan  there are no assurances that we will continue to have a good relationship with them in the future  or that multiplan  having recently acquired phcs  may choose to change its business strategy in a way that adversely affects us by either limiting or terminating our members access to the phcs network or by entering into agreements with our competitors to provide their members access to phcs 
we face competition for marketing representatives as well as competitive offerings of healthcare products and services 
within the healthcare savings membership industry  competition for members is becoming more intense 
we offer membership programs that provide products and services similar to or directly in competition with products and services offered by our network marketing competitors as well as the providers of such products and services through other channels of distribution 
some of our private label resellers have chosen to sell a product that is competitive to ours in order to maintain multiple sources for their products 
others may also choose to sell competing products 
furthermore  marketing representatives have a variety of products that they can choose to market  whether competing with us in the healthcare market or not 
our business operations compete in two channels of competition 
first  we compete based upon the healthcare products and services offered 
these competitors include companies that offer healthcare products and services through membership programs much like our programs  as well as insurance companies  preferred provider organization networks and other organizations that offer benefit programs to their customers 
second  we compete with all types of network marketing companies throughout the us for new marketing representatives 
many of our competitors have substantially larger customer bases and greater financial and other resources 
we provide no assurance that our competitors will not provide healthcare benefit programs comparable or superior to our programs at lower membership prices or adapt more quickly to evolving healthcare industry 
table of contents trends or changing industry requirements 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  and loss of market share  any of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there is no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with current and future competitors 
government regulation and related private party litigation may adversely affect our financial position and limit our operations 
in recent years  several states have enacted laws and regulations that govern discount medical program organizations dmpos 
the laws vary in scope  ranging from registration to a comprehensive licensing process with oversight over all aspects of the program  including the manner by which discount medical programs are sold  the price at which they are sold  the relationship of the dmpo licenses or registrations for both subsidiaries in our consumer plan division 
we hold these licenses in every jurisdiction where such a license or registration is required to be held and where the respective subsidiary conducts business 
because these laws and regulations are relatively new  we do not know the full extent of how they will affect our business or whether or not we will be able to maintain all necessary licenses 
our need to comply with these regulations may adversely affect or limit our future operations 
the cost of complying with these laws and regulations has and will likely continue to have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
government regulation of health and life insurance  annuities and healthcare coverage and health plans is a changing area of law and varies from state to state 
although we are not an insurance company  the insurance companies from which we obtain our products and financial services are subject to various federal and state regulations applicable to their operations 
these insurance companies must comply with constantly evolving regulations and make changes occasionally to services  products  structure or operations in accordance with the requirements of those regulations 
we may also be limited in how we market and distribute our products and financial services as a result of these laws and regulations 
we market memberships in associations that have been formed to provide various consumer benefits to their members 
these associations may include in their benefit packages insurance products that are issued under group or blanket policies covering the association s members 
most states allow these memberships to be sold under certain circumstances without a licensed insurance agent making each sale 
if a state were to determine that our sales of these memberships do not comply with their regulations  our ability to continue selling such memberships would be affected and we might be subject to fines and penalties and may have to issue refunds or provide restitution to the associations and their members 
the business practices and compensation arrangements of the insurance intermediary industry  including our practices and arrangements  are subject to uncertainty due to investigations by various government authorities and related private litigation 
the legislatures of various states may adopt new laws addressing contingent commission arrangements  including laws prohibiting such arrangements  and addressing disclosures of these arrangements to insureds 
various state departments of insurance may also adopt new regulations addressing these matters 
while it is not possible to predict the outcome of the government inquiries and investigations into the insurance industry s commission payment practices or the response by the market and government regulators  any material decrease in our profit sharing contingent commissions is likely to have an adverse effect on our results from operations 
our failure to protect our members and customers data could adversly affect our financial position and operations by damaging our reputation  harming our business and causing us to expend capital and other resources to protect against future security breaches 
certain of our services are based upon the collection  distribution  and protection of sensitive private data 
unauthorized users might access that data  and human error or technological failures might cause the wrongful dissemination of that data 
if we experience a security breach  the integrity of certain of our services may be affected and such a breach could violate certain of our marketing partner agreements  which could give our marketing partners the right to terminate such agreements with us 
we have incurred  and may incur in the 
table of contents future  significant costs to protect against the threat of a security breach 
we may also incur significant costs to solve problems that may be caused by future breaches or to prevent such breaches 
any breach or perceived breach could subject us to legal claims from our marketing partners or customers and or regulatory or law enforcement entities under laws that govern the protection of non public personal information 
moreover  any public perception that we have engaged in the unauthorized release of  or have failed to adequately protect  private information could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain members and customers 
in addition  unauthorized third parties might alter information in our databases that could adversely affect both our ability to market our services and the credibility of our information 
the failure of our network marketing organization to comply with federal and state regulation could result in enforcement action and imposition of penalties  modification of our network marketing system  and negative publicity 
our network marketing organization is subject to federal and state laws and regulations administered by the federal trade commission and various state agencies 
these laws and regulations include securities  franchise investment  business opportunity and criminal laws prohibiting the use of pyramid or endless chain types of selling organizations 
these regulations are generally directed at ensuring that product and service sales are ultimately made to consumers as opposed to other marketing representatives and that advancement within the network marketing organization is based on sales of products and services  rather than on investment in the company or other non retail sales related criteria 
the compensation structure of a network marketing organization is very complex 
compliance with all of the applicable regulations and laws is uncertain because of the evolving interpretations of existing laws and regulations  and the enactment of new laws and regulations pertaining in general to network marketing organizations and product and service distribution 
accordingly  there is the risk that our network marketing system could be found to not comply with applicable laws and regulations that could result in enforcement action and imposition of penalty  require modification of the marketing representative network system  result in negative publicity  or have a negative effect on distributor morale and loyalty 
any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations as well as our financial condition 
the legality of our network marketing organization is subject to challenge by our marketing representatives  which could result in significant defense costs  settlement payments or judgments  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our network marketing organization is subject to legality challenge by our marketing representatives  both individually and as a class 
generally  these challenges would be based on claims that our marketing network program was operated as an illegal pyramid scheme in violation of federal securities laws  state unfair practice and fraud laws and the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act 
proceedings resulting from these claims could result in significant defense costs  settlement payments  or judgments  and could have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents the advertising and promotional activities of our independent marketing representatives and private label customers are subject to and may violate federal and state regulation causing us to be subject to the imposition of civil penalties  fines  injunctions and loss of state licenses 
the federal trade commission ftc and most states regulate advertising  product claims  and other consumer matters  including advertising of our healthcare savings products 
all advertising  promotional and solicitation materials used by our independent marketing representatives and private label customers must be approved by us prior to use 
we are currently under investigation by the texas attorney general as a result of the activities of one of our private label customers  with whom we have terminated our relationship 
while we have not been the target of ftc enforcement action for the advertising of  or product claims related to  our healthcare savings products  there can be no assurance that the ftc will not question our advertising or other operations in the future 
in addition  there can be no assurance that a state  in addition to texas  will not interpret our product claims presumptively valid under federal law as illegal under that state s regulations  or that future ftc regulations or decisions will not restrict the permissible scope of the claimed savings 
we are subject to the risk of claims by our independent marketing representatives and private label customers and members of our care entree tm programs and those under private label arrangements may file actions on their own behalf  as a class or otherwise  and may file complaints with the ftc or state or local consumer affairs offices 
these agencies may take action on their own initiative against us for alleged advertising or product claim violations 
these actions may include consent decrees and the refund of amounts paid by the complaining members  refunds to an entire class of independent marketing representatives  private label customers or members  or other damages  as well as changes in our method of doing business 
a complaint because of a practice of one independent marketing representative or private label customer  whether or not that practice was authorized by us  could result in an order affecting some or all of our independent marketing representatives and private label customers in the particular state  and an order in one state could influence courts or government agencies in other states considering similar matters 
proceedings resulting from these complaints may result in significant defense costs  settlement payments or judgments and could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we may have exposure and liability relating to non compliance with the health insurance portability and accountability act of and the cost of compliance could be material 
in april privacy regulations were promulgated by the department of health and human services pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa 
hipaa imposes extensive restrictions on the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information by certain entities 
also as part of hipaa  the department of health and human services has issued final regulations standardizing electronic transactions between health plans  providers and clearinghouses 
healthcare plans  providers and claims administrators are required to conform their electronic and data processing systems to hipaa electronic transaction requirements 
while we believe we are currently compliant with these regulations  we cannot be certain of the extent to which the enforcement or interpretation of these regulations will affect our business 
our continuing compliance with these regulations  therefore  may have a significant impact on our business operations and may be at material cost in the event we are subject to these regulations 
sanctions for failing to comply with standards issued pursuant to hipaa include criminal and civil sanctions 
disruptions in our operations due to our reliance on our management information system may occur and could adversely affect our client relationships 
we manage certain information related to our consumer plan division membership on an administrative proprietary information system 
because it is a proprietary system  we do not rely on any third party for its support and maintenance 
there is no assurance that we will be able to continue operating without experiencing any disruptions in our operations or that our relationships with our members  marketing 
table of contents representatives or providers will not be adversely affected or that our internal controls will not be adversely affected 
we have many competitors and may not be able to compete effectively which may lead to a lack of revenues and discontinuance of our operations 
we compete with numerous well established companies that design and implement membership programs and other healthcare programs 
some of our competitors may be companies that have programs that are functionally similar or superior to our programs 
most of our competitors possess substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than us 
they may also have established reputations relating to their programs 
due to competitive market forces  we may experience price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share in the future  any of which would result in decreases in sales and revenues 
these decreases in revenues would adversely affect our business and results of operations and could lead to discontinuance of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully  our competitors will not develop programs that render our programs less marketable or even obsolete  or we will be able to successfully enhance our programs when necessary 
the recorded goodwill associated with our acquisitions of capella  icm and pme may become impaired and require a substantial write down and the recognition of an impairment expense 
in connection with our acquisitions of capella  foresight  icm and pme  we recorded goodwill that had a net aggregate asset value of  at december  this carrying value has been reduced through impairment charges of  in   in  and  in in the event that the goodwill is determined to be further impaired for any reason  we will be required to write down or reduce the value of the goodwill and recognize an additional impairment expense 
the impairment expense may be substantial in amount and  in such case  adversely affect the results of our operations for the applicable period and may negatively affect the market value of our common stock 
we may find it difficult to integrate icm s and pme s businesses and operations with our business and operations 
although we believe that icm s marketing and distribution of insurance products and financial services will complement and fit well with our business and the need for marketing of our healthcare savings programs and third party claims administration services  insurance marketing s business is relatively new to us 
our unfamiliarity with this business may make it more difficult to integrate icm s operations with ours 
we will not achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger acquisition unless we successfully integrate icm s operations 
there can be no assurance that this will occur 
similarly  we believe that pme s marketing and distribution of dental and vision network access and non insurance medical discount programs will complement and fit well with our consumer plan division 
we will not achieve the anticipated benefits of that acquisition unless we successfully integrate the pme operations 
there can be no assurance that this will occur 
we are dependent on third party service providers and the failure of such service providers to adequately provide services to us could affect our financial results because such failure could affect our relationship with our customers 
as a cost efficiency measure  we have entered into agreements with third parties for their provision of services to us in exchange for a monthly fee normally calculated on a per member basis 
these services 
table of contents include the enrollment of members through different media  operation of a member services call center  claims administration  billing and collection services  and the production and distribution of fulfillment member marketing materials 
one of these is our agreement with lifeguard emergency travel  inc lifeguard for the provision of these services to many of our members and prospective members 
we are also dependent upon third party data processing and administrative service providers for the processing of commission revenue and expense for our insurance marketing division 
as a result of these outsourcing arrangements  we may lose direct control over key functions and operations 
the failure by lifeguard or any of our other third party service providers to perform the services to the same or similar level of quality that we could provide could adversely affect our relationships with our members  customers  marketing representatives and our ability to retain and attract members  customers  marketing representatives and  accordingly  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
although we are transitioning the services provided to us by lifeguard to systems that we now own or manage as a result of our acquisition of pme  we will remain dependent on lifeguard for certain services until that transition is complete and for the accurate completion of the transition 
the availability of our insurance products and financial services are dependent on our strategic relationships with various insurance companies and the unavailability of those products and services for any reason may result in significant loss of revenues 
we are not an insurance company and only market and distribute insurance products and financial services developed and offered by insurance companies 
we must develop and maintain relationships with insurance companies that provide products and services for a particular market segment the elderly  the young family  etc 
that we in turn make available to the independent agents with whom they have contracted to sell the products and services to the individual consumer 
of the eight insurance companies with whom our insurance marketing division has strategic relationships  more than of insurance marketing s revenue and of icm s and revenue was attributable to the insurance products and financial services offered by five of the companies 
thus  we are dependent on a relatively small number of insurance companies to provide product and financial services for sale through our channels 
development and maintenance of relationships with the insurance companies may in part be based on professional relationships and the reputation of our management and marketing personnel 
consequently  the relationships with insurance companies may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  including departures of key personnel and alterations in professional relationships 
our success and growth depend in large part upon our ability to establish and maintain these strategic relationships  contractual or otherwise  with various insurance companies to provide their products and services  including those insurance products and financial services that may be developed in the future 
the loss or termination of these strategic relationships could adversely affect our revenues and operating results 
furthermore  the loss or termination may also impair our ability to maintain and attract new insurance agencies and their agents to distribute the insurance products and services that we offer 
we are dependent upon independent insurance agencies and their agents to offer and sell our insurance products and financial services 
we are principally dependent upon independent insurance agencies and their agents to offer and sell the insurance products and financial services that we offer and distribute 
these insurance agencies and their agents may offer and distribute insurance products and financial services that are competitive with ours 
these independent agencies and their agents may give higher priority and greater incentives financial or otherwise to other insurance products or financial services  reducing their efforts devoted to marketing and distribution of the insurance products and financial services that we offer 
also  our ability to attract and retain independent insurance agencies could be negatively affected by adverse publicity relating to our products and services or our operations 
furthermore  of the approximately  independent agents with whom our insurance marketing division has active distribution and marketing relationships  more than of insurance marketing s revenues 
table of contents are attributable to the product sales and financial services through approximately  independent insurance agents 
these agents report through approximately independent general agencies 
thus  we are dependent on a small number of independent insurance agencies for a very significant percentage of our total insurance products and financial services revenue 
development and maintenance of the relationships with independent insurance agencies and their agents may in part be based on professional relationships and the reputation of our management and marketing personnel 
consequently  these relationships may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  including departures of key personnel and alterations in professional relationships 
the loss of a significant number of the independent insurance agencies and their agents  as well as the loss of a key agency or its agents  for any reason  could adversely affect our revenue and operating results  or could impair our ability to establish new relationships or continue strategic relationships with independent insurance agencies and their agents 
we face intense competition in the marketplace for our products and services as well as competition for insurance agencies and their agents for the marketing of the products and services offered 
instead of utilizing captive or wholly owned insurance agencies for the offer and sale of our products and services  we utilize independent insurance agencies and their agents as the principal marketing and distribution channel 
competition for independent insurance agencies and their agents is intense 
also  competition from products and services similar to or directly in competition with the products and services that we offer is intense  including those products and services offered and sold through the same channels utilized for distribution of our insurance products and financial services 
under arrangements with the independent insurance agencies  the agencies and their agents may offer and sell a variety of insurance products and financial services  including those that compete with the insurance products and financial services that we offer 
thus  our business operations compete in two channels of competition 
first  we compete based upon the insurance products and financial services offered 
this competition includes products and services of insurance companies that compete with the products and services of the insurance companies that we offer and sell 
second  we compete with all types of marketing and distribution companies throughout the us for independent insurance agencies and their agents 
many of our competitors have substantially larger bases of insurance companies providing products and services  and longer term established relationships with independent insurance agencies and agents for the sale and distribution of products and services  as well as greater financial and other resources 
there is no assurance that our competitors will not provide insurance products and financial services comparable or superior to those products and services that we offer at lower costs or prices  greater sales incentives financial or otherwise or adapt more quickly to evolving insurance industry trends or changing industry requirements 
increased competition may result in reduced margins on product sales and services  less than anticipated sales or reduced sales  and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop and distribute quality affordable consumer driven healthcare programs for individuals  families  affinity groups and employer groups across the nation 
our products and programs are designed to deal with the rising costs of healthcare 
these products and plans include health insurance plans and non insurance healthcare discount programs to provide solutions for the millions of americans who can no longer afford or do not have access to traditional health insurance coverage 
the current organization of our business  including our new insurance marketing division  is a result of our january  merger with insurance capital management usa  inc icm 
as a result of this merger  and to properly reflect our broadened mission of providing access to affordable healthcare for all americans  we changed our name from precis  inc to access plans usa  inc 
beginning in  our 
table of contents operations are organized under three business divisions  consumer plans  insurance marketing and regional healthcare consumer plan division 
we offer savings on healthcare services throughout the united states to persons who are uninsured and under insured 
these savings are offered by accessing the same preferred provider organizations ppos that are utilized by many insurance companies 
we design these programs to benefit healthcare providers as well as the network members 
providers commonly give reduced or preferred rates to ppo networks in exchange for steerage of patients 
however  the providers must still file claim forms and wait to days to be paid for their services 
our programs utilize these same networks to obtain comparable savings for our program members 
however  the healthcare providers are paid immediately for their services and are not required to file claim forms 
we provide transaction facilitation services to both the program member and the healthcare provider 
these programs are sold primarily through third party marketers 
memberships in these programs are offered and sold by direct marketing through direct sales or in bound direct marketing 
we believe that our clients  their members and the vendors of the products and services offered through the programs all benefit from our membership service programs 
the products and services are bundled  priced and marketed utilizing relationship marketing strategies or inbound direct marketing to target the profiled needs of the clients particular member base 
our memberships sold by third party organizations are generally marketed using the third party s name or brand 
we refer to these programs and membership sales as wholesale programs or private label programs 
each of the private label programs can bundle our services to fit the needs of their consumers 
we also sell consumer healthcare discount programs through independent marketing representatives imrs  primarily under the usa healthcare savings and care entr e tm brands 
our imrs may enroll as representatives by paying an enrollment fee and signing a standard representative agreement 
we pay independent marketing representatives commissions equal to of the membership fees of members they enroll for the life of that member s enrollment 
imrs may also recruit other representatives and earn override commissions on sales made by those recruited representatives 
in the first month of a membership sale  no override commissions are paid to the representative s upline 
the total regular or ongoing commission payout  including overrides on monthly membership sales after the enrollment month and our contribution to the bonus pools  is up to of qualified membership sales 
insurance marketing division 
operating results for the insurance marketing division are only for the months following completion of our merger with icm on january  however  icm s results prior to acquisition are discussed below for comparative purposes 
revenue 
we generate most of our revenue in this segment from commissions paid to us by health insurance carriers whose health insurance policies we have sold 
commission and fee revenue represented of our total revenue in this segment for the year ended december  the remainder of our revenue is primarily attributable to interest earned on commissions advanced to agents 
our commission revenue has grown principally as a result of recruitment of a growing number of agents and the resulting penetration of the individual  family and small business health insurance markets  driving a corresponding growth in the number of policies in force 
we estimate that as of december  we had approximately  policies in force compared to an estimated  policies in force at december  policyholder acquisition 
an important factor in our revenue growth is the growth of our policyholder base 
our strategy for growing the number of policies in force and  therefore  revenue is to continue to recruit new agents and retain the current agents selling our products and services and also continue to provide increasingly valuable services to insurance agents and their agencies  continue to use technology and innovative marketing and agent support programs to attract new agents to sell products that are available to us  continue to develop products for consumers to provide healthcare savings and or insurance protection to families and individuals  
table of contents enhance the product portfolio we distribute by adding new products developed on our current product platform  expand into new states where we are not currently marketing to any significant degree  and expand the number of insurance carriers we represent 
regional healthcare division 
for governments and other large  self funded employers seeking to reduce their costs for providing employee healthcare benefits  we offer a more streamlined version of our healthcare products and programs 
in these cases  we offer access to healthcare through our network of providers and the efficient repricing of bills through our proprietary systems 
we can offer these services on a price based on either the number of participants per month or as a percentage of savings on healthcare costs actually realized 
through foresight  we provide a wide range of healthcare claims administration services and other cost containment procedures that are frequently required by governments and other employers who have chosen to self fund their employee healthcare benefits 
with the services of foresight  we offer a more complete suite of healthcare services 
we are able to provide individuals and employee groups access to preferred provider networks  medical savings accounts and full third party administration capabilities to adjudicate and pay medical claims 
foresight s primary area of expertise is in the public sector market 
financial services discontinued

care financial offered high deductible and scheduled benefit insurance policies and care offered life insurance and annuities  along with healthcare savings accounts hsas  healthcare reimbursement arrangements hras and medical and dependent care flexible spending accounts fsas 
care was discontinued in december and care financial s results of operations for were immaterial and are now included in the corporate and other segment

memberships in these programs were offered and sold as part of a point of sale transaction or by direct marketing through direct mail or as inserts 
program members are offered and provided our third party vendors products and services 
the products and services were bundled  priced and marketed to target the profiled needs of the clients particular customer base 
most of our club membership programs were sold by third party organizations  generally in connection with a point of sale transaction 
we referred to these programs and membership sales as wholesale programs 
in december  we sold substantially all of the assets of this subsidiary and discontinued its operations 
critical accounting policies basis of presentation 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and include the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries  capella  insuraco  and foresight 
all significant inter company accounts and transactions have been eliminated 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior period financial statements to conform to the current presentation of the financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain significant estimates are required in the evaluation of goodwill and intangible assets for impairment as well as allowances for doubtful recoveries of advanced agent commissions and accounts and notes receivable 
actual results could differ from those estimates and the differences could be material 
fair value of financial instruments 
the recorded amounts of short term investments  accounts receivable  income taxes receivable  notes receivable  accounts payable  accrued liabilities  income taxes payable  capital lease obligations and debt approximate fair value because of the short term maturity of these items 

table of contents recently issued accounting standards 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r fas r  business combinations  which revises fas and changes multiple aspects of the accounting for business combinations 
under the guidance in fas r  the acquisition method must be used  which requires the acquirer to recognize most identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and non controlling interests in the acquiree at their full fair value on the acquisition date 
goodwill is to be recognized as the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of the non controlling interest over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired 
subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as a liability are to be recognized in earnings  while contingent consideration classified as equity is not to be re measured 
costs such as transaction costs are to be excluded from acquisition accounting  generally leading to recognizing expense  and  additionally  restructuring costs that do not meet certain criteria at acquisition date are to be subsequently recognized as post acquisition costs 
fas r is effective for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact that this issuance will have on its financial position and results of operation 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements  that provides enhanced guidance for using fair value measurements in financial reporting 
while the standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstance  it has applicability to several current accounting standards that require or permit entities to measure assets and liabilities at fair value 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
application of this standard is required beginning in in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 that is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value on specified election dates 
this election  which may be applied on an instrument by instrument basis  is typically irrevocable once elected 
subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings 
management is currently assessing the potential impact  if any  the application of these standards could have on our financial statements 
in fiscal year  we adopted securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying current year misstatements 
sab no 
requires companies to quantify misstatements using both a balance sheet iron curtain and an income statement rollover approach to evaluate whether either approach results in an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors  and provides for a one time cumulative effect transition adjustment 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have an impact on our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
revenue recognition varies based on source 
consumer plan division revenues 
we recognize consumer plan program membership revenues  other than initial enrollment fees  ratably over the membership month 
membership revenues are reduced by the amount of estimated refunds 
for members that are billed directly  the billed amount is collected almost entirely by electronic charge to the members credit cards  automated clearinghouse or electronic check 
the settlement of those charges occurs within a day or two 
under certain private label arrangements  our private label partners bill their members for the membership fees and our portion of the membership fees is periodically remitted to us 
during the time from the billing of these private label membership fees and the remittance to us of those amounts  we record a receivable from the private label partners and record an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts 
the allowance of uncollectible receivables is based upon review of the aging of outstanding balances  the creditworthiness of the private label partner and its history of paying the agreed amounts owed 
membership enrollment fees  net of direct costs  are deferred and amortized over the estimated membership period that averages eight to ten months 
independent marketing representative fees  net of direct 
table of contents costs  are deferred and amortized over the term of the applicable contract 
judgment is involved in the allocation of costs to determine the direct costs netted against those deferred revenues  as well as in estimating the membership period over which to amortize such net revenue 
we maintain a statistical analysis of the costs and membership periods as a basis for adjusting these estimates from time to time 
insurance marketing division revenues 
the revenue of our insurance marketing division is primarily from sales commissions due from the insurance companies we represent 
these sales commissions are generally a percentage of the commissionable insurance premium and other related amounts charged and collected by the insurance companies 
commission income and policy fees  other than enrollment fees  and corresponding commission expense payable to agents  are generally recognized at their gross amount  as earned on a monthly basis  until such time as the underlying policyholder contract is terminated 
advanced commissions received are recorded as unearned commission revenue and are recognized in income as earned 
initial enrollment fees are deferred and amortized over the estimated lives of the respective policies 
the estimated weighted average life for the policies sold ranges from to months  and is based upon our historical policyholder contract termination experience 
our commission revenue generally represents a percentage of the insurance premium a policyholder pays to his or her insurance carrier and  to a lesser extent  additional incentive payments that insurance carriers pay us for achieving sales volume thresholds or other objectives 
commission rates vary by carrier and by the type of plan purchased by a policyholder 
commission rates also may vary based upon the amount of time that the policy has been active  with commission rates for individual and family policies typically being higher in the first months of the policy 
individuals  families and small businesses purchasing health insurance through us typically pay their premiums on a monthly basis 
insurance carriers typically pay us our commissions monthly  after they receive the premium payment from the member 
we continue to receive the commission payment from the relevant insurance carrier until the health insurance policy is cancelled or we otherwise do not remain the agent on the policy 
as a result  the majority of our revenue is recurring in nature and grows in correlation with the growth we experience in our policies in force 
commission income and policy fees  other than initial enrollment fees  and corresponding commission expense payable to agents who sell policies on our behalf  are generally recognized at their gross amount  as earned on a monthly basis  until such time as the underlying policyholder contract is terminated 
in some cases  we may receive an advance payment of commissions from the carrier  representing our expected commission on future premiums not yet collected or earned 
these advances are subject to repayment back to the carrier in the event that the policy lapses before the advanced commissions are collected and earned 
these advanced commissions are reflected on our balance sheet as unearned commissions 
similarly  we or the carrier may advance commissions to brokers and agents who sell for us 
these advances are subject to repayment back to us or to the carrier in the event that the policy lapses before the advanced commissions are collected and earned 
these commissions advanced to agents are reflected on our balance sheet as advanced agent commissions 
collection of the commissions advanced may be accomplished by withholding amounts due to the agents  plus accumulated interest  from future commissions on the policy upon which the advance was made  commissions on other policies sold by the agent or  in certain cases  commissions due to agents managing the agent to whom advances were made 
advanced agent commissions are reviewed on a quarterly basis to determine if any advanced agent commissions will likely be uncollectible 
an allowance is provided for any advanced agent commission balance where recovery is considered doubtful 
this allowance for uncollectible advances is based upon review of the aging of outstanding balances and estimates of future commissions expected to be due to the agents to whom advances are outstanding and the agents responsible for their management 
any bad debt is written off when determined uncollectible 
we recognize commission revenue when the commission is earned  based upon premiums collected and earned on the underlying policies in force 
these revenues are based upon amounts reported to us by a carrier  which occurs through our receipt of a cash payment and a commission statement 
incentive payments from carriers are recognized when we receive notice from the carrier that they have been earned and are generally reported to us in a more irregular pattern than premium commissions 
as a result  our revenue for a particular quarter could be higher or lower than expectations due to the timing of the reporting of commission override payments 

table of contents revenue attributable to individual and family major medical policies for the months ended december  represented approximately of our total revenue in the insurance marketing division 
additionally  revenue attributable to medicare supplemental policies for the eleven months ended december  represented approximately of our total revenues in the insurance marketing division 
in addition to the revenue we derive from commissions on the sale of health insurance products  we derive revenue from interest charged to agents on their outstanding advanced commissions and for the sale of leads to those agents 
regional healthcare division foresight revenues 
the principal sources of revenues of our regional healthcare division  foresight formerly access healthsource  inc  include administrative fees for third party claims administration  network provider fees for the preferred provider network and utilization and management fees 
these fees are based on monthly or per member per month fee schedules under specified contractual agreements 
revenues from these services are recognized in the periods in which the services are performed and when collection is reasonably assured 
commission expense 
commission expense varies based upon source 
consumer plan 
commissions on consumer plan division revenues are accrued in the month in which a member has enrolled in the program 
these commissions are only paid to our independent marketing representatives in the month following our receipt of the related membership fees by us 
in  we began issuing advances of commissions on certain consumer plan programs to increase sales representative recruitment 
insurance marketing 
commission expenses for the insurance marketing division consist primarily of commissions payable to agents and are generally recognized at their gross amount  as earned on a monthly basis  until such time as the underlying policyholder contract is terminated 
advances of commissions up to one year are paid to agents in the insurance marketing division based on certain insurance policy premium commissions 
collection of the commissions advanced may be accomplished by withholding amounts due to the agents for future commissions on the policy upon which the advance was made  commissions on other policies sold by the agent or  in certain cases  commissions due to agents managing the agent to whom advances were made 
we periodically assess the collectibility of the amounts outstanding for commission advances and record an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts 
this allowance for uncollectible advances is based upon review of the aging of outstanding balances and estimates of future commissions expected to be due to the agents to whom advances are outstanding and the agents responsible for their management 
acquisition costs 
certain policy acquisition costs  including lead expenses for sales of major medical policies  are capitalized and amortized over the estimated lives of the respective policies 
the estimated weighted average life for the policies sold ranges from to months  and is based upon our historical policyholder contract termination experience 
advanced agent commissions 
our insurance marketing division advances agent commissions for certain insurance programs 
collection of the commissions advanced plus accrued interest is accomplished by withholding amounts due to the agents for future commissions on the policy upon which the advance was made  commissions on other policies sold by the agent or  in certain cases  commissions due to agents managing the agent to whom advances were made 
advanced agent commissions are reviewed on a quarterly basis to determine if any advanced agent commissions will likely be uncollectible 
an allowance is provided for the estimated advanced agent commission balance for which recovery is considered doubtful 
this allowance for uncollectible advances requires judgment and is based upon review of the aging of outstanding balances and estimates of future commissions expected to be due to the agents to whom advances are outstanding and the agents responsible for their management 
any bad debt is written off when determined uncollectible 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable generally represent commissions and fees due from insurance carriers and plan sponsors 
accounts receivable are reviewed on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables will be potentially uncollectible 
an allowance is provided for any accounts receivable balance where recovery is considered to be doubtful 
any bad debt is written off when determined uncollectible 

table of contents acquisitions 
on january   we completed our merger with icm 
under the terms of the merger  the shareholders of icm received  shares of our common stock 
the assets and liabilities acquired were initially valued  in the aggregate net amount of  based upon the market value of the common stock issued as the merger consideration in the acquisition 
judgment was required in the allocation of value to the acquired assets and liabilities  based upon their fair values  especially with regard to the allocation of  to goodwill and  to other intangible assets 
these other intangible assets represent the estimated value  at the date of their acquisition  of policies in force customer contracts of  and certain agent relationships agent relationships of  these assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over three years and eight years  respectively 
goodwill is deemed to have an infinite life and is subject to an annual  or more frequent  analysis for possible impairment discussed below 
on october   we completed our acquisition of pme 
pme offers  as a wholesaler  discount medical service products  provides back office support through its use of various operating systems  maintains a customer service facility  and develops products from both its proprietary networks of dental and vision providers contracted and third party provider networks 
the  purchase price of pme was cash consideration paid to pme s parent  protective life corporation 
judgment was required in the allocation of value to the acquired assets and liabilities  based upon their fair values  especially with regard to the allocation of  to other intangible assets 
the other intangible assets included memberships in force customer contracts having an estimated value of  and dental and vision provider network contracts network contracts having an estimated value of  these assets are being amortized on a straight line basis over four years and eight years  respectively

previously  we had performed this assessment as of the end of our fiscal year december 
however  we determined that it was preferable to perform the annual assessment as of september of this and subsequent years  to allow us to incorporate into that analysis  and give most timely effect to  the budgets and forecasts for the coming year that we develop during our fourth quarter budgeting process 
additionally  performing the assessment of goodwill for impairment as of september of each year will reduce the burden on us and our professional advisors during the period immediately following our fiscal year 
table of contents end  when we prepare our audited year end financial statements and evaluation of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to sarbanes oxley section as the result of those annual and in some cases  interim assessments of goodwill impairment  we have recorded impairment charges as follows dollars in thousands capella foresight icm total goodwill originally recorded other goodwill adjustments impairment charges impairment charges impairment charges net goodwill balance at december  impairment charges were recorded related to capella s goodwill in due to the continuing declines in the number of members and related revenues to a lower level than previously predicted and pending litigation and regulatory activity that was announced in the second quarter of that year 
impairment charges were again recorded in and related to capella s goodwill due to continuing decline in members and revenues and the failure of certain new product and marketing initiatives to achieve expected results 
in and  we recorded goodwill impairment charges for foresight due to the loss of significant contracts 
in we recorded impairment charges for insurance marketing due to significant declines in sales of medicare supplemental policies 
significant judgments and estimates were required in connection with the impairment test to determine the estimated future cash flows and fair value of the reporting unit 
we engaged an independent valuation consultant to assist management with our estimate of the fair values of foresight and capella using discounted cash flow projections and other valuation methodologies in evaluating and measuring a potential goodwill impairment charges 
to the extent that  in the future  our estimates change or our stock price decreases  further goodwill write downs may occur 
those assessments of the carrying value of goodwill were each reviewed and approved by the audit committee of our board of directors 
these impairments are discussed in more detail in the notes to consolidated financial statements

 accounting for stock based compensation  and b compensation cost for all share based payments currently granted based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the binomial lattice option pricing model is used to estimate the option fair values 
the option pricing model requires a number of assumptions  of which the most significant are expected stock price volatility  the expected pre vesting forfeiture rate and the risk free interest rate 
expected volatility was calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent period ended december  equal to the expected option term 
expected pre vesting forfeitures were estimated based on actual historical pre vesting forfeitures over the most recent period ended december  for the expected option term 
the risk free interest rate was based on the interest rate of zero coupon united states treasury securities over the expected option term 
income taxes 
income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related primarily to differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting 
the net deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled 
as of december   we evaluated the probability of recognizing the benefit of deferred tax assets through the reduction of taxes otherwise payable in the future 
we determined that a valuation allowance to fully offset deferred tax assets remained appropriate as of december  
table of contents on july   the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes guidance to address inconsistencies among entities with the measurement and recognition in accounting for income tax positions for financial statement purposes 
specifically  fin addresses the timing of the recognition of income tax benefits 
fin requires the financial statement recognition of an income tax benefit when the company determines that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be ultimately sustained 
we adopted the provisions of fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin on january  and it had no material effect on our financial statements

a federal audit for has been completed with no change to our tax liability 
the texas audit of capella for the years through has been concluded with no material change to our tax provision 
we have elected to recognize penalties and interest related to tax liabilities as a component of income tax expense and income taxes payable 
fixed assets 
property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets for financial reporting purposes 
leasehold improvements are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives or the lease term  whichever is shorter 
ordinary maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
expenditures that extend the physical or economic life of property and equipment are capitalized 
the estimation of useful lives is based  in part  upon past experience with similar assets and upon our plans for the utilization of the assets in the future 
we periodically review fixed assets  including software  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable or their depreciation or amortization periods should be accelerated 
when any value impairment is determined to exist  the related assets are written down to their fair value 
if we determine that the remaining useful life  based upon known events and circumstances  should be shortened  the depreciation or amortization of the related asset is adjusted on a prospective  going forward basis based upon the shortened useful lives 
reclassifications 
certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation 
summary results of operations we incurred a net loss for of  compared to net losses of  in and  in these losses arose primarily from goodwill impairment charges of   and  in  and  respectively

during  we completed two significant acquisitions  merging with insurance capital management icm in january in a stock transaction and acquiring protective marketing inc pme in october in a cash transaction 
the merger with icm created our insurance marketing division  described below  that provides wholesale distribution of a broad range of health insurance products through national networks of independent agents

table of contents  unfortunately  our existing consumer plan operations continued to suffer from attrition in membership  with corresponding declines in revenues and pre tax earnings exclusive of goodwill impairment charges 
also  our regional healthcare division in el paso continued to suffer the negative impact  in declining revenue and earnings  of the loss of certain significant contracts and the expenses resulting from a federal investigation of the el paso operation and its former ceo 
additional membership and revenue reductions are anticipated to occur in that division during to date  expense reductions have been less than the corresponding revenue declines  in part due to the re branding of the division as foresight tpa and commencement of marketing campaigns  led by michael puestow  the division s new chief executive officer hired during august  targeting the generation of new sources of revenue for on a consolidated basis  we achieved revenue of  up  or from  and posted a net loss of  that included goodwill impairment charges of consumer plan division

during the latter part of the year  the consumer plan division refocused its efforts toward integrating and leveraging the pme operation  which we acquired effective october  pme membership count at december  consisted of  retail plan customers with an average revenue per member per month of  slightly higher than the division s  capella members and an additional  wholesale customers which have average revenue of less than per member per month who have purchased access to the pme proprietary dental and vision networks 
prior to our acquisition of pme  its former parent company had announced the winding down of its operations and put its consumer plan resellers on notice that they would no longer support the consumer plans 
concurrent with our acquisition of pme  we rescinded that notice and have been actively engaging those resellers  and other potential resellers of pme s plans  in discussions regarding resumed and expanded marketing of those plans 
additionally  pme has a portfolio of proprietary products  discount card services and marketing expertise that we believe will complement and create cross selling opportunities for our consumer medical discount products and managed care services 
we 
table of contents also plan to reduce operating costs and enhance our consumer plan customer service and other administrative capabilities by vertically integrating pme s product development and administrative functions into our existing operations 
while the capella membership count totaled  at december   down from december  compared to a decline of during  the majority of that decline in member count came from memberships sold through our network marketing sales channel  where the decline in membership was for and for currently  the majority of our new member enrollments come from private label resellers  rather than network marketing independent marketing representatives 
while member counts have also declined in that channel  they declined only by during and increased by during however  our margins are substantially less on memberships sold through that channel as compared to memberships sold through network marketing 
in spite of the decline  from to  in revenue attributable to memberships sold through network marketing  commissions expense  which relates almost entirely to that channel  only declined by 
commencing with the merger with icm in january  revenues of  and associated costs for their consumer healthcare discount products were included in our results 
those products accounted for  of the members reflected above as of december  the average revenue on those products is substantially higher than our other consumer plans  but so are their costs  resulting in very limited margins 
this reduced the decline in division revenues that otherwise would have occurred during  but contributed to an increase in the cost of operations as well as the increase in commission expense as a percentage of revenue 
additionally  costs incurred for new product development efforts and conversions to new administrative platforms contributed to the increase in the cost of operations 
therefore  costs of operations in this division increased by from to compared to a decrease in those expenses from to sales and marketing expenses decreased from to  compared to a increase from to  primarily due to elimination of marketing consultants and contractors formerly used  prior to the icm merger

however  icm s results prior to acquisition are discussed below for comparative purposes 
the revenue of our insurance marketing division is primarily from sales commissions paid by the insurance companies it represents  these sales commissions are generally a percentage of premium revenue 
substantially all of our revenues in the insurance marketing division are derived from commissions on premiums paid by policyholders for major medical or medicare supplemental health insurance policies 
our processing and recording of commission revenues earned and commission expenses payable to agents are key determinants of material revenues and expenses reported in our financial statements 
this processing and recording of commission revenue and expense  together with the accurate and timely disbursement of commission payments to agents  is dependent upon our timely receipt of complete and accurate information about such commissions from the insurance carriers whose policies we sell 
our failure to receive this commission information in a timely  complete and accurate fashion could adversely impact our ability to pay commissions in a timely and accurate manner or to state revenues or expenses in our financial statements in a materially correct manner 
during the months since our merger with icm  the insurance marketing division has experienced growth in the sale of major medical insurance policies approximately over the months  but a decline in the sale of medicare supplemental policies approximately over that same period 
the growth in major medical policy sales arose from our continuing recruitment of agents as well as the development of additional products  some with new carriers such as guarantee trust life and golden rule insurance company 
as the table above reflects  although there are seasonal fluctuations in the trend  the volume of new policies sold has trended upward over the last three years 
this is reflected in the increases in new issued policies and the growth in the number of policies in force at the end of the successive periods 
a leading indicator of policies issued  and therefore  policies in force and commission revenue  is the annualized premium for applications submitted on new policies for each period 
growth in the annualized premium for applications submitted typically foreshadows growth in the annualized premium of policies issued and  therefore  growth in the number  premiums and commissions to us on policies in force 
since policies  once issued  tend to stay in force for a period of up to to months  policy issuance in excess of 
table of contents policy lapses grows the number of policies in force 
if all other things including commission rate and average premium are equal  this tends to have a positive effect on future commission revenue and expense for several subsequent quarters 
unfortunately  developments in the medicare supplemental insurance or medigap markets have led to declining revenues and earnings in that part of our business 
there are standardized medicare supplemental insurance plans a through l also called medigap plans 
each plan has different benefits 
within each standardized medicare supplemental insurance plan  benefits are identical from one carrier to the next 
therefore  competition in this market has focused on premium cost to the insured  resulting in thinner margins and lower compensation to selling agents and intermediaries 
while we still have nearly  of these policies in force  issuance of new policies has rapidly declined during as a result  commission revenue for these products has declined throughout accordingly  we have decided to not emphasize this part of our business  while continuing to service in force policies 
in the third quarter of  in conjunction with our annual assessment of possible impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  we determined that these deteriorating sales prospects for medicare supplemental policies indicated a decline in the future earnings projections for acp  our subsidiary within which that business operates 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment expense of  within our insurance marketing division 
as discussed in item business  above  we serve as an intermediary between the health insurance carriers several of whom we represent and the agents who ultimately sell the carriers policies 
we provide the agents with access to multiple carriers  web based technology  leads for new prospective customers  advances of up to months of future commissions and home office support 
the revenue of our insurance marketing division is primarily from sales commissions due from the insurance companies we represent 
these sales commissions are generally a percentage of the commissionable insurance premium and other related amounts charged and collected by the insurance companies 
commission income and policy fees  other than enrollment fees  and corresponding commission expense payable to agents  are generally recognized at their gross amount  as earned on a monthly basis  until such time as the underlying policyholder contract is terminated 
advanced commissions received are recorded as unearned commission revenue and are recognized in income as earned 
initial enrollment fees are deferred and amortized over the estimated lives of the respective policies 
the estimated weighted average life for the policies sold ranges from to months  and is based upon our historical policyholder contract termination experience 
as reflected in the table appearing under item business distribution channels and operating divisions  above  we represent over eight health insurance carriers 
the gross and net amounts of commissions that we receive on premiums for policies vary significantly among those carriers 
therefore  the net commission revenue  or margin  that we receive will also vary between carriers and their products 
additionally  some of those carriers directly advance commissions to our agents on our behalf 
as a result  the cost and capital requirements for our commission advancing activities can vary significantly between the various insurance products sold 
as of december   our agents were obligated to us and the carriers in the aggregate amount of  net of the allowance discussed below for future commissions that had been advanced to them 
in turn  as of december  we were obligated to the carriers in the aggregate amount of  for future commissions that had been advanced to us and our agents by the carriers 
additionally  as of december   we were obligated to lenders in the aggregate amount of  for amounts borrowed  primarily to finance the advances to agents that were not in turn advanced to us or the agents by the carriers 
collection of the commissions advanced may be accomplished by withholding amounts due to the agents  plus accumulated interest  from future commissions on the policy upon which the advance was made  commissions on other policies sold by the agent or  in certain cases  commissions due to agents managing the agent to whom advances were made 
advanced agent commissions are reviewed periodically to determine if any advanced agent commissions will likely be uncollectible 
an allowance is provided for any advanced agent commission balance where recovery is considered doubtful 
the aggregate amount of those allowances as of december  was  during the eleven months ended december   we provided  of that allowance through a charge to operations 
this allowance for uncollectible advances required judgment and is based upon review of the aging of outstanding balances and estimates of future commissions

this decline is due primarily to the assumption of liabilities in the acquisition of icm 
other than our  capital lease obligations  we do not have any capital commitments

on march   we entered into a financing arrangement with a specialty lender for financing of up to  to extinguish existing debt and to provide additional working capital  including financing for advances of commissions to agents 
this debt must be repaid in monthly installments over months 
see a further discussion of this borrowing arrangement at item b 
other information 
as the result of that arrangement  we have access to a sufficient amount of working capital to meet our needs  but our ability to grow this segment will depend on our ability to gain access to increasing amounts of working capital sources 
growth in our insurance marketing division may necessitate additional financing to fund future advances 
additionally  if we incur losses from the operation of our regional healthcare division  our cash and working capital may be reduced or consumed 
we are attempting to modify our arrangements for clearing credit card charges so that less cash will be required to be pledged to our clearing service providers 
however  there is no assurance that those efforts will be successful 
because our capital requirements cannot be predicted with certainty  there is no assurance that we will not require any additional financing during the next twelve months  and if required  that any additional financing will be available on terms satisfactory to us or advantageous to our stockholders
