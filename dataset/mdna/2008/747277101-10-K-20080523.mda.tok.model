our network products consist primarily of fibre channel switches  including core  blade and stackable switches  infiniband switches  including edge fabric switches and multi protocol fabric directors  and storage routers for bridging fibre channel and iscsi networks 
our silicon products consist primarily of protocol chips and management controllers 
all of these solutions address the storage area network  or san  or server fabric connectivity infrastructure requirements of small  medium and large enterprises 
our products based on infiniband technology are designed for the emerging high performance computing  or hpc  environments 
our products are incorporated in solutions from a number of oem customers  including cisco systems  inc  dell inc  emc corporation  hitachi data systems  hewlett packard company  international business machines corporation  network appliance  inc  sun microsystems  inc 
and many others 
we use a fifty two fifty three week fiscal year ending on the sunday nearest march fiscal years  and each comprised fifty two weeks 
business combinations silverstorm technologies in november  we acquired silverstorm technologies  inc silverstorm by merger for total cash consideration of million 
the acquisition of silverstorm expanded our portfolio of infiniband solutions to include edge fabric switches and multi protocol fabric directors 

table of contents based on a preliminary purchase price allocation  we allocated the total purchase consideration to the tangible assets  liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired as well as purchased in process research and development ipr d  based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill 
none of the goodwill resulting from this acquisition will be tax deductible 
we are in the process of finalizing the determination of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax benefits from the acquisition and expect to complete this analysis in fiscal  which may result in certain adjustments to goodwill 
pathscale in april  we acquired pathscale  inc pathscale by merger for total consideration of million 
the acquisition of pathscale expanded our portfolio to include infiniband solutions 
based on the purchase price allocation  we allocated the total purchase consideration to the tangible assets  liabilities and identifiable intangible assets acquired as well as ipr d based on their respective fair values at the acquisition date 
the excess of the purchase price over the aggregate fair values was recorded as goodwill 
none of the goodwill resulting from this acquisition will be tax deductible 
we also entered into performance plans with certain former pathscale employees who became employees of qlogic as of the acquisition date 
the performance plans provide for the issuance of qlogic common stock based on the achievement of certain performance milestones and continued employment with qlogic 
in connection with the performance plans  we recognized million and million of compensation expense during fiscal and  respectively  and could recognize up to million of additional compensation expense through april troika networks in november  we completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of troika networks  inc troika for million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the acquisition of troika expanded our product line and  through the acquired intellectual property  enhanced certain of our existing products 
based on a preliminary purchase price allocation in fiscal  we recorded goodwill of million and core technology of million and recognized a charge of million for ipr d 
during fiscal  we finalized our valuation of the intangible assets acquired resulting in an increase in core technology of million  an increase in ipr d of million and a corresponding decrease in goodwill of million 
as this acquisition was an asset purchase  the goodwill resulting from this acquisition will be tax deductible 
in addition  we entered into a performance plan with certain former troika employees upon their employment with qlogic 
the performance plan provided for the issuance of qlogic common stock based on the achievement of certain performance milestones and continued employment with qlogic 
in connection with the performance plan  we recognized million and million of compensation expense during fiscal and  respectively 
during fiscal  we determined that the criteria for payment to the former troika employees would not be met and reversed the previously recognized stock based compensation expense  aggregating million  that would not be paid 
in august  we reevaluated the use of the intellectual property acquired from troika 
as a result  we suspended internal development of the underlying acquired technology and entered into a nonexclusive license of the technology with a third party 
in addition  we sold all of the related inventory and equipment to the licensee 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that the carrying amount of intangible assets previously acquired from troika exceeded the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets 
as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million  as a component of cost of revenues  to write down the carrying value of the core technology to its estimated fair value 
stock based compensation as of the beginning of fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for 
table of contents all share based payment awards made to employees and non employee directors including stock options  restricted stock units and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan based on estimated fair values 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method and consequently have not retroactively adjusted results from prior periods 
a summary of stock based compensation expense  excluding stock based compensation related to acquisitions  for fiscal and recorded under sfas no 
r by functional line item is as follows in millions cost of revenues engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative stock based compensation expense related to acquisitions of million and million for fiscal and  respectively  is excluded from the above table 
during fiscal  we recorded stock based compensation expense of million related to acquisitions 
discontinued operations in november  we completed the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business  or the discontinued business  to marvell technology group ltd 
marvell for cash and shares of marvell s common stock 
as a result of this transaction  all financial information related to the discontinued business has been presented as discontinued operations 
the following discussion and analysis excludes the discontinued business and amounts related to the discontinued business unless otherwise noted 
fiscal year and fourth quarter financial highlights and other information during fiscal  our net revenues increased to million from million in fiscal and were highlighted by increases in net revenues from host products and network products of and  respectively 
revenue from silicon products decreased by million  or 
a summary of the key factors and significant events which impacted our financial performance during the fourth quarter of fiscal are as follows net revenues of million for the fourth quarter of fiscal increased by million  or  from million in the fourth quarter of fiscal revenues from host products and network products increased from the comparable quarter in the prior year by and  respectively 
in addition  other revenues increased by million from the fourth quarter of fiscal due primarily to an increase in royalty revenue 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues of for the fourth quarter of fiscal  increased from for the fourth quarter of fiscal the gross profit percentage for the fourth quarter of fiscal was impacted by the increase in royalty revenue  partially offset by the million impairment charge related to intangible assets 
operating income as a percentage of net revenues increased to for the fourth quarter of fiscal from in the fourth quarter of fiscal net income was million  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of fiscal and increased from million  or per diluted share  in the fourth quarter of fiscal net income included stock based compensation expense  acquisition related charges  impairment charges related to intangible assets and marketable securities  special charges  and the related income tax effects  totaling million for the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to million for the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at march  decreased million from million at april  this decrease is primarily due to million in repurchases of our common stock  partially offset by million of cash flow from operations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we generated million of cash from operating activities 
accounts receivable was million as of march   compared to million as of april  days sales outstanding dso in receivables as of march  increased to days from days as of april  our accounts receivable and dso are primarily affected by linearity of shipments within the quarter and collections performance 
inventories were million as of march   compared to million as of april  our annualized inventory turns in the fourth quarter of fiscal of turns increased from the turns in the fourth quarter of fiscal results of operations net revenues a summary of the components of our net revenues is as follows dollars in millions net revenues host products network products silicon products other total net revenues percentage of net revenues host products network products silicon products other total net revenues the global marketplace for storage networking solutions and network infrastructure solutions continues to expand in response to the information storage requirements of enterprise business environments  as well as the emerging market for solutions in hpc environments 
this market expansion has resulted in increased volume shipments of our host products and network products 
however  these markets have been characterized by rapid advances in technology and related product performance  which has generally resulted in declining average selling prices over time 
in general  our revenues have been favorably affected by increases in units sold as a result of market expansion and the release of new products 
the favorable effect on our revenues as a result of increases in volume has been partially offset by the impact of declining average selling prices 
our net revenues are derived primarily from the sale of host products and network products 
net revenues were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of a million  or  increase in revenue from host products and a million  or  increase in revenue from network products  partially offset by a million  or  decrease in revenue from silicon products 
the increase in revenue from host products was primarily due to a increase in the quantity of hbas sold partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of these products 
this hba volume increase was primarily driven by approximately a increase in the quantity of fibre channel mezzanine cards sold which are used in blade servers and have a lower average selling price than standard hba products 
the increase in revenue from network products was primarily due to the addition of infiniband switches to our product portfolio as a result 
table of contents of our acquisition of silverstorm  partially offset by a decrease in revenue from fibre channel switch products 
the decrease in fibre channel switch revenue was primarily due to a decline in revenue from our legacy and end of life products  which was not offset by revenue from our more recent product offerings until late fiscal the decrease in revenue from silicon products from the same period in the prior year was due primarily to an expected decrease in units sold 
net revenues for fiscal included million of other revenue compared with million of other revenue for fiscal other revenue  which primarily includes royalties and service fees  is unpredictable and we do not expect it to be significant to our overall revenues 
net revenues for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of an million  or  increase in revenue from host products and a million  or  increase in revenue from network products  partially offset by an million  or  decrease in revenue from silicon products 
the increase in revenue from host products was primarily due to a increase in the quantity of hbas sold partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of these products 
the increase in revenue from network products was primarily due to a increase in the number of units of fibre channel switches sold partially offset by a decrease in average selling prices of fibre channel switches 
the decrease in revenue from silicon products from the same period in the prior year was due primarily to a decrease in units sold 
net revenues for fiscal included million of other revenue compared with million of other revenue for fiscal a small number of our customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  and we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
our top ten customers accounted for  and of net revenues during fiscal  and  respectively 
a summary of our customers  including their manufacturing subcontractors  that represent or more of our net revenues for any of the fiscal years presented is as follows hewlett packard ibm sun microsystems we believe that our major customers continually evaluate whether or not to purchase products from alternative or additional sources 
additionally  customers economic and market conditions frequently change 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that a major customer will not reduce  delay or eliminate its purchases from us 
any such reduction  delay or loss of purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
revenues by geographic area are presented based upon the country of destination 
no individual country other than the united states represented or more of net revenues for any of the fiscal years presented 
net revenues by geographic area are as follows in millions united states europe  middle east and africa asia pacific and japan rest of world 
table of contents gross profit gross profit represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of the cost of purchased products  assembly and test services  costs associated with product procurement  inventory management and product quality  and the amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets 
a summary of our gross profit and related percentage of net revenues is as follows dollars in millions gross profit percentage of net revenues gross profit for fiscal decreased million from gross profit for fiscal the gross profit percentage for fiscal was and declined from for the prior year 
the decline in gross profit percentage was primarily impacted by a shift in product mix  including the addition of infiniband products as a result of our acquisition of silverstorm  and an increase of million in amortization and impairment of purchased intangible assets 
gross profit for fiscal increased million  or  from gross profit for fiscal  primarily due to the increase in net revenues 
the gross profit percentage for fiscal was and declined from for the prior year 
this decrease in gross profit percentage was due primarily to a million increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets related to our acquisitions and million of stock based compensation related to the adoption of sfas no 
r in fiscal the decline in gross profit percentage was also impacted by an unfavorable shift in product and technology mix  as well as a decrease in the average selling prices of our products 
our ability to maintain our current gross profit percentage can be significantly affected by factors such as the results of our investment in engineering and development activities  supply costs  the worldwide semiconductor foundry capacity  the mix of products shipped  the transition to new products  competitive price pressures  the timeliness of volume shipments of new products  the level of royalties received  our ability to achieve manufacturing cost reductions  and amortization and impairments of purchased intangible assets 
we anticipate that it will be increasingly difficult to reduce manufacturing costs 
as a result of these and other factors  it may be difficult to maintain our gross profit percentage consistent with historical periods and it may decline in the future 
operating expenses our operating expenses are summarized in the following table dollars in millions operating expenses engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative special charges purchased in process research and development total operating expenses percentage of net revenues engineering and development sales and marketing general and administrative special charges purchased in process research and development total operating expenses 
table of contents engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs  development related engineering and material costs  occupancy costs and related computer support costs 
during fiscal  engineering and development expenses decreased to million from million in fiscal the decrease in engineering and development expenses was due primarily to a decrease in acquisition related stock based compensation of million  a million decrease in new product development costs and a million decrease in cash compensation and related benefit costs 
these decreases resulted primarily from the consolidation and elimination of certain engineering activities 
see further discussion under special charges 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in stock based compensation  excluding acquisition related charges  a million increase in occupancy costs and related computer support costs  and a million increase in depreciation and equipment costs 
during fiscal  engineering and development expenses increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in engineering and development expenses was due primarily to million of stock based compensation  excluding stock based compensation related to acquisitions  in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r in fiscal  a million increase in cash compensation and related benefit costs associated with increases in headcount due to our acquisitions and in connection with our expanded development efforts in support of new products  a million increase in acquisition related stock based compensation  and a million increase in depreciation and equipment costs 
we believe continued investments in engineering and development activities are critical to achieving future design wins  expansion of our customer base and revenue growth opportunities 
we expect engineering and development expenses to increase in the future as a result of continued  and increasing costs associated with  new product development 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs  sales commissions  promotional activities and travel for sales and marketing personnel 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to a million decrease in promotional costs  including the costs for certain sales and marketing programs  and a decrease in stock based compensation of million  including stock based compensation related to acquisitions  partially offset by a million increase in amortization of purchased intangible assets related to the acquisition of silverstorm  an increase in depreciation and equipment costs of million  a million increase in cash compensation and related benefit costs and a million increase in travel related expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal the increase in sales and marketing expenses was due primarily to million of stock based compensation  excluding stock based compensation related to acquisitions  in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r in fiscal  a million increase in cash compensation and related benefit costs due to increased headcount associated with the expansion of our sales and marketing groups  a million increase in promotional costs  which included the costs for our worldwide partner conferences  trade shows and other marketing programs  amortization of purchased intangible assets of million related to customer relationships  and an increase in acquisition related stock based compensation charges of million 
we believe continued investments in our sales and marketing organizational infrastructure and related marketing programs are critical to the success of our strategy of expanding our customer base and enhancing relationships with our existing customers 
as a result  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in the future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related benefit costs for executive  finance  accounting  human resources  legal and information technology personnel 
non compensation components of general and administrative expenses include accounting  legal and other professional fees  facilities expenses and other corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was due primarily to a million increase in cash compensation and related benefit costs  a million increase in accounting and legal fees  and a million increase in bad debt expense 

table of contents general and administrative expenses for fiscal of million increased from million in fiscal primarily due to million of stock based compensation in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r in fiscal  an increase of million in cash compensation and related benefit costs due to increased headcount  and an increase of million in accounting and legal fees 
in connection with the anticipated growth of our business  we expect general and administrative expenses will increase in the future 
special charges 
during fiscal  we recorded special charges totaling million consisting of million of exit costs related to certain workforce reductions and the consolidation and elimination of certain activities  principally related to certain engineering functions and million for asset impairments 
the exit costs were comprised of workforce reductions  contract cancellation costs and other costs 
the workforce reduction costs were based on estimates of the cost of severance benefits for the affected employees and totaled million  of which million was paid as of march  contract cancellation and other costs totaled million and million of these costs were paid as of march  the remaining balances are expected to be paid over the terms of the related agreements  principally during fiscal purchased in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisitions  we recorded million of ipr d charges during fiscal the amounts allocated to ipr d were determined through established valuation techniques used in the high technology industry and were expensed upon acquisition as it was determined that the underlying projects had not reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses existed 
the fair value of the ipr d for each of the acquisitions was determined using the income approach 
under the income approach  the expected future cash flows from each project under development are estimated and discounted to their net present values at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
significant factors considered in the calculation of the rate of return are the weighted average cost of capital and return on assets  as well as the risks inherent in the development process  including the likelihood of achieving technological success and market acceptance 
each project was analyzed to determine the unique technological innovations  the existence and reliance on core technology  the existence of any alternative future use or current technological feasibility  and the complexity  cost and time to complete the remaining development 
future cash flows for each project were estimated based on forecasted revenue and costs  taking into account product life cycles  and market penetration and growth rates 
as of march   all ipr d projects were complete 
interest and other income  net components of our interest and other income  net  are as follows in millions interest income gain on sales of marketable securities loss on sales of marketable securities impairment of marketable securities other interest and other income for fiscal of million was comprised principally of interest income of million related to our portfolio of marketable securities and million of net realized gains on sales of marketable securities  partially offset by a million impairment charge on marketable securities 
interest income decreased primarily due to a decrease in the balance of our marketable securities and a decline in interest rates 

table of contents interest and other income for fiscal of million was comprised principally of interest income of million related to our portfolio of marketable securities  partially offset by an million impairment charge on marketable securities and million of net realized losses on sales of marketable securities 
we reviewed various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge related to our unrealized losses in marketable securities  including the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the marketable security  the magnitude of the unrealized loss compared to the cost of the investment  the length of time the investment has been in a loss position and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of market value 
based on this analysis  we determined that a portion of the unrealized losses were other than temporary and recorded impairment charges 
the impairment of marketable securities in fiscal and included million and million  respectively  related to shares of common stock in a publicly traded company which were received in connection with the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business 
income taxes our effective income tax rate for continuing operations was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in fiscal  our effective tax rate continued to benefit from higher income generated by foreign operations  which is taxed at more favorable rates 
the annual rate for fiscal reflected tax benefits associated with the resolution of routine tax examinations and the reversal of tax reserves resulting from the expiration of certain statutes of limitations 
as of april   we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
discontinued operations in november  we completed the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business 
in connection with this transaction  we recognized a gain on sale before income taxes of million 
income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  consists of direct revenues and direct expenses of the discontinued business  including cost of revenues  as well as other fixed and allocated costs to the extent that such costs were eliminated as a result of the transaction 
general corporate overhead costs have not been allocated to discontinued operations 
a summary of the operating results of the discontinued business included in discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income is as follows in millions net revenues income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes gain on sale of discontinued operations  net of income taxes liquidity and capital resources our combined balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased to million at march   compared to million at april  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities was due primarily to the purchase of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase programs  partially offset by cash generated from operations 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and expected cash flow from operations will provide sufficient funds to finance our operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need to supplement our existing sources of 
table of contents liquidity to finance our activities beyond the next twelve months or for the future acquisition of businesses  products or technologies 
in addition  our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including changes in the markets we address  our revenues and the related manufacturing and operating costs  product development efforts and requirements for production capacity 
in order to fund any additional capital requirements  we may seek to obtain debt financing or issue additional shares of our common stock 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing  if necessary  will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
cash provided by continuing operating activities was million for fiscal and million for fiscal operating cash flow for fiscal reflects our net income of million  net non cash charges of million and a net decrease in the non cash components of working capital of million 
the decrease in the non cash components of working capital was primarily due to a million increase in accrued taxes  an million decrease in inventories  a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in deferred revenue  partially offset by an million increase in accounts receivable 
the increases in accrued taxes and accounts payable were primarily due to the timing of payment obligations and the increases in accounts receivable and deferred revenue were associated with the expansion of our business 
the decrease in inventories was primarily due to our ongoing efforts to improve inventory management and reduce inventory levels 
cash provided by continuing investing activities was million for fiscal and consisted primarily of net sales and maturities of marketable securities of million  partially offset by additions to property and equipment of million 
cash used in continuing investing activities was million for fiscal and consisted of net cash outflows of million for the acquisition of pathscale and million for the acquisition of silverstorm  including amounts placed in escrow related to acquisitions of million  and additions to property and equipment of million  partially offset by net sales and maturities of marketable securities of million and the receipt of million from an escrow account related to the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business 
as our business grows  we expect capital expenditures to increase in the future as we continue to invest in machinery and equipment  more costly engineering and production tools for new technologies  and enhancements to our corporate information technology infrastructure 
cash used in continuing financing activities of million for fiscal resulted from our purchase of million of common stock under our stock repurchase programs  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans and a related million tax benefit 
cash used in continuing financing activities of million for fiscal resulted primarily from our purchase of million of common stock under our stock repurchase program and the repayment of a million line of credit assumed in the silverstorm acquisition  partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans and a related million tax benefit 
our marketable securities include million of investments in auction rate securities  all of which are rated aa or higher 
during late fiscal  the market auctions of many auction rate securities began to fail  including auctions for our auction rate securities 
the underlying assets for auction rate debt securities in our portfolio are student loans  substantially all of which are backed by the federal government under the federal family education loan program 
however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize the recorded value of these investments 
the underlying assets of our auction rate preferred securities are the respective funds investment portfolio  which each had an asset coverage in excess of for the related preferred security holders as of march  we believe that the gross unrealized losses associated with the auction rate securities in our portfolio are primarily due to the current liquidity issues in the auction rate securities market 
accordingly  we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auction rate securities should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities 
based on our existing cash  cash equivalents and other marketable securities  as well as our expected cash flows from operating activities  we do not anticipate that the potential lack of liquidity of these investments in the near term will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
since fiscal  we have had stock repurchase programs that authorized us to purchase up to an aggregate of billion of our outstanding common stock  including a program approved in april authorizing the repurchase of million of our outstanding common stock and a program approved in november authorizing the repurchase of an additional million of our outstanding common stock 
as of march  
table of contents  we had repurchased a total of million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase programs for an aggregate purchase price of billion 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares for an aggregate purchase price of million  of which million was pending settlement as of march  during fiscal  we purchased million shares for an aggregate purchase price of million  of which million was pending settlement as of april  we have certain contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments in the form of non cancelable purchase orders to our suppliers and commitments under operating lease arrangements 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of march   and their impact on our cash flows in future fiscal years  is as follows thereafter total in millions operating leases non cancelable purchase obligations total we adopted fin during the first quarter of fiscal and the amount of unrecognized tax benefits at march  was million 
the company has not provided a detailed estimate of the timing due to the uncertainty of when the related tax settlements are due 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the accounting policies described below to be our most critical accounting policies 
these accounting policies are affected significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order or a signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery occurs when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement with the customer 
the customer s obligation to pay and the payment terms are set at the time of delivery and are not dependent on the subsequent resale of our product 
however  certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements which contain a limited right to return unsold product and price protection provisions 
we recognize revenue from these distributors based on the sell through method using inventory information provided by the distributor 
at times  we provide standard incentive programs to our customers and account for such programs in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
accordingly  we account for our competitive pricing incentives  which generally reflect front end price adjustments  as a reduction of revenue at the time of sale  and rebates as a reduction of revenue in the period the related revenue is recorded based on the specific program criteria and historical experience 
in addition  we record provisions against revenue and cost of revenue for estimated product returns in the same period that revenue is recognized 
these provisions are based on historical experience as well as specifically identified product returns 
royalty and service revenue is recognized when earned and receipt is reasonably assured 

table of contents for those sales that include multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue based on the relative fair values of the individual components as determined in accordance with eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
when more than one element  such as hardware and services  are contained in a single arrangement  we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element s relative fair value  provided that each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in the absence of fair value for a delivered element  we allocate revenue first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and allocate the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
in the absence of fair value for an undelivered element  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in a deferral of revenue recognition for the delivered elements 
such deferred revenue is recognized over the service period or when all elements have been delivered 
we sell certain software products and related post contract customer support pcs  and account for these transactions in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenue from software products when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is probable 
revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the element 
vsoe of the fair value is based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when the basic revenue recognition criteria are met for each element 
if we are unable to determine vsoe of fair value for an undelivered element  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the service period or when all elements have been delivered 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this reserve is determined by analyzing specific customer accounts and applying historical loss rates to the aging of remaining accounts receivable balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to pay their accounts when due  additional reserves might be required 
stock based compensation we account for stock based awards in accordance with sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and non employee directors including stock options  restricted stock units and stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan the espp based on estimated fair values on the date of grant 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we recognize stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period for stock options and restricted stock units  and the offering period for the espp 
the determination of fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
in estimating expected stock price volatility  we use a combination of both historical volatility  calculated based on the daily closing prices of our common stock over a period equal to the expected term of the option  and implied volatility  utilizing market data of actively traded options on our common stock 
we believe that the historical volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected term of the option is a strong indicator of the expected future volatility 
we also believe that implied volatility takes into consideration market expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility 
accordingly  we believe a combination of both historical and implied volatility provides the best estimate of the future volatility of the market price of our common stock 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions and are fully transferable 
however  our employee stock options have certain characteristics that are significantly 
table of contents different from traded options 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of their fair value 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
as of april   we adopted fin  which prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
under fin  income tax positions should be recognized in the first reporting period that the tax position meets the recognition threshold 
previously recognized income tax positions that fail to meet the recognition threshold in a subsequent period should be derecognized in that period 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to complex tax laws and regulations in various jurisdictions 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional liabilities or potentially to reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
differences between actual results and our assumptions  or changes in our assumptions in future periods  are recorded in the period they become known 
we recognize potential accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
deferred income taxes are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences using enacted statutory tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
temporary differences include the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent management believes that recovery is more likely than not  we do not establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
an adjustment to income would occur if we determine that we are able to realize a different amount of our deferred tax assets than currently expected 
marketable securities and investments we invest primarily in marketable debt securities 
we also hold shares of common stock in a publicly traded company  which were received in connection with the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business in november all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded at fair value  primarily based on quoted market prices 
due to the recent failures in the auction rate securities market  quoted market prices were not available for these assets as of march  accordingly  such securities were valued based on an income approach using an estimate of future cash flows 
our available for sale marketable securities are classified in our consolidated balance sheets based on the nature of the security and the availability for use in current operations 
unrealized gains and losses  net of related income taxes  are excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income until realized 
we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of an investment below its cost basis is judged to be other than temporary 
various factors are considered in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge  including the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer of the security  the magnitude of the loss compared to the cost of the investment  the length of time the investment has been in a loss position and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery of market value 
realized gains or losses and other than temporary declines in the fair value of marketable securities are determined on a specific identification basis and reported in interest and other income  net  as incurred 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we write down the carrying value of our inventory to estimated net realizable value for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
these assumptions are based on economic conditions and trends both current and projected  anticipated customer demand and acceptance of our current products  expected future products and other assumptions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
once we write down the carrying value of inventory  a new cost basis is established 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in an increase in the newly established cost basis 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to intangible assets acquired  other than goodwill  impact the amount and timing of future amortization  and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill not be amortized but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired  by comparing the carrying value to the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned 
a two step test is used to identify the potential impairment and to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
the first step is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is considered not impaired  otherwise  goodwill is impaired and the loss is measured by performing step two 
under step two  the impairment loss is measured by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of goodwill 
we perform the annual test for impairment as of the first day of our fiscal fourth quarter and utilize the two step process 
the initial recording and subsequent evaluation for impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets requires the use of significant management judgment regarding the forecasts of future operating results 
it is possible that our business plans may change and our estimates used may prove to be inaccurate 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than original estimates used  we could incur impairment charges 
long lived assets long lived assets  including property and equipment and purchased intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by the comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
estimating future net cash flows and determining proper asset groupings for the purpose of this impairment test requires the use of significant management judgment 
if our actual results  or estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than our current estimates  we could incur impairment charges 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

sfas no 
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  in february 
table of contents  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november  we have not determined the impact sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
expands the use of fair value accounting but does not affect existing standards which require assets or liabilities to be carried at fair value 
under sfas no 
 a company may elect to use fair value to measure certain financial assets and liabilities 
the fair value election is irrevocable and generally made on an instrument by instrument basis  even if a company has similar instruments that it elects not to measure based on fair value 
at the adoption date  unrealized gains and losses on existing items for which fair value has been elected are reported as a cumulative adjustment to beginning retained earnings 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
sfas no

 business combinations 
sfas no 
r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions 
sfas no 
r also requires acquisition related costs and restructuring costs that the acquirer expected  but was not obligated to incur at the acquisition date  to be recognized separately from the business combination 
in addition  sfas no 
r amends sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to require the acquirer to recognize changes in the amount of its deferred tax benefits that are recognizable because of a business combination either in income from continuing operations in the period of the combination or directly in contributed capital 
sfas no 
r applies prospectively to business combinations in fiscal years beginning on or after december  and would therefore apply to us beginning in fiscal item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of march   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 
we maintain a portfolio of marketable securities consisting primarily of marketable debt securities  including government securities  corporate bonds  municipal bonds  asset and mortgage backed securities  and other debt securities  which principally have remaining terms of three years or less 
we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates as movements in interest rates can result in changes in the market value of our investments in debt securities 
however  due to the short term nature of our investment portfolio we do not believe that we are subject to material interest rate risk 
in accordance with our investment guidelines  we only invest in instruments with high credit quality standards and we limit our exposure to any one issuer or type of investment 
we also hold shares of common stock of marvell that were received in connection with the sale of our hard disk drive controller and tape drive controller business 
the shares of marvell common stock are equity securities and  as such  inherently have higher risk than the marketable securities in which we usually invest 
in addition  our portfolio of marketable securities includes million of investments in auction rate securities  all of which are rated aa or higher 
there is currently significant turmoil in the credit market  including the impact to the value and liquidity of auction rate securities 
as of march   our investment portfolio includes million of auction rate debt securities and million of auction rate preferred securities 
during late fiscal  the market auctions of many auction rate securities began to fail  including auctions for our auction rate securities 
the underlying assets for auction rate debt securities in our portfolio are student loans  substantially all of which are backed by the federal government under the federal family education loan program 
however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize the recorded value of these investments 
the underlying assets of our auction rate preferred securities are the respective funds investment portfolio  which each had an asset coverage in 
table of contents excess of for the related preferred security holders as of march  we believe that the gross unrealized losses associated with the auction rate securities in our portfolio are primarily due to the current liquidity issues in the auction rate securities market 
accordingly  we may be unable to liquidate some or all of our auction rate securities should we need or desire to access the funds invested in those securities 
based on our existing cash  cash equivalents and other marketable securities  as well as our expected cash flows from operating activities  we do not anticipate that the potential lack of liquidity of these investments in the near term will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
our asset and mortgage backed securities totaled million as of march  and consisted primarily of high quality investments insured by the federal government under freddie mac and fannie mae programs 
all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale 
as of march   we had gross unrealized losses of million that were determined by management to be temporary in nature 
if the credit market continues to deteriorate  we may conclude that the decline in value is other than temporary and incur realized losses  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments
