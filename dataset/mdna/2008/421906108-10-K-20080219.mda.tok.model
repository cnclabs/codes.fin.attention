cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements this report and documents incorporated by reference into this report contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of the exchange act  as amended  are not historical facts but rather based on current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and industry  our beliefs and assumptions 
words such as believes  anticipates  plans  expects  will  goal  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
the inclusion of forward looking statements should not be regarded as a representation by us that any of our plans will be achieved 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
such forward looking information is also subject to various risks and uncertainties 
such risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  risks arising from our providing services exclusively to the health care industry  primarily providers of long term care  credit and collection risks associated with this industry  one client accounting for approximately of revenues in see notes and  major client in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  risks associated with our acquisition of summit services group  inc  our claims experience related to workers compensation and general liability insurance  the effects of changes in  or interpretations of laws and regulations governing the industry  including state and local regulations pertaining to the taxability of our services  and the risk factors described in part i in this report under government regulation of clients  competition  service agreements collections  and under item ia risk factors 
many of our clients revenues are highly contingent on medicare and medicaid reimbursement funding rates  which congress has affected through the enactment of a number of major laws during the past decade 
these laws have significantly altered  or threatened to alter  overall government reimbursement funding rates and mechanisms 
the overall effect of these laws and trends in the long term care industry have affected and could adversely affect the liquidity of our clients  resulting in their inability to make payments to us on agreed upon payment terms 
these factors  in addition to delays in payments from 
table of contents clients  have resulted in  and could continue to result in  significant additional bad debts in the near future 
additionally  our operating results would be adversely affected if unexpected increases in the costs of labor and labor related costs  materials  supplies and equipment used in performing services could not be passed on to our clients 
in addition  we believe that to improve our financial performance we must continue to obtain service agreements with new clients  provide new services to existing clients  achieve modest price increases on current service agreements with existing clients and maintain internal cost reduction strategies at our various operational levels 
furthermore  we believe that our ability to sustain the internal development of managerial personnel is an important factor impacting future operating results and successfully executing projected growth strategies 
results of operations the following discussion is intended to provide the reader with information that will be helpful in understanding our financial statements including the changes in certain key items in comparing financial statements period to period 
we also intend to provide the primary factors that accounted for those changes  as well as a summary of how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements 
in addition  we are providing information about the financial results of our two operating segments to further assist in understanding how these segments and their results affect our consolidated results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements as of december  and the year then ended and the notes accompanying those financial statements contained herein under item as disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the september  summit acquisition was effective as of august  as of january   summit s operations were fully integrated into healthcare services group  inc the summit results of operations  for the period september  to december  are included in our consolidated results of operations and financial information presented below 
such impact  when material and quantifiable  is discussed where we believe it would contribute to the reader s understanding of our financial statements 
as disclosed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  a cumulative effect of adjusting our deferred compensation liability resulted from applying the provisions of securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 

we have adopted sab no 
at december  and for the year then ended 
historically  the appreciation on our common stock held in our deferred compensation plan the plan trust account was not recognized in the reporting of the deferred compensation liability 
in accordance with the guidance provided by emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf no 
 we increased our recorded deferred compensation liability to reflect the current fair market value of our shares held in the plan trust account 
prior to the adoption of sab no 
 we used the rollover method described therein in evaluating the materiality of financial statements adjustments 
we determined the impact from the adjustment to be immaterial to the year ended december  and prior periods financial results under the rollover method 
additionally  we have evaluated the adjustment using the dual approach method described in sab no 
pursuant to the guidance of sab no 
 the adjustment to the liability was accomplished by the recording in of the cumulative effect  as of january   a   net of income taxes increase to correct the liability balance as of december  offsetting this increase to our liability was a corresponding charge to retained earnings beginning balance 
additionally  the financial statements were effected by the adjustment through an approximately   net of income taxes increase to the liability with a corresponding charge to deferred compensation expense to reflect the changes in fair market value during of this adjustment  approximately   net of income taxes was applicable to previously reported periods through september  and   after income taxes impacted our fourth quarter results 
reported results for periods prior to january  have not been adjusted 
overview we provide housekeeping  laundry  linen  facility maintenance and food services to the health care industry  including nursing homes  retirement complexes  rehabilitation centers and hospitals located throughout the 
table of contents united states 
we believe that we are the largest provider of housekeeping and laundry services to the long term care industry in the united states  rendering such services to approximately  facilities in states as of december  although we do not directly participate in any government reimbursement programs  our clients reimbursements are subject to government regulation 
therefore  they are directly affected by any legislation relating to medicare and medicaid reimbursement programs 
we provide our services primarily pursuant to full service agreements with our clients 
in such agreements  we are responsible for the management and hourly employees located at our clients facilities 
we also provide services on the basis of a management only agreement for a very limited number of clients 
our agreements with clients typically provide for a one year service term  cancelable by either party upon to days notice after the initial day period 
we are organized into two reportable segments  housekeeping  laundry  linen and other services housekeeping  and food services food 
the services provided by housekeeping consist primarily of the cleaning  disinfecting and sanitizing of patient rooms and common areas of a client s facility  as well as the laundering and processing of the personal clothing belonging to the facility s patients 
also within the scope of this segment s service is the laundering and processing of the bed linens  uniforms and other assorted linen items utilized by a client facility 
food consists of providing for the development of a menu that meets the patient s dietary needs  and the purchasing and preparing of the food for delivery to the patients 
in addition to summit whose operations were fully integrated into healthcare s on january   we operate two wholly owned subsidiaries  hcsg supply  inc supply and huntingdon holdings  inc huntingdon 
supply purchases  warehouses and distributes the supplies and equipment used in providing our housekeeping segment services

housekeeping is our largest and core reportable segment  representing approximately of consolidated revenues 
food revenues represented approximately of consolidated revenues 
additionally  other ancillary services accounted for of consolidated revenues 

table of contents although there can be no assurance thereof  we believe that in each of housekeeping s and food s revenues  as a percentage of consolidated revenues  will remain approximately the same as their respective percentages noted above 
furthermore  we expect the sources of growth in for the respective operating segments will be primarily the same as historically experienced 
accordingly  although there can be no assurance thereof  the growth in food is expected to come from our current housekeeping client base  while growth in housekeeping will primarily come from obtaining new clients

at both december  and amounts due from such client represented less than of our accounts receivable balance 
this client completed its previously announced merger on march  our relationship with this successor entity remains under the same terms and conditions as established prior to the merger 
although we expect to continue the relationship with this client  there can be no assurance thereof  and the loss of such client  or a significant reduction in the revenues we receive from this client  would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of our two operating segments 
in addition  if such client changes its payment terms it would increase our accounts receivable balance and have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents

food s income before income taxes decreased on a reportable segment basis which is primarily attributable to a decline in the gross profit earned at certain clients facility level operations  as well as additional costs incurred in the initiative of repositioning the direct management of food to the respective geographical housekeeping divisional management teams 
these factors were partially offset by the gross profit earned on the increase in reportable segment revenues 
consolidated income taxes our effective tax rate increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in the effective tax rate is primarily a result of an increase in pre tax book income  decreasing the favorable impact of tax exempt income  and the impact of state income taxes

we consider the three policies discussed below to be critical to an understanding of our financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on our judgment 
therefore  it should be noted that financial reporting results rely on estimating the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies and estimates are described in the following paragraphs 
for these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
any such adjustments or revisions to estimates could result in material differences to previously reported amounts 
the three policies discussed are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting standards generally accepted in the united states  with no need for our judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which our judgment in selecting another available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which are included in this annual report on form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance is established as losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for bad debts charged to earnings 
the allowance is evaluated based on our 
table of contents periodic review of accounts and notes receivable and is inherently subjective as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision as more information becomes available 
we have had varying collection experience with respect to our accounts and notes receivable 
when contractual terms are not met  we generally encounter difficulty in collecting amounts due from certain of our clients 
therefore  we have sometimes been required to extend the period of payment for certain clients beyond contractual terms 
these clients include those who have terminated service agreements and slow payers experiencing financial difficulties 
in making credit evaluations  in addition to analyzing and anticipating  where possible  the specific cases described above  we consider the general collection risks associated with trends in the long term care industry 
we also establish credit limits  perform ongoing credit evaluations  and monitor accounts to minimize the risk of loss 
in accordance with the risk of extending credit  we regularly evaluate our accounts and notes receivable for impairment or loss of value and when appropriate  will provide in our allowance for such receivables 
we generally follow a policy of reserving for receivables due from clients in bankruptcy  clients with which we are in litigation for collection and other slow paying clients 
the reserve is based upon our estimates of ultimate collectibility 
correspondingly  once our recovery of a receivable is determined through either litigation  bankruptcy proceedings or negotiation to be less than the recorded amount on our balance sheet  we will charge off the applicable amount to the allowance 
our methodology for the allowance is based upon a risk based evaluation of accounts and notes receivable associated with a client s ability to make payments 
such allowance generally consists of an initial amount established based upon criteria generally applied if and when a client account files bankruptcy  is placed for collection litigation and or is considered to be pending collection litigation 
the initial allowance is adjusted either higher or lower when additional information is available to permit a more accurate estimate of the collectibility of an account 
summarized below for the years through are the aggregate account balances for the three allowance criteria noted above  net write offs of client accounts  bad debt provision and allowance for doubtful accounts 
aggregate account balances of clients in bankruptcy or in or pending net write offs bad debt allowance for year ending collection litigation of client accounts provision doubtful accounts at december   we identified accounts totaling  that require an allowance based on potential impairment or loss of value 
an allowance totaling  was provided for these accounts at such date 
actual collections of these accounts could differ from that which we currently estimate 
if our actual collection experience is less than our estimate  the related increase to our allowance would decrease net income by approximately  notwithstanding our efforts to minimize credit risk exposure  our clients could be adversely affected if future industry trends  as more fully discussed under liquidity and capital resources below  and as further described in this annual report on form k in part i under risk factors  government regulation of clients and service agreements collections  change in such a manner as to negatively impact the cash flows of our clients 
if our clients experience a negative impact in their cash flows  it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents accrued insurance claims we currently have a paid loss retrospective insurance plan for general liability and workers compensation insurance  which comprise approximately of our liabilities at december  our accounting for this plan is affected by various uncertainties because we must make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
we address these uncertainties by regularly evaluating our claims pay out experience  present value factor and other factors related to the nature of specific claims in arriving at the basis for our accrued insurance claims estimate 
our evaluations are based primarily on current information derived from reviewing our claims experience and industry trends 
in the event that our claims experience and or industry trends result in an unfavorable change  it would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
under these plans  predetermined loss limits are arranged with an insurance company to limit both our per occurrence cash outlay and annual insurance plan cost 
for workers compensation  we record a reserve based on the present value of future payments  including an estimate of claims incurred but not reported  that are developed as a result of a review of our historical data and open claims 
the present value of the payout is determined by applying an discount factor against the estimated value of the claims over the estimated remaining pay out period 
reducing the discount factor by would reduce net income by approximately  additionally  reducing the estimated payout period by six months would result in an approximate  reduction in net income 
for general liability  we record a reserve for the estimated ultimate amounts to be paid for known claims 
the estimated ultimate reserve amount recorded is derived from the estimated claim reserves provided by our insurance carrier reduced by an historical experience factor 
asset valuations and review for potential impairment we review our fixed assets  goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
this review requires that we make assumptions regarding the value of these assets and the changes in circumstances that would affect the carrying value of these assets 
if such analysis indicates that a possible impairment may exist  we are then required to estimate the fair value of the asset and  as deemed appropriate  expense all or a portion of the asset 
the determination of fair value includes numerous uncertainties  such as the impact of competition on future value 
we believe that we have made reasonable estimates and judgments in determining whether our long term assets have been impaired  however  if there is a material change in the assumptions used in our determination of fair value or if there is a material change in economic conditions or circumstances influencing fair value  we could be required to recognize certain impairment charges in the future 
as a result of our most recent reviews  no changes in asset values were required 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  compared to december  cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  we view our cash and cash equivalents as our principal measure of liquidity 
our current ratio at december  increased to to compared to to at december  this increase resulted primarily from higher cash balances and the increase in accounts and notes receivable resulting primarily from our increase in revenues  as well as the increase in inventories resulting primarily from the increase in the number of client facilities we service 
on an historical basis  our operations have generally produced consistent cash flow and have required limited capital resources 
we believe our current and near term cash flow positions will enable us to fund our continued anticipated growth 
operating activities the net cash provided by our operating activities was  for the year ended december  the principal sources of net cash flows from operating activities for were net income  including non cash charges to operations for bad debt provisions  and depreciation and amortization 
additionally  operating activities cash flows increased by  as a result of the timing of payments for accrued payroll  
table of contents accrued and withheld payroll taxes 
the operating activity that used the largest amount of cash during the year ended december  was a net increase of  in accounts and notes receivable and long term notes receivable resulting primarily from the growth in the company s revenues 
additionally  cash flows from operating activity were reduced by a  increase in inventories and supplies  and a  decrease in accounts payable and other accrued expenses resulting from the timing of such payments 
investing activities our principal use of cash in investing activities for the year ended december  was  for the purchases of housekeeping equipment  computer software and equipment  and laundry equipment installations 
see capital expenditures below 
financing activities we have paid regular quarterly cash dividends since the second quarter of during  we paid to shareholders regular quarterly cash dividends totaling  as follows 
st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter cash dividend per common share total cash dividends paid record date february april july october payment date february may august november additionally  on january   our board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of 
per common share which was paid on february  to shareholders of record as of the close of business february  our board of directors reviews our dividend policy on a quarterly basis 
although there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or the amount of the dividend  we expect to continue to pay a regular quarterly cash dividend 
in connection with the establishment of our dividend policy  we adopted a dividend reinvestment plan in during the year ended december   we received proceeds of  from the exercise of stock options by employees and directors 
additionally  as a result of deductions derived from the stock option exercises  we recognized an income tax benefit of line of credit we have a  bank line of credit on which we may draw to meet short term liquidity requirements in excess of internally generated cash flow 
amounts drawn under the line of credit are payable upon demand 
at december   there were no borrowings under the line of credit 
however  at such date  we had outstanding a  irrevocable standby letter of credit which relates to payment obligations under our insurance programs 
as a result of the letter of credit issued  the amount available under the line of credit was reduced by  at december  the line of credit requires us to satisfy two financial covenants 
such covenants  and their respective status at december  were as follows covenant description and requirement status at december  commitment coverage ratio cash and cash equivalents must equal or exceed outstanding obligations under the line of credit by a multiple of commitment coverage is tangible net worth must exceed  tangible net worth is  as noted above  we complied with both financial covenants at december  and expect to continue to remain in compliance with all such financial covenants 
this line of credit expires on june  we believe the line of credit will be renewed at that time 

table of contents accounts and notes receivable we expend considerable effort to collect the amounts due for our services on the terms agreed upon with our clients 
many of our clients participate in programs funded by federal and state governmental agencies which historically have encountered delays in making payments to its program participants 
congress has enacted a number of laws during the past decade that have significantly altered  or may alter  overall government reimbursement for nursing home services 
because our clients revenues are generally reliant on medicare and medicaid reimbursement funding rates and mechanisms  the overall effect of these laws and trends in the long term care industry have affected and could adversely affect the liquidity of our clients  resulting in their inability to make payments to us on agreed upon payment terms 
these factors  in addition to delays in payments from clients  have resulted in and could continue to result in significant additional bad debts in the near future 
whenever possible  when a client falls behind in making agreed upon payments  we convert the unpaid accounts receivable to interest bearing promissory notes 
the promissory notes receivable provide a means by which to further evidence the amounts owed and provide a definitive repayment plan and therefore may ultimately enhance our ability to collect the amounts due 
at december  and december   we had  and  net of reserves  respectively  of such promissory notes outstanding 
additionally  we consider restructuring service agreements from full service to management only service in the case of certain clients experiencing financial difficulties 
we believe that such restructurings may provide us with a means to maintain a relationship with the client while at the same time minimizing collection exposure 
we have had varying collection experience with respect to our accounts and notes receivable 
when contractual terms are not met  we generally encounter difficulty in collecting amounts due from certain of our clients 
therefore  we have sometimes been required to extend the period of payment for certain clients beyond contractual terms 
these clients include those who have terminated service agreements and slow payers experiencing financial difficulties 
in order to provide for these collection problems and the general risk associated with the granting of credit terms  we have recorded bad debt provisions in an allowance for doubtful accounts of   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
these provisions represent approximately  
and  as a percentage of total revenues for such respective periods 
in making our credit evaluations  in addition to analyzing and anticipating  where possible  the specific cases described above  we consider the general collection risk associated with trends in the long term care industry 
we also establish credit limits  perform ongoing credit evaluation and monitor accounts to minimize the risk of loss 
notwithstanding our efforts to minimize credit risk exposure  our clients could be adversely affected if future industry trends change in such a manner as to negatively impact their cash flows 
if our clients experience a negative impact in their cash flows  it would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
at december   amounts due from our major client represented less than of our accounts receivable balance 
if such client changes its payment terms  it would increase our accounts receivable balance and have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and cash and cash equivalents 
insurance programs we have a paid loss retrospective insurance plan for general liability and workers compensation insurance 
under these plans  pre determined loss limits are arranged with an insurance company to limit both our per occurrence cash outlay and annual insurance plan cost 
for workers compensation  we record a reserve based on the present value of future payments  including an estimate of claims incurred but not reported  that are developed as a result of a review of our historical data and open claims 
the present value of the payout is determined by applying an discount factor against the estimated value of the claims over the estimated remaining pay out period 
for general liability  we record a reserve for the estimated ultimate amounts to be paid for known claims 
the estimated ultimate reserve amount recorded is derived from the estimated claim reserves provided by our insurance carrier reduced by an historical experience factor 

table of contents we regularly evaluate our claims pay out experience  present value factor and other factors related to the nature of specific claims in arriving at the basis for our accrued insurance claims estimate 
our evaluation is based primarily on current information derived from reviewing our claims experience and industry trends 
in the event that our claims experience and or industry trends result in an unfavorable change  it would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
capital expenditures the level of capital expenditures is generally dependent on the number of new clients obtained 
such capital expenditures primarily consist of housekeeping equipment purchases  laundry and linen equipment installations  and computer hardware and software 
although we have no specific material commitments for capital expenditures through the end of calendar year  we estimate that for the period we will have capital expenditures of  to  in connection with housekeeping equipment purchases and laundry and linen equipment installations in our clients facilities  as well as expenditures relating to internal data processing hardware and software requirements 
we believe that our cash from operations  existing cash and cash equivalents balance and credit line will be adequate for the foreseeable future to satisfy the needs of our operations and to fund our anticipated growth 
however  should these sources not be sufficient  we would  if necessary  seek to obtain necessary working capital from such sources as long term debt or equity financing 
material off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements  other than our irrevocable standby letter of credit previously discussed 
effects of inflation although there can be no assurance thereof  we believe that in most instances we will be able to recover increases in costs attributable to inflation by passing through such cost increases to our clients 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk 
our primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates  which would impact interest income earned on investments
