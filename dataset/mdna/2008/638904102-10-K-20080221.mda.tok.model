item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes which appear elsewhere in this form k 
it contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
please see note on forward looking statements and risk factors for more information 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are an international insurance holding company focusing on specialty products for niches within the overall property casualty insurance market 
the company s underwriting segments consists of insurance company operations and operations at lloyd s of london 
our largest product line and most long standing area of specialization is ocean marine insurance 
we have also developed specialty niches in professional liability insurance and in specialty liability insurance primarily consisting of contractors liability and primary and excess liability coverages 
we conduct operations through our insurance companies and our lloyd s operations 
the insurance companies consist of navigators insurance company  which includes our u 
k 
branch  and navigators specialty insurance company  which underwrites specialty and professional liability insurance on an excess and surplus lines basis fully reinsured by navigators insurance company 
our lloyd s operations include nual  a lloyd s underwriting agency which manages syndicate we participate in the capacity of syndicate through two wholly owned lloyd s corporate members 
while management takes into consideration a wide range of factors in planning the company s business strategy and evaluating results of operations  there are certain factors that management believes are fundamental to understanding how the company is managed 
first  underwriting profit is consistently emphasized as a primary goal  above premium growth 
management s assessment of our trends and potential growth in underwriting profit is the dominant factor in its decisions with respect to whether or not to expand a business line  enter into a new niche  product or territory or  conversely  to contract capacity in any business line 
in addition  management focuses on managing the costs of our operations 
management believes that careful monitoring of the costs of existing operations and assessment of costs of potential growth opportunities are important to our profitability 
access to capital also has a significant impact on management s outlook for our operations 
the insurance companies operations and ability to grow their business and take advantage of market opportunities are particularly constrained by regulatory capital requirements and rating agency assessments of capital adequacy 
the discussions that follow include tables  which contain both our consolidated and segment operating results for each of the years in the three year period ended december  in presenting our financial results we have discussed our performance with reference to underwriting profit or loss and the related combined ratio  both of which are non gaap measures of underwriting profitability 
we consider such measures  which may be defined differently by other companies  to be important in the understanding of our overall results of operations 
underwriting profit or loss is calculated from net earned premium  less the sum of net losses and lae  commission expense  other operating expenses and commission income and other income expense 
the combined ratio is derived by dividing the sum of net losses and lae  commission expense  other operating expenses and commission income and other income expense divided by earned premium 
a combined ratio of less than indicates an underwriting profit and over indicates an underwriting loss 
although not a financial measure  management s decisions are also greatly influenced by access to specialized underwriting and claims expertise in our lines of business 
we have chosen to operate in specialty niches with certain common characteristics which we believe provide us with the opportunity to use our technical underwriting expertise in order to realize underwriting profit 
as a result  we have focused on underserved markets for businesses characterized by higher severity and low frequency of loss where we believe our intellectual capital and financial strength bring meaningful value 
in contrast  we have avoided niches that we believe have a high frequency of loss activity and or are subject to a high level of regulatory coverage requirements  such as workers compensation and personal automobile insurance  because we do not believe our technical expertise is of as much value in these types of businesses 
examples of niches that have the characteristics we look for include bluewater hull which provides coverage for physical damage to  for example  highly valued cruise ships  and directors and officers liability d o insurance which covers litigation exposure of a corporation s directors and officers 
these types of exposures require substantial technical expertise 
we attempt to mitigate the financial impact of severe claims on our results by conservative and detailed underwriting  prudent use of reinsurance and a balanced portfolio of risks 
our revenue is primarily comprised of premiums and investment income 
the insurance companies derive their premiums primarily from business written by the navigators agencies  which are wholly owned insurance underwriting agencies of the company 
the lloyd s operations derive their premiums from business written by nual 
beginning in  the navigators agencies produce and manage business almost exclusively for the insurance companies and are reimbursed for actual costs 
prior to  the navigators agencies received commissions and  in some cases  profit commissions on the business produced on behalf of the insurance companies and other unaffiliated insurers 
nual is reimbursed for its actual costs and  where applicable  profit commissions on the business produced for syndicate up until  we have experienced generally beneficial market changes in our lines of business 
as a result of several large industry losses in the second quarter of  the marine insurance market began to experience diminished capacity and rate increases  initially in the offshore energy line of business 
the marine rate increases began to level off in and into as a result of the substantial insurance industry losses resulting from 
table of contents hurricanes katrina and rita  the marine insurance market experienced diminished capacity and rate increases through the end of  particularly for the offshore energy risks located in the gulf of mexico 
since the end of  competitive market conditions have returned as available capacity has increased 
the average renewal rates for our insurance companies marine business decreased approximately for the fourth quarter and for the twelve month period  including offshore energy average renewal rates which decreased approximately for the fourth quarter and for the twelve months 
the average renewal rates for our lloyd s operations marine business decreased approximately for the fourth quarter and for the twelve month period  including offshore energy average renewal rates which decreased approximately for the fourth quarter and for the twelve months 
we expect continuing overall declines in pricing for marine lines of business  including offshore energy  as additional capacity continues to re enter the marine market 
specialty liability losses in to  particularly for our construction liability business  also resulted in diminished capacity in the market in which we compete  as many former competitors who lacked the expertise to selectively underwrite this business have been forced to withdraw from the market resulting in approximate rate increases of in and in this was followed by a slight decline in rates of approximately in the year average renewal rates for the construction liability business declined approximately  primarily due to additional competition in the marketplace 
this decline continued into with average renewal rates declining approximately for the fourth quarter and for the twelve months 
we expect competitive conditions will continue into resulting in continued declines in pricing for construction liability and excess liability business 
in the professional liability market  the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of  together with financial and accounting scandals at publicly traded corporations and the increased frequency of securities related class action litigation  has led to heightened interest in professional liability insurance generally 
average professional liability renewal premium rates decreased approximately for the fourth quarter and for the twelve months compared to relatively level rates in both the and after decreasing approximately in which followed substantial rate increases in and  particularly for d o insurance 
the d o insurance renewal premium rates decreased approximately for the fourth quarter and for the twelve months following decreases of approximately for both and and a decrease of in we anticipate continuing declines in pricing given the overall favorable industry underwriting results since for the professional liability lines of business 
our business is cyclical and influenced by many factors 
these factors include price competition  economic conditions  interest rates  weather related events and other catastrophes including natural and man made disasters for example hurricanes and terrorism  state regulations  court decisions and changes in the law 
the incidence and severity of catastrophes are inherently unpredictable 
although we will attempt to manage our exposure to such events  the frequency and severity of catastrophic events could exceed our estimates  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
additionally  because our insurance products must be priced  and premiums charged  before costs have fully developed  our liabilities are required to be estimated and recorded in recognition of future loss and settlement obligations 
due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating these liabilities  we cannot assure you that our actual liabilities will not exceed our recorded amounts 
for additional information regarding our business  see description of business general 
catastrophe risk management our insurance companies and lloyd s operations have exposure to losses caused by hurricanes and other natural and man made catastrophic events 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are unpredictable 
the extent of losses from a catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
we continually assess our concentration of underwriting exposures in catastrophe exposed areas globally and attempt to manage this exposure through individual risk selection and through the purchase of reinsurance 
we also use modeling and concentration management tools that allow us to better monitor and control our accumulations of potential losses from catastrophe exposures 
despite these efforts  there remains uncertainty about the characteristics  timing and extent of insured losses given the nature of catastrophes 
the occurrence of one or more severe catastrophic events could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
the company has significant catastrophe exposures throughout the world with the largest catastrophe exposure for offshore energy risks due to hurricanes in the gulf of mexico 
based on an assessment made at the end of taking into account the reinsurance structure  the company believes that its estimated probable maximum pre tax gross and net loss exposure in a so called or theoretical one in two hundred and fifty year hurricane event in the gulf of mexico would approximate million and million  respectively  including the cost of reinsurance reinstatement premiums 
there are a number of significant assumptions and related variables related to such an estimate including the size  force and path of the hurricane  the various types of the insured risks exposed to the event at the time the event occurs and the estimated costs or damages incurred for each insured risk 
there can be no assurances that the gross and net loss amounts that the company could incur in such an event or in any hurricanes that may occur in the gulf of mexico would not be materially higher than the estimates discussed above given the significant uncertainties with respect to such an estimate 
the occurrence of large loss events could reduce the reinsurance coverage that is available to us and could weaken the financial condition of our reinsurers  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
although the reinsurance agreements make the reinsurers liable to us to the extent the risk is transferred or ceded to the reinsurer  ceded reinsurance arrangements do not eliminate our obligation to pay claims to our 
table of contents policyholders 
accordingly  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers 
specifically  our reinsurers may not pay claims made by us on a timely basis  or they may not pay some or all of these claims 
either of these events would increase our costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are required to pay the losses even if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement 
hurricanes katrina  rita and wilma hurricanes katrina and rita the hurricanes which occurred in the third quarter generated substantial losses to the property and casualty industry and the marine and energy insurance market due principally to offshore energy losses 
hurricane wilma  which occurred in the fourth quarter  also generated substantial losses to the property and casualty industry but was not significant to either the marine and energy line of business or to the company in general  in comparison to hurricanes katrina and rita 
there were no significant hurricane losses in or that impacted the marine and energy lines of business of the company 
see description of business loss reserves included herein for a discussion of the impact of the hurricanes on our financial results 
the impact of the hurricanes on our financial results follow hurricane hurricane katrina rita total in thousands reduction in net earned premiums for reinstatement costs gross losses incurred reinsurance recoverable net losses incurred underwriting loss after tax net loss reduction in earnings per share effect on combined ratio loss and lae ratio expense ratio combined ratio hurricane katrina struck louisiana  mississippi  alabama and surrounding areas on august  and hurricane rita struck texas and louisiana and surrounding areas on september  both storms caused significant destruction in these areas including offshore energy exposures in the gulf of mexico 
our initial estimates of net losses related to each hurricane were developed from a combination of preliminary claims notifications received from brokers and insureds  portfolio modeling based upon the storm tracks of these hurricanes and the company s own internal assessment of the exposures insured under individual policies 
a substantial portion of the company s estimated loss is due to offshore energy exposures in the gulf of mexico 
since the third quarter  the company has been continually monitoring the development of paid and reported claims activities in relation to the estimate of ultimate losses established for the hurricanes 
the overall effect on losses incurred for the company from the hurricanes reviews was a benefit of million 
in addition  reinstatement costs were reduced by million which increased net written and earned premium 
see segment information included herein for discussions of the effect that the changes to the estimates related to the hurricanes had on our insurance companies and lloyd s operations 
management believes that should any adverse loss development for gross claims occur  it would be contained within our reinsurance program 
our actual losses from such hurricanes may differ materially from our estimated losses as a result of  among other things  the receipt of additional information from insureds or brokers  the attribution of losses to coverages that for the purposes of our estimates we assumed would not be exposed and inflation in repair costs due to the limited availability of labor and materials 
if our actual losses from the hurricanes are materially greater than our estimated losses  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
approximately of the gross losses incurred for the hurricanes were generated by our lloyd s operations from assumed excess of loss marine reinsurance  a substantial portion of which was retroceded 
a large portion of this assumed reinsurance was not renewed 
to the extent a hurricane similar in force and following similar paths of hurricane katrina or rita were to occur in  the company s gross losses would be substantially less than in given the reductions in coverages provided by the company in the gulf of mexico but the net loss would be somewhat higher given the reduced availability of excess of loss reinsurance protection for such exposures coupled with the increased cost of excess of loss reinstatement premiums 
critical accounting policies it is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial statements 
management considers certain of these policies to be critical to the presentation of the financial results  since they require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  
table of contents and related disclosures at the financial reporting date and throughout the reporting period 
certain of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex and  consequently  actual results may differ from these estimates  which would be reflected in future periods 
our most critical accounting policies involve the reporting of the reserves for losses and lae including losses that have occurred but were not reported to us by the financial reporting date  reinsurance recoverables  written and unearned premium  the recoverability of deferred tax assets  the impairment of invested assets  accounting for lloyd s results and the translation of foreign currencies 
reserves for losses and lae 
reserves for losses and lae represent an estimate of the expected cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of losses  based on facts and circumstances then known 
actuarial methodologies are employed to assist in establishing such estimates and include judgments relative to estimates of future claims severity and frequency  length of time to develop to ultimate  judicial theories of liability and other third party factors which are often beyond our control 
due to the inherent uncertainty associated with the reserving process  the ultimate liability may be different from the original estimate 
such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current year s results 
additional information regarding our loss reserves can be found in results of operations operating expenses net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred  description of business reserves  and note  reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses  to our consolidated audited financial statements  all of which are included herein 
reinsurance recoverables 
reinsurance recoverables are established for the portion of the loss reserves that are ceded to reinsurers 
reinsurance recoverables are determined based upon the terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts which could be subject to interpretations that differ from our own based on judicial theories of liability 
in addition  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers which can be significant considering that certain of the reserves remain outstanding for an extended period of time 
we are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
additional information regarding our reinsurance recoverables can be found in the description of business reinsurance ceded section and note  reinsurance  to our consolidated audited financial statements  both included herein 
written and unearned premium 
written premium is recorded based on the insurance policies that have been reported to us and the policies that have been written by agents but not yet reported to us 
we must estimate the amount of written premium not yet reported based on judgments relative to current and historical trends of the business being written 
such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current year s results 
an unearned premium reserve is established to reflect the unexpired portion of each policy at the financial reporting date 
additional information regarding our written and unearned premium can be found in note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  and note  reinsurance  to our consolidated audited financial statements  both included herein 
substantially all of our business is placed through agents and brokers 
since the vast majority of the company s gross written premium is primary or direct as opposed to assumed direct in  direct in and direct in the delays in reporting assumed premium generally do not have a significant effect on the company s financial statements  since we record estimates for both unreported direct and assumed premium 
we also record the ceded portion of the estimated gross written premium and related acquisition costs 
the earned gross  ceded and net premiums are calculated based on our earning methodology which is generally pro rata over the policy period 
losses are also recorded in relation to the earned premium 
the estimate for losses incurred on the estimated premium is based on an actuarial calculation consistent with the methodology used to determine incurred but not reported loss reserves for reported premiums 
a portion of the company s premium is estimated for unreported premium  mostly for the marine business written by our uk branch and lloyd s operations 
we generally do not experience any significant backlog in processing premiums 
of the billion of gross written premium recorded in  million or approximately was estimated 
the estimated premium was and of the gross written premium in and  respectively 
such premium estimates are generally based on submission data received from brokers and agents and recorded when the insurance policy or reinsurance contract is bound and written 
the estimates are regularly reviewed and updated taking into account the premium received to date versus the estimate and the age of the estimate 
to the extent that the actual premium varies from the estimates  the difference  along with the related loss reserves and underwriting expenses  is recorded in current operations 
deferred tax assets 
we apply the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes whereby deferred assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
additional information regarding our deferred tax assets can be found in note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  and note  income taxes  to our consolidated audited financial statements  both included herein 
impairment of investment securities 
impairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is other than temporary 
management regularly reviews our fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of investments 
in general  we focus our attention on those securities whose market value was less than of their cost or amortized cost  as appropriate  for six or more consecutive months 
factors considered in evaluating potential impairment include  but are not limited to  the current fair value as compared to cost or amortized cost of the security  as appropriate  the length of time the investment has been below cost or amortized cost and by how much  our intent and 
table of contents ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  specific credit issues related to the issuer and current economic conditions 
other than temporary impairment losses result in a permanent reduction of the cost basis of the underlying investment 
significant changes in the factors we consider when evaluating investments for impairment losses could result in a significant change in impairment losses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
for additional detail regarding our investment portfolio at december  and  including disclosures regarding other than temporary declines in investment value  see the description of business investments section and note  investments  to our consolidated audited financial statements  both included herein 
as mentioned above  the company considers its intent and ability to hold a security until the value recovers as part of the process of evaluating whether a security s unrealized loss represents an other than temporary decline 
the company s ability to hold such securities is supported by sufficient cash flow from its operations and from maturities within its investment portfolio in order to meet its claims payment and other disbursement obligations arising from its underwriting operations without selling such investments 
with respect to securities where the decline in value is determined to be temporary and the security s value is not written down  a subsequent decision may be made to sell that security and realize a loss 
subsequent decisions on security sales are made within the context of overall risk monitoring  changing information  market conditions and assessing value relative to other comparable securities 
management of the company s investment portfolio is outsourced to third party investment managers 
while these investment managers may  at a given point in time  believe that the preferred course of action is to hold securities with unrealized losses that are considered temporary until such losses are recovered  the dynamic nature of the portfolio management may result in a subsequent decision to sell the security and realize the loss  based upon a change in market and other factors described above 
the company believes that subsequent decisions to sell such securities are consistent with the classification of the company s portfolio as available for sale 
investment managers are required to notify management of rating agency downgrades of securities in their portfolios as well as any potential investment valuation issues at the end of each quarter 
investment managers are also required to notify management to the extent the investment manager is contemplating a transaction or transactions that may result in a realized loss above a certain threshold 
additionally  investment managers are required to notify management if they are contemplating a transaction or transactions that may result in any realized loss up until a certain period beyond the close of a quarterly accounting period 
accounting for lloyd s results 
we record our pro rata share of syndicate s assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  after making adjustments to convert lloyd s accounting to us gaap 
the most significant gaap adjustments relate to income recognition 
lloyd s syndicates determine underwriting results by year of account at the end of three years 
we record adjustments to recognize underwriting results as incurred  including the expected ultimate cost of losses incurred 
these adjustments to losses are based on actuarial analysis of syndicate accounts  including forecasts of expected ultimate losses provided by the syndicate 
at the end of the lloyd s three year period for determining underwriting results for an account year  the syndicate will close the account year by reinsuring outstanding claims on that account year with the participants for the account s next underwriting year 
the amount to close an underwriting year into the next year is referred to as the reinsurance to close ritc 
the ritc transaction  recorded in the fourth quarter  does not result in any gain or loss 
additional information regarding our accounting for lloyd s results can be found in note  organization and summary of significant accounting policies  to our consolidated audited financial statements  included herein 
translation of foreign currencies 
financial statements of subsidiaries expressed in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  foreign currency translation  issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
under sfas  functional currency assets and liabilities are translated into us dollars using period end rates of exchange and the related translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
statement of income amounts expressed in functional currencies are translated using average exchange rates 
realized gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are recorded in other income expense in the company s consolidated statements of income 
results of operations and overview the following is a discussion and analysis of our consolidated and segment results of operations for the years ended december   and all earnings per share data is presented on a per diluted share basis

net investment income increased due to the cash flow from operations 
the pre tax investment yield was in and results the results of operations reflect improved financial performance compared to excluding the hurricanes due to a combination of improved underwriting results and the growth in net investment income 
the underwriting results generally benefited from increased net premium revenues and the stable or slightly declining market conditions in the professional liability and general liability markets and improved market conditions as reflected in increased premium rates in the marine business coupled with the recording of a net redundancy of prior years loss reserves of million  or per share  which reduced the combined ratio of by loss ratio points

during october  the company enhanced its financial position and ability to take advantage of market opportunities for its insurance operations by contributing million of the million of the net proceeds from its equity offering to the statutory surplus of the insurance companies 
investment income increased as pre tax investment yields rose to in compared to in and as the result of investing the cash flow from operations and the proceeds from the october equity offering in an investment environment where interest rates were fluctuating but generally increasing as the result of tightening monetary policy 

table of contents revenues 
gross written premium increased to billion in from million in and from million in  increases of  and in  and  respectively 
the growth in gross premiums over the three year period reflects a combination of business expansion in both new and existing lines of business coupled with premium rate changes on renewal policies 
the premium rate increases or decreases as noted below for marine  specialty and professional liability are calculated primarily by comparing premium amounts on policies that have renewed 
the premiums are judgmentally adjusted for exposure factors when deemed significant and sometimes represent an aggregation of several lines of business 
the rate change calculations provide an indicated pricing trend and are not meant to be a precise analysis of the numerous factors that affect premium rates or the adequacy of such rates to cover all underwriting costs and generate an underwriting profit 
the calculation can also be affected quarter by quarter depending on the particular policies and the number of policies that renew during that period 
due to market conditions  these rate changes may or may not apply to new business which generally would be more competitively priced compared to renewal business

ceded written premium 
in the ordinary course of business  we reinsure certain insurance risks with unaffiliated insurance companies for the purpose of limiting our maximum loss exposure  protecting against catastrophic losses  and maintaining desired ratios of net premiums written to statutory surplus 
the relationship of ceded to written premium varies based upon the types of business written and whether the business is written by the insurance companies or the lloyd s operations

excluding the effect of ceded reinstatement premiums for hurricane losses for  the ratio of ceded written premium to gross written premium was 
the decline in the ratio of ceded written premium to gross written premium in compared to was due to a combination of the following factors modest reductions in the amounts of marine insurance ceded on a pro rata basis by the insurance companies 
increases in our net retentions on the professional liability pro rata reinsurance treaty which renewed april  no changes occurred for the april  renewal 
an increase in the proportion of specialty gross written premium  in which we retain a higher proportion of premium relative to our other lines  to the overall total gross written premium 
in addition  effective april   the company increased its retention from  to million for the contractors liability business which reduced the amount of premium ceded 
somewhat offsetting retaining more contractors liability premium  the company generally reinsures a large percentage of its new lines of business and increases its retention as the business matures over time 
reductions in the amount of business ceded on a pro rata basis by the lloyd s operations coupled with reductions in reinsurer participation in our syndicate stamp capacity

the reserve reductions resulted from quarterly reviews of such hurricanes exposures during  which reduced gross losses incurred by million and million on a net basis

these products  which typically have a longer settlement period compared to the mix of business the company has historically written  are becoming larger components of our overall business 
the increase in gross incurred losses on the company s and balance sheets primarily relates to incurred losses for events occurring in those years less loss payments

no assurance can be given that actual claims made and related payments will not be in excess of the amounts reserved 
during the loss settlement period  it often becomes necessary to refine and adjust the estimates of liability on a claim either upward or downward 
even after such adjustments  ultimate liability may exceed or be less than the revised estimates 
as discussed below and under the caption description of business loss reserves  there are a number of factors that could cause actual losses and loss adjustment expenses to differ materially from the amount that we have reserved for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it must take into account many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events 
as a result  informed subjective judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process 
the company s actuaries generally calculate the ibnr loss reserves for each line of business by underwriting year for major products principally using two standard actuarial methodologies which are projection or extrapolation techniques the loss ratio method and the bornheutter ferguson method 
the loss ratio method is used to calculate the ibnr for the most current underwriting year while the bornheutter ferguson method is used to calculate the ibnr for all prior underwriting years  except as otherwise described below 
such methodologies are supplemented in most instances by the loss development method and the frequency severity method which are used to analyze and better comprehend loss development patterns and trends in the data when making selections and judgments under the loss ratio method and the bornheutter ferguson method 
in utilizing these methodologies  each of which is generally applicable to both long tail and short tail lines of business and all of which are described below  to develop our ibnr loss reserves  a key objective of our actuaries is to identify aberrations and systemic changes occurring within historical experience and accurately adjust for them so that the future can be projected more reliably 
this process requires the substantial use of informed judgment and is inherently uncertain 
there are instances in which facts and circumstances require a deviation from the general process described above 
two such instances relate to the ibnr loss reserve processes for our hurricanes katrina and rita losses and our asbestos exposures  where extrapolation techniques are not applied  except in a limited way  given the unique nature of hurricane losses and limited population of marine excess policies with potential asbestos exposures 
in such circumstances  inventories of the policy limits exposed to losses coupled with reported losses are analyzed and evaluated principally by claims personnel and underwriters to establish ibnr loss reserves 
at december   the gross and net loss reserve amounts of our hurricanes katrina and rita losses were million and million  respectively  and the gross and net loss reserve amounts for our asbestos exposures were million and million  respectively 
a brief summary of each actuarial method discussed above follows loss ratio method this method is based on the assumption that ultimate losses vary proportionately with premiums 
pursuant to the loss ratio method  ibnr loss reserves are calculated by multiplying the earned premium by an expected ultimate loss ratio to estimate the ultimate losses for each underwriting year  then subtracting the reported losses  consisting of paid losses and case loss reserves  to determine the ibnr loss reserve amount 
the ultimate loss ratios applied are the company s best estimates for each underwriting year and are generally determined after evaluating a number of factors which include information derived by underwriters and actuaries in the initial pricing of the business  the ultimate loss ratios established in the prior accounting period and the related judgments applied  the ultimate loss ratios of previous underwriting years  premium rate changes  underwriting and coverage changes  changes in terms and conditions  legislative changes  exposure trends  loss development trends  claim frequency and severity trends  paid claims activity  remaining open case reserves and industry data where deemed appropriate 
such factors are also evaluated when selecting ultimate loss ratios and or loss development factors in the methods described below 
bornheutter ferguson method the bornheutter ferguson method calculates the ibnr loss reserves as the product of the earned premium  an expected ultimate loss ratio  and a loss development factor that represents the expected percentage of the ultimate losses that have been incurred but not yet reported 

table of contents the loss development factor equals one hundred percent less the expected percentage of losses that have thus far been reported  which is generally calculated as an average of the percentage of losses reported for comparable reporting periods of prior underwriting years 
the expected ultimate loss ratio is generally determined in the same manner as in the loss ratio method 
loss development method the loss development method  also known as the chainladder or the link ratio method  develops the ibnr loss reserves by multiplying the paid or reported losses by a loss development factor to estimate the ultimate losses  then subtracting the reported losses  consisting of paid losses and case loss reserves  to determine the ibnr loss reserves 
the loss development factor is the reciprocal of the expected percentage of losses that have thus far been reported  which is generally calculated as an average of the percentage of losses reported for comparable reporting periods of prior underwriting years 
frequency severity method the frequency severity method calculates the ibnr loss reserves by separately projecting claim count and average cost per claim data on either a paid or incurred basis 
it estimates the expected ultimate losses as the product of the ultimate number of claims that are expected to be reported and the expected average amount of these claims 
an annual loss reserve study is conducted by the company s actuaries for each major line of business employing the methodologies as described above with the timing of such studies varying throughout the year 
additionally  a review of the emergence of actual losses relative to expectations for each line of business  generally derived from the annual reserve study  is conducted each quarter to determine whether the assumptions used in the reserving process continue to form a reasonable basis for the projection of liabilities for each product line 
such reviews may result in maintaining or revising assumptions regarding future loss development based on various quantitative and qualitative considerations 
if actual loss activity differs from expectations  an upward or downward adjustment to loss reserves may occur 
as time passes  estimated loss reserves for an underwriting year will be based more on historical loss activity and loss development patterns rather than on assumptions based on underwriters input  pricing assumptions or industry experience 
the following discusses the method used for calculating the ibnr for each line of business and key assumptions used in applying the actuarial methods described 
marine generally  two key assumptions are used by our actuaries in setting ibnr loss reserves for major products in this line of business 
the first assumption is that our historical experience regarding paid and reported losses for each product where we have sufficient history can be relied on to predict future loss activity 
the second assumption is that our underwriters assessments as to potential loss exposures are reliable indicators of the level of our expected loss activity 
the specific loss reserves for marine are then analyzed separately by product based on such assumptions  except where noted below  with the major products including marine liability  offshore energy  cargo  protection and indemnity p i  transport and bluewater hull 
the claims emergence patterns for various marine product lines vary substantially 
our largest marine product line is marine liability  which has one of the longer loss development patterns 
marine liability protects an insured s business from liability to third parties stemming from their marine related operations  such as terminal operations  stevedoring and marina operations 
since marine liability claims generally involve a dispute as to the extent and amount of legal liability that our insured has to a third party  these claims tend to take a longer time to develop and settle 
other longer tail marine product lines include p i insurance  which provides coverage for third party liability as well as injury to crew for vessel operators  and transport insurance  which provides both property and third party liability on a primary basis to businesses such as port authorities  marine terminal operators and others engaged in the infrastructure of international transportation 
offshore energy provides physical damage coverage to offshore oil platforms along with offshore operations related to oil exploration and production 
the significant offshore energy claims are generally caused by fire or storms  and thus tend to be large  infrequent  quickly reported  but occasionally not quickly settled because the damage is often extensive but not always immediately known 
other marine product lines have considerably shorter periods in which losses develop and settle 
ocean cargo insurance  for example  provides physical damage coverage to goods in the course of transit by water  air or land 
by their nature  cargo claims tend to be reported quickly as losses typically result from an obvious peril such as fire  theft or weather 
similarly  bluewater hull insurance provides coverage against physical damage to ocean going vessels 
such claims for physical damage generally are discovered  reported and settled quickly 
the company currently has extensive experience for all of these products and thus the ibnr loss reserves for all of the marine products are determined using the key assumptions and actuarial methodologies described above 
prior to  however  as discussed below  the company did not have sufficient experience in the transport product line and instead used its hull and liability products loss development experience as a key assumption in setting the ibnr loss reserves for its transport product 
specialty the reserves for specialty are established separately by product with the major product being contractors liability insurance 
other products include commercial middle markets  personal umbrella  primary casualty and excess casualty 
our actuaries generally utilize two key assumptions in this line of business first  that our historical loss development patterns are reasonable predictors of future loss patterns and second  that our claims personnel s assessment of our claims exposures and our underwriters assessment of our expected losses are reliable indicators of our loss exposure 
however  this line of business includes a number of newer products where there is insufficient company historical experience to project loss reserves and or loss development is sparse or erratic  which makes extrapolation techniques for those products extremely difficult to apply  and in those circumstances we typically rely more on industry data and our underwriters input in setting assumptions for our ibnr loss reserves as opposed to historical loss development patterns 
in addition  as discussed in more detail below with respect to construction defect reserves  our actuaries may take other market trends or events into account in setting ibnr loss reserves 
the substantial majority of the specialty loss reserves are for the contractors liability business  which insures mostly general 
table of contents and artisan contractors 
contractor liability claims are categorized into two claim types construction defect and other general liability 
other general liability claims typically derive from workplace accidents or from negligence alleged by third parties  and take a long time to report and settle 
construction defect claims involve the discovery of damage to buildings that was caused by latent construction defects 
these claims take a very long time to report and to settle compared to other general liability claims 
since construction defect claims report much later than other contractor liability claims  they are analyzed separately in the annual loss reserve study 
the company has extensive history in the contractors liability business upon which to perform actuarial analyses and does use the key assumption noted above relating to its own historical experience as a reliable indicator of the future for this product 
however  there is inherent uncertainty in the loss reserve estimation process for this line of business given both the long tail nature of the liability claims and the continuing underwriting and coverage changes  claims handling and reserve changes  and legislative changes that have occurred over a several year period 
such factors are judgmentally taken into account in this line of business in specific periods 
the underwriting and coverage changes include the migration to a non admitted business from admitted business in  which allowed the company to exclude certain exposures previously permitted for example  exposure to construction work performed prior to the policy inception  withdrawals from certain contractor classes previously underwritten and expansion into new states beginning in claims changes include bringing the claim handling in house in and changes in case reserving practices in and a california legislative change  the effects of which are yet to be fully understood by the industry  with respect to reserves and claim frequency for construction defect repairs  became effective july  with a sunset provision effective january  the law provides for an alternative dispute resolution system that attempts to involve all parties to a claim at an early stage 
the legislation may be impacting claim severity  frequency and the length of settlement which may ultimately be different than historical loss development assumptions employed in our loss reserve process 
most recently  in setting the ibnr loss reserves for construction defect claims  the company s actuaries have begun to consider a new qualitative factor based on their evolving concern with the recent decline in home values caused by the sub prime home mortgage crisis and its possible impact on the frequency and severity of construction defect claims 
as a result  the company s actuaries acknowledge this uncertainty and anticipate claims arising from alleged construction defects contributing to housing value declines on policies written on newly constructed homes in our portfolio 
we believe our reserves remain adequate to address such potential exposure  but we can give no assurances with respect thereto 
the commercial middle markets business consists of general liability  auto liability and property exposures for a variety of commercial middle market businesses  principally hospitality  manufacturing and garages 
commencing in  our actuaries are segmenting and analyzing the components of the loss development for this business among the property  liability and auto exposures which had been previously combined 
personal umbrella coverage is purchased by individuals who seek higher limits of liability than are provided in their homeowners or personal automobile policies 
losses tend to be large and infrequent  and often result from automobile accidents 
they are reserved primarily using the company s historical loss experience 
primary casualty insurance provides primary general liability coverage principally to corporations in the construction and manufacturing sector 
excess casualty insurance is purchased by corporations which seek higher limits of liability than are provided in their primary casualty policies 
neither product line has a significant amount of loss activity reported to date 
because the company has limited historical experience in these products  the ibnr loss reserves for both of these products currently are established using the loss ratio method primarily based on our underwriters input and industry loss experience 
professional liability the professional liability policies mainly provide coverage on a claims made basis mostly for a one year period 
the reserves for professional liability are analyzed separately by product with the major products being directors and officers d o liability coverage and errors and omissions e o liability coverage for lawyers and other professionals 
the losses for d o business are generally very large and infrequent  and typically involve securities class actions 
d o claims report reasonably quickly  but may take several years to settle 
while the company has been writing d o business since  the limited claim history is generally insufficient to establish ibnr loss reserves using company data 
as a result  the company principally employs assumptions based on industry experience coupled with input from its underwriters and its claims staff s assessment of potential exposure to establish ibnr loss reserves 
another key assumption with respect to establishing ibnr loss reserves for d o business is that such industry experience is representative of our future potential loss development with respect to trends in class action activity  such as the impact of stock option backdating  ipo laddering and  most recently  the sub prime mortgage crisis 
as time passes  for a given underwriting year  additional weight is given to assumptions relating to our actual experience and claims outstanding 
the e o ibnr loss reserve process is similar to the process for d o  with the exception of a particular book of business of the uk branch written from through for the u 
k branch e o business  we assume the claims  while similar in nature to the claims in the us e o business  are larger  more frequent and have a longer loss development pattern 
the ibnr loss reserves for the uk branch e o business are determined judgmentally after reviewing recent loss activity relative to the remaining in force policy count and the loss activity for similar insureds 
other loss reserves for other include inland marine business and european property business written by the uk branch 
both businesses were started in the company has limited loss history and relies primarily on assumptions based on underwriters input and industry experience 
also included are loss reserves for aviation  property and assumed reinsurance business 
table of contents in runoff since  which are periodically monitored and evaluated by claims and actuarial personnel 
lloyd s operations reserves for the company s lloyd s operations are reviewed separately for the marine and professional liability lines by product 
the major marine products are marine liability  offshore energy  cargo  specie and marine reinsurance  and the major products for professional liability are international d o and international e o 
the marine liability  offshore energy and cargo products and related loss exposures are similar in nature to that described for marine business above 
specie insurance provides property coverage for chattel  such as jewelry  fine art and cash in transit 
claims tend to be from theft or damage  and thus are small  quick to report and quick to settle 
marine reinsurance is a diversified global book of reinsurance  the majority of which consists of excess of loss reinsurance policies for which claims activity tends to be large and infrequent with loss development somewhat longer than for such products written on a direct basis 
marine reinsurance reinsures liability  cargo  hull and offshore energy exposures that are similar in nature to the marine business described above 
the process for establishing the ibnr loss reserves for the marine and professional liability lines of the lloyd s operations  and the assumptions used as part of this process  are similar in nature to the process employed by the insurance companies 
other business for the lloyd s operations includes european property and inland marine products  each of which is a new line of business where we have limited loss history and rely primarily on assumptions based on our underwriters input and industry loss experience 
the lloyd s operations products also include property coverages for engineering and construction projects and onshore energy business  which are substantially reinsured 
losses from engineering and construction projects tend to result from loss of use due to construction delays while losses from onshore energy business are usually caused by fires or explosions 
large losses tend to be catastrophic in nature and are heavily reinsured 
ibnr loss reserves for attritional losses are established based on the syndicate s extensive loss experience 
prior year reserve redundancies deficiencies as part of our regular review of prior reserves  the company s actuaries may determine  based on their judgment  that certain assumptions made in the reserving process in prior years may need to be revised to reflect various factors  likely including the availability of additional information 
based on their reserve analyses  our actuaries may make corresponding reserve adjustments 
prior year reserve redundancies of million  million and million net of reinsurance were recorded in  and  respectively  as discussed below 
the relevant factors that may have a significant impact on the establishment and adjustment of loss and lae reserves can vary by line of business and from period to period to the extent that reserves are deficient or redundant  the amount of such deficiency or redundancy is recorded as a charge or credit to earnings in the period in which the deficiency or redundancy is identified 
following is a discussion of relevant factors impacting our loss reserves the insurance companies recorded million of net prior years savings for marine business comprised of million of savings in the transport business  million of savings in the marine liability business  million of savings in the cargo business  million of savings in each of the hull and offshore energy businesses  partially offset by million of hurricanes katrina and rita loss development and million for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables for asbestos losses 
the favorable development for the liability  cargo  hull and offshore energy coverages was primarily due to reduced claim activity for the and underwriting years 
prior to  because the company did not have sufficient experience in the transport product line  it instead used its hull and liability products loss development experience as a key assumption in setting the ibnr loss reserves for its transport product 
commencing in  our actuaries determined that the company s loss development experience for its transport product had become sufficiently credible to begin establishing transport reserves using such experience  which resulted in the prior year savings referred to above recorded for this business 
the insurance companies recorded million of net prior years savings for specialty business related to the contractors liability business for the years through the prior years savings recorded for contractors liability business was due mostly to continued favorable loss frequency and severity trends for to compared to expectations 
our actuaries believe that the favorable loss frequency trends result primarily from a number of underwriting and coverage changes since  including the migration to non admitted business from admitted business in  which allowed the company to exclude certain previously permitted exposures for example  exposure to construction work performed prior to the policy inception  and withdrawals from certain contractor classes previously underwritten 
our actuaries believe that the favorable loss severity trends result primarily from improved claim practices coupled with a california legislative change  effective in mid  which provides for an alternative dispute resolution system with respect to construction defect claims and is intended to avoid or mitigate costly litigation and claims settlements 
while our actuaries were unable to precisely quantify the impact of each of the foregoing factors  such factors were judgmentally taken into account in recording such prior years savings for contractors liability business by evaluating actual loss development compared to expected loss development coupled with a frequency and severity claims analysis conducted in the insurance companies have historically reserved for the professional liability business using ultimate loss ratios based on industry experience for this line of business given the company s limited claims history 
such industry experience is heavily influenced by the historical frequency and severity of large securities class action lawsuits 
during the insurance companies reduced the net reserves for such claims made policies compared to year end by million  mostly related to policies issued in and the reductions were made to recognize both the low level of open claim counts and the lack of claim 
table of contents severity compared to expectations at the time the reserves were initially established using industry experience 
in  the insurance companies recorded approximately million of net prior year savings from run off business  principally resulting from a review of open claims files in the aviation business that was discontinued in the lloyd s operations recorded million of net prior year savings  which included million due to a review of the hurricanes katrina and rita loss estimates  a release of approximately million following a review of open claim files for the years to  a million reduction in our underwriting year estimates for the liability book due to favorable loss trends  and the remaining million was mostly for offshore energy and liability business on business underwritten during following is a discussion of relevant factors impacting our loss reserves 
the insurance companies recorded million of net prior years savings for marine business consisting of million for business written in and mostly for favorable loss experience in cargo and marine liability business  partially offset by net prior years reserve deficiencies of million for and prior years 
the insurance companies recorded million of net prior years savings for specialty business of which million was for favorable loss trends for construction liability business written in and offset by net prior years reserve deficiencies of million principally for business written from to which was mostly for construction defect claims emergence in those years 
as discussed above  the company establishes reserves for the professional liability business using ultimate loss ratios based on industry experience 
during the insurance companies further reduced the net reserves for such claims made policies compared to year end  by million mostly related to the year 
the reductions were to recognize the low level of open claim counts and continued favorable development compared to expectations at the time the reserves were initially established 
the lloyd s operations recorded million of net prior years savings  which included million related to a loss commutation for the to years  with the balance spread across several lines of business in the to years 
following is a discussion of relevant factors impacting our loss reserves 
as discussed above  the company establishes reserves for the professional liability business using ultimate loss ratios based on industry experience 
during  the insurance companies further reduced the reserves for such claims made policies compared to year end  by approximately million mostly all related to the and underwriting years 
the reductions were to recognize the low level of claim counts and continued favorable development compared to expectations at the time the reserves were initially established 
the insurance companies recorded million of net prior years savings from business assumed from the lloyd s operations principally related to the underwriting year where loss reserves reductions were related to the reductions in premium estimates 
the insurance companies recorded million of net prior years savings for run off business principally due to favorable loss experience on aviation business discontinued in the insurance companies recorded net prior years reserve deficiencies of million for marine business principally due to an increase of approximately million for unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves offset by net favorable loss experience of million mostly related to the and prior underwriting years 
the insurance companies recorded net prior years reserve deficiencies of million for specialty business due to a limited amount of adverse development for a line of business discontinued in and construction business offset by favorable development in specialty business written in the mid west 
the lloyd s operations recorded million of net prior years savings mostly due to the favorable settlement of one large marine claim 
sensitivity analysis we do not calculate a range of loss reserve estimates 
we believe that ranges may not be a true reflection of the potential volatility between carried loss reserves and the ultimate settlement amount of losses incurred prior to the balance sheet date 
the numerous factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves include interpreting loss development activity  emerging economic and social trends  inflation  changes in the regulatory and judicial environment and changes in our operations  including changes in underwriting standards and claims handling procedures 
the company s actuaries use various assumptions in determining a best estimate of reserves for each line of business 
the importance of any specific assumption can vary by both individual product within a line of business and underwriting year 
if actual experience differs from key assumptions used in establishing reserves  there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves  particularly for long tail casualty classes of business 
as discussed above  our actuaries generally apply the loss ratio method to calculate the ibnr loss reserve for the most current underwriting year while the bornhuetter ferguson method is used to calculate the ibnr loss reserves for all prior underwriting years except in certain situations such as when limited or insufficient historical data is available 
set forth below is a sensitivity analysis that estimates the effect on the company s net loss reserve position of using alternative expected loss ratios for the underwriting years to and alternative loss development factors for the underwriting years to rather than those actually used in determining the company s best estimates at december  the analysis addresses each major line of business and underwriting year for which a material deviation to the company s overall reserve position is believed reasonably possible  and uses what the company believes is a reasonably likely range of potential deviation for each line of business 
the underwriting years prior to were not included given the maturity of such years and their 
table of contents relatively small contribution to the overall ibnr loss reserve amount at december  such underwriting years are therefore deemed to be less likely to cause a material deviation to the company s overall loss reserve position 
there can be no assurance  however  that actual reserve development will be materially consistent with either the original or the adjusted expected loss ratios or loss development factor assumptions  or with other assumptions made in the reserving process  or that a material deviation in loss reserves will not occur for underwriting years prior to for the selected alternative expected loss ratios  our actuaries observed the range of ultimate loss ratios recorded for the underwriting years to for each major line of business at december  after evaluating the range of ultimate loss ratio variances for each underwriting year  our actuaries judgmentally selected a range of reasonably likely variations from the ultimate loss ratios recorded for each line of business for each underwriting year out of the range of reasonably possible variations for each underwriting year 
the reasonably likely ranges of potential deviation in the loss ratios for each line of business for the to underwriting years expressed in loss ratio points are as follows reasonably likely loss ratio point variances decrease increase marine specialty professional liability lloyd s operations for the selected alternative loss development factors for the to underwriting years  our actuaries observed the range of historical loss development factors recorded for such underwriting years for each major line of business at december  after evaluating the range of loss development factor variances for each underwriting year  our actuaries judgmentally selected a range of reasonably likely variations to determine alternative ibnr loss reserve amounts compared to the amounts recorded for each line of business for the underwriting years to out of the range of reasonably possible variations for such underwriting years 
such variations represent the differences in the time that it takes for losses to develop for an underwriting year 
the reasonably likely ranges of potential deviations in the aggregate or overall loss development factors for all underwriting years for each line of business are as follows reasonably likely ultimate loss development factor variances decrease increase marine specialty professional liability lloyd s operations such sensitivity analysis was performed in the aggregate for all products in each line of business 
the use of aggregate data was considered more stable and reliable compared to a product by product analysis 
we cannot assure you  however  that such use of aggregate data will provide a more accurate range of the actual variations in loss development 
the sensitivity analysis uses loss ratios and loss development patterns for the to underwriting years  which are believed to be more representative compared to years prior to given the company s evolving mix of business  product changes and other factors 
there can be no assurances  however  that the use of such recent history is more predictive of actual development as compared to employing longer periods of history 
in addition  while the net loss reserves include the net loss reserves for asbestos exposures  such amounts were excluded from the sensitivity analysis given the nature of how such reserves are established by the company 
while we believe such net reserves are adequate  we cannot assure you that material loss development may not arise in the future from asbestos losses given the complex nature of such exposures 
a significant factor influencing the results of the sensitivity analysis has been the generally favorable loss trends experienced in the most recent three calendar years as evidenced by the recording of net prior year savings across each line of business 
future loss activity may in fact deviate substantially from recent experience by becoming less favorable or  in fact  unfavorable 
in such event  future loss activity could lead to smaller than reasonably likely loss reserve savings or larger than reasonably likely loss reserve deficiencies as identified below 
the sensitivity analysis also reflects a likely range of impact on reported financial results by aggregating calculated redundancy amounts and deficiency amounts for each line of business 
the total company range amounts below were determined by adding the reasonably likely range amounts for each line of business  
table of contents which are uncorrelated to each other  and therefore such amounts may not be representative of the actual aggregate favorable or unfavorable loss development amounts that may occur over time

commission expense paid to unaffiliated brokers and agents is generally based on a percentage of the gross written premium and is reduced by ceding commissions the company may receive on the ceded written premium

lloyd s and the irs have entered into an agreement whereby the amount of tax due on us connected income is calculated by lloyd s and remitted directly to the irs 
these amounts are then charged to the corporate members in proportion to their participation in the relevant syndicates 
the company s corporate members are subject to this agreement and will receive uk tax credits for any uk income tax incurred up to the uk income tax charged on the uk income 
the non us connected insurance income would generally constitute taxable income under the subpart f income section of the internal revenue code since less than of the company s premium is derived within the uk and would therefore be subject to us taxation when the lloyd s year of account closes 
taxes are accrued at a rate on our foreign source insurance income and foreign tax credits  where available  are utilized to offset us tax as permitted 
the company s effective tax rate for syndicate taxable income could substantially exceed to the extent the company is unable to offset us taxes paid under subpart f tax regulations with uk tax credits on future underwriting year distributions 
us taxes are not accrued on the earnings of the company s foreign agencies as these earnings are not subject to the subpart f tax regulations 
these earnings are subject to taxes under uk tax regulations at a rate 
a finance bill was enacted in the uk on july  that reduces the uk corporate tax rate from to effective april  the effect of such tax 
table of contents rate change was not material to the company s financial statements 
we have not provided for us deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of approximately million of our non us subsidiaries since these earnings are intended to be permanently reinvested in the foreign subsidiary 
however  in the future  if such earnings were distributed to the company  taxes of approximately million would be payable on such undistributed earnings and would be reflected in the tax provision for the year in which these earnings are no longer intended to be permanently reinvested in the foreign subsidiary assuming all foreign tax credits are realized 
the company had net state and local deferred tax assets amounting to potential future tax benefits of million and million at december  and  respectively 
included in the deferred tax assets are net operating loss carryforwards of million and million at december  and  respectively 
a valuation allowance was established for the full amount of these potential future tax benefits due to the uncertainty associated with their realization 
the company s state and local tax carryforwards at december  expire from to in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin  which became effective in  established the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authorities  and prescribes a measurement methodology for those positions meeting the recognition threshold 
the company s adoption of fin at january  did not have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
segment information the company s subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the underwriting and management of property and casualty insurance 
the company classifies its business into two underwriting segments consisting of the insurance companies and the lloyd s operations  which are separately managed  and a corporate segment 
segment data for each of the two underwriting segments include allocations of revenues and expenses of the navigators agencies and parent company s expenses and related income tax amounts previously reported separately 
we evaluate the performance of each segment based on its underwriting and net income results 
the insurance companies and the lloyd s operations results are measured by taking into account net earned premium  net losses and loss adjustment expenses  commission expense  other operating expenses and commission income and other income expense 
the corporate segment consists of the parent company s investment income  interest expense and the related tax effect 
each segment also maintains its own investments  on which it earns income and realizes capital gains or losses 
our underwriting performance is evaluated separately from the performance of our investment portfolios 
following are the financial results of the company s two underwriting segments 
insurance companies the insurance companies consist of navigators insurance company  including its uk branch  and its wholly owned subsidiary  navigators specialty insurance company 
navigators insurance company is our largest insurance subsidiary and has been active since it is primarily engaged in underwriting marine insurance and related lines of business  professional liability insurance and specialty lines of business including contractors general liability insurance  commercial and personal umbrella and excess casualty businesses

lloyd s operations the lloyd s operations consist of nual  which manages syndicate  millennium underwriting ltd

both millennium underwriting ltd

syndicate s stamp capacity was million million in  million million in and million million in the stamp capacity for and was reduced to minimize the costs associated with unused stamp capacity in coupled with anticipated declining market conditions in and following an increase in stamp capacity is a measure of the amount of premium a lloyd s syndicate is authorized to write as determined by the council of lloyd s 
we provided of syndicate s total stamp capacity in and and in  in september  the company purchased the remaining outstanding minority interest of syndicate s capacity for the underwriting year 
syndicate s stamp capacity is expressed net of commission as is standard at lloyd s 
the syndicate premium recorded in the company s financial statements is gross of commission 
lloyd s presents its results on an underwriting year basis  generally closing each underwriting year after three years 
we make estimates for each underwriting year and timely accrue the expected results 
our lloyd s operations included in the consolidated financial statements represent our participation in syndicate lloyd s syndicates report the amounts of premiums  claims  and expenses recorded in an underwriting account for a particular year to the companies or individuals that participate in the syndicates 
the syndicates generally keep accounts open for three years 
traditionally  three years have been necessary to report substantially all premiums associated with an underwriting year and to report most related claims  although claims may remain unsettled after the underwriting year is closed 
a lloyd s syndicate typically closes an underwriting year by reinsuring outstanding claims on that underwriting year with the participants for the next underwriting year 
the ceding participants pay the assuming participants an amount based on the unearned premiums and outstanding claims in the underwriting year at the date of the assumption 
our participation in syndicate is represented by and recorded as our proportionate share of the underlying assets and liabilities and results of operations of the syndicate since i we hold an undivided interest in each asset  ii we are proportionately liable for each liability and iii syndicate is not a separate legal entity 
at lloyd s  the amount to close an underwriting year into the next year is referred to as the reinsurance to close ritc transaction 
the ritc amounts represent the transfer of the assets and liabilities from the participants of a closing underwriting year to the participants of the next underwriting year 
to the extent our participation in the syndicate changes  the ritc amounts vary accordingly 
the ritc transaction  recorded in the fourth quarter  does not result in any gain or loss 
we provide letters of credit to lloyd s to support our participation in syndicate s stamp capacity as discussed below under the caption liquidity and capital resources 
whenever a member of lloyd s is unable to pay its debts to policyholders  such debts may be payable by the lloyd s central fund 
if lloyd s determines that the central fund needs to be increased  it has the power to assess premium levies on current lloyd s members up to of a member s underwriting capacity in any one year 
the company does not believe that any assessment is likely in the foreseeable future and has not provided any allowance for such an assessment 
however  based on the company s capacity at lloyd s of million  the december  exchange rate of equaled and in the event of a maximum assessment  the company would be assessed approximately million 
in addition  beginning with the underwriting year  lloyd s added a second tier of assets to the existing central fund 
this second tier was built up through a compulsory interest bearing loan to the society of lloyd s from the lloyd s members based on the stamp capacity of each syndicate for the respective underwriting year 
the funds were invested in assets eligible for society of lloyd s solvency 
the loans  of which the company had million at june   were repaid during the third quarter from a bond offering completed by lloyd s in september

we believe that we have limited exposure to credit risk since the fixed maturity investment portfolio  except for million consists of investment grade bonds 
at december   our investment portfolio had an average maturity of years and a duration of years 
management continually monitors the composition and cash flow of the investment portfolio in order to maintain the appropriate levels of liquidity to ensure our ability to satisfy claims 
impairment losses of million were recorded in no impairment losses were incurred in or as of december  and  all fixed maturity securities and equity securities held by us were classified as available for sale 
the company has a credit facility provided through a consortium of banks 
the credit facility was amended in february to increase the letters of credit available under the credit facility from million to million and to increase the line of credit available under the credit facility from million to million 
also  the expiration of the credit facility was extended from june  to march  if at that time the bank consortium does not renew the credit facility  we will need to find other sources to provide the letters of credit or other collateral in order to continue our participation in syndicate the credit facility  which is denominated in us dollars  is utilized primarily by navigators corporate underwriters ltd 
and millennium underwriting ltd 
to fund our participation in syndicate which is denominated in british sterling 
at december   letters of credit with an aggregate face amount of million were issued under the credit facility 
the line of credit was unused at december  as a result of the amendment  the cost of the letter of credit portion of the credit facility was reduced to from for the issued letters of credit and to from for the unutilized portion of the letter of credit facility 
the cost of the line of credit portion of the credit facility was also reduced to from over the company s choice of libor or prime for the utilized portion and to from for the unutilized portion 
the credit facility is collateralized by all of the common stock of navigators insurance company 
the credit agreement contains covenants common to transactions of this type  including restrictions on indebtedness and liens  limitations on dividends  stock buybacks  mergers and the sale of assets  and requirements to maintain certain consolidated tangible net worth  statutory surplus and other financial ratios 
no dividends have been declared or paid by the company through december  we were in compliance with all covenants at december  our reinsurance has been placed with various us and foreign insurance companies and with selected syndicates at lloyd s 
pursuant to the implementation of lloyd s plan of reconstruction and renewal  a portion of our recoverables are now reinsured by equitas a separate united kingdom authorized reinsurance company established to reinsure outstanding liabilities of all lloyd s members for all risks written in the or prior years of account 
time lags do occur in the normal course of business between the time gross losses are paid by the company and the time such gross losses are billed and collected from reinsurers 
during  and  approximately  and  respectively  of gross incurred losses of approximately million  million and million  respectively  were ceded to 
table of contents reinsurers 
such recoverable amounts are anticipated to be billed and collected over the next several years as gross losses are paid by the company 
generally  for pro rata or quota share reinsurers  including pool participants  the company issues quarterly settlement statements for premiums less commissions and paid loss activity  which are expected to be settled by the end of the subsequent quarter 
the company has the ability to issue cash calls requiring such reinsurers to pay losses whenever paid loss activity for a claim ceded to a particular reinsurance treaty exceeds a predetermined amount generally million as set forth in the pro rata treaty 
for the insurance companies  cash calls must generally be paid within calendar days 
there is generally no specific settlement period for the lloyd s operations cash call provisions  but such billings are usually paid within calendar days 
generally  for excess of loss reinsurers the company pays monthly or quarterly deposit premiums based on the estimated subject premiums over the contract period usually one year which are subsequently adjusted based on actual premiums determined after the expiration of the applicable reinsurance treaty 
paid losses subject to excess of loss recoveries are generally billed as they occur and are usually settled by reinsurers within calendar days for the insurance companies and business days for the lloyd s operations 
the company sometimes withholds funds from reinsurers and may apply ceded loss billings against such funds in accordance with the applicable reinsurance agreements 
at december   ceded asbestos paid and unpaid losses recoverable were million of which million was due from equitas 
the company generally experiences significant collection delays for a large portion of reinsurance recoverable amounts for asbestos losses given that certain reinsurers are in run off or otherwise no longer active in the reinsurance business 
such circumstances are considered in the company s ongoing assessment of such reinsurance recoverables 
the company believes that it has adequately managed its cash flow requirements related to reinsurance recoveries from its positive cash flows and the use of available short term funds when applicable 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to continue to adequately manage such recoveries in the future or that collection disputes or reinsurer insolvencies will not arise that could materially increase the collection time lags or result in recoverable write offs causing additional incurred losses and liquidity constraints to the company 
the payment of gross claims and related collections from reinsurers with respect to hurricanes katrina and rita could significantly impact the company s liquidity needs 
however  we expect to continue to pay the losses from the hurricanes over a period of years from cash flow and  if needed  short term investments and expect to collect our paid reinsurance recoverables generally under the terms described above 
we believe that the cash flow generated by the operating activities of our subsidiaries will provide sufficient funds for us to meet our liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
beyond the next twelve months  cash flow available to us may be influenced by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions and conditions in the insurance and reinsurance markets  as well as fluctuations from year to year in claims experience 
our capital resources consist of funds deployed or available to be deployed to support our business operations 
at december  and  our capital resources were as follows december  in thousands senior debt stockholders equity total capitalization ratio of debt to total capitalization the increases in stockholders equity in and were principally due to net income of million in and million in the company completed its public offering of senior debt on april  and received net proceeds of million of which million was contributed to the capital and surplus of navigators insurance company 
we monitor our capital adequacy to support our business on a regular basis 
the future capital requirements of our business will depend on many factors  including our ability to write new business successfully and to establish premium rates and reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
our ability to underwrite is largely dependent upon the quality of our claims paying and financial strength ratings as evaluated by independent rating agencies 
in particular  we require sufficient capital to maintain our financial strength ratings  as issued by several ratings agencies  at a level considered necessary by management to enable our insurance companies to compete  sufficient capital to enable our insurance companies to meet the capital adequacy tests performed by statutory agencies in the united states and the united kingdom and letters of credit and other forms of collateral that are necessary to support the business plan of our lloyd s operations 
as part of our capital management program  we may seek to raise additional capital or may seek to return capital to our shareholders through share repurchases  cash dividends or other methods or a combination of such methods 
any such determination will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our profits  financial requirements and other factors  including legal restrictions  rating agency requirements  credit facility limitations and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 

table of contents in october  the company s board of directors adopted a stock repurchase program for up to million of the company s common stock 
repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing prices in open market or privately negotiated transactions through december  the timing and amount of the repurchase transactions under the program will depend on a variety of factors  including the trading price of the stock  market conditions and corporate and regulatory considerations 
we have not repurchased any of our common stock during the year ended december  to the extent that our existing capital is insufficient to fund our future operating requirements or maintain such ratings  we may need to raise additional funds through financings or limit our growth 
if we are not able to obtain adequate capital  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected  which could include  among other things  the following possible outcomes potential downgrades in the financial strength ratings assigned by ratings agencies to our insurance companies which could place the company at a competitive disadvantage compared to higher rated competitors  reductions in the amount of business that our insurance companies or lloyd s operations are able to write in order to meet capital adequacy based tests enforced by statutory agencies  and any resultant ratings downgrades could  among other things  affect our ability to write business and increase the cost of the credit facility 
in addition to common share capital  we may need to depend on external sources of finance to support our underwriting activities  which can be in the form or any combination of debt securities  preference shares  common equity and bank credit facilities providing loans and or letters of credit 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are unfavorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our shareholders could result  and  in any case  such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our outstanding securities 
in july  the company filed a universal shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission 
this registration statement  which expires in july  allows for the future possible offer and sale by navigators of up to million  in the aggregate  of various types of securities  including common stock  preferred stock or debt securities 
the shelf registration statement enables us to efficiently access the public equity or debt markets in order to meet future capital needs  if necessary 
this report is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of such state 
we primarily rely upon dividends from our subsidiaries to meet our holding company obligations 
since the issuance of the senior debt in april  the holding company cash obligations primarily consist of semi annual interest payments of million 
going forward  the interest payments on the company s senior debt will be made from one or a combination of funds at the parent company  dividends from its subsidiaries and the million line of credit 
the dividends have historically been paid by navigators insurance company 
based on the december   surplus of navigators insurance company  the approximate remaining maximum amount available for the payment of dividends by navigators insurance company during without prior regulatory approval was million 
dividends of million  and million were paid by navigators insurance company during  and  respectively

economic conditions we are a specialty insurance company and periods of moderate economic recession or inflation tend not to have a significant direct effect on our underwriting operations 
they do  however  impact our investment portfolio 
a decrease in interest rates will tend to decrease our yield and have a positive effect on the fair value of our 
table of contents invested assets 
an increase in interest rates will tend to increase our yield and have a negative effect on the fair value of our invested assets 
we also consider the potential impact of economic trends in estimating loss reserves 
our management believes that the underwriting controls it maintains  and the fact that a significant amount of our business is in lines of insurance which have relatively short loss payout patterns  assist in estimating ultimate claim costs more reasonably and lessen the potential adverse impact of the economy on us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitive instruments and risk management market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
we are exposed to potential loss to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and how those exposures have been managed through december  our market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for purposes other than trading and speculation 
the carrying value of our investment portfolio as of december  was billion of which was invested in fixed maturity securities 
the primary market risk to our investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities 
we do not have any commodity risk exposure 
for fixed maturity securities  short term liquidity needs and the potential liquidity needs of the business are key factors in managing the portfolio 
the portfolio duration relative to the liabilities duration is primarily managed through investment transactions 
there were no significant changes regarding the investment portfolio in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed for the twelve months ended december  we do not currently anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
interest rate risk sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time 
in our sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure  especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by us to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
in this sensitivity analysis model  we use fair values to measure our potential loss 
the sensitivity analysis model includes fixed maturities and short term investments 
the primary market risk to our market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk 
the sensitivity analysis model uses a and basis points change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 
changes in interest rates will have an immediate effect on comprehensive income and shareholders equity but will not ordinarily have an immediate effect on net income 
as interest rates rise  the market value of our interest rate sensitive securities will decrease 
conversely  as interest rates fall  the market value of our interest rate sensitive securities will increase 
for invested assets  modified duration modeling is used to calculate changes in fair values 
durations on invested assets are adjusted for call  put and interest rate reset features 
duration on tax exempt securities is adjusted for the fact that the yield on such securities is less sensitive to changes in interest rates compared to treasury securities 
invested asset portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  including accrued investment income  using holdings as of december  the following table summarizes the effect that an immediate  parallel shift in the interest rate yield curve would have had on our portfolio at december  based on historical observations  it is unlikely that all interest rate yield curves would shift in the same direction at the same time 
interest rate shift in basis points in thousands december  total market value market value change from base change in unrealized value 
table of contents equity price risk our portfolio of equity securities  which we carry on our balance sheet at fair value  has exposure to price risk 
this risk is defined as the potential loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in stock prices 
our us equity portfolio is benchmarked to the s p index and changes in that index may approximate the impact on our portfolio 
the following table provides additional information on our exposure to equity price risk december  in thousands fair value of equity securities pre tax impact of percent decline in market prices for equity exposures foreign currency exchange rate risk our lloyd s operations maintain both assets and liabilities in certain foreign currencies 
therefore  foreign exchange rate risk is generally limited to net assets denominated in those foreign currencies 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange risk for us are the british sterling  the euro and the canadian dollar
