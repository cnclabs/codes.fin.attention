the puerto rico economy is in the midst of a prolonged economic recession since the second quarter of the unfavorable economic conditions prevailed in the fourth quarter of with continuing weakness in the labor market 
nonfarm employment declined and the unemployment rate increased percentage points to compared to the fourth quarter of meanwhile  the construction sector  which historically played an important role in the economy  remained stagnant as the government s fiscal deficit and the housing market imbalances inhibit the public and private sector from investing in new construction projects 
construction data as of november shows that the number of construction permits and cement sales declined and respectively compared to the same period in on the other hand  employment layoffs due to businesses adjustments to the current cycle reduced consumer earnings  while rising oil and food prices led to a surge in inflation that eroded their purchasing power and confidence level 
as a result  retail sales adjusted for inflation remained weak with total sales declining as of october when compared with accumulated figures for the sale of new automobile units for the fourth quarter of another important gauge of consumer spending health also remained in negative territory with sales declining by units compared with the fourth quarter of as a result of the current unfavorable economic environment in puerto rico  island finance s short term financial performance and profitability have declined significantly during  caused by reduced lending activity and increases in non performing assets and charge offs 
the corporation  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  performed an interim impairment test of the goodwill and other intangibles of island finance as of july  statement provides a two step impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the corporation completed the first step of the impairment test and determined that the carrying amount of the goodwill and other intangible assets of island finance exceeded their fair value  thereby requiring performance of the second step of the impairment test to calculate the amount of the impairment 
because the corporation was unable to complete the second step of the impairment test during the third quarter and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated  the corporation recorded preliminary estimated non cash impairment charges of approximately million and million  which were recorded as reductions to goodwill and other intangible asset  respectively  during the third quarter of the estimated impairment charges were calculated based on the market and income approach valuation methodologies 
these impairment charges did not result in cash expenditures and will not result in future cash expenditures 
the corporation completed the second step of the impairment test during the fourth quarter of accordingly  during the fourth quarter the corporation recorded an additional non cash impairment charge of million 
based upon the completed impairment test  the corporation determined that the actual non cash impairment charges as of july  were million which comprised of goodwill and million of other intangibles assets 
this impairment charge did not result in cash expenditures and will not result in future cash expenditures 
upon the completion of the interim impairment test  the corporation performed its annual impairment assessment as of october  with the assistance of the independent valuation specialist 
based upon their test  and after consideration of the july  impairment charge  the corporation determined that no additional impairment charge was necessary as of october

net interest income represents approximately of the corporation s total revenues defined as interest income plus other income for net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances 
lending activities is one of the most important aspects of the corporation s operations 
the economic environment and uncertainties in puerto rico caused reduced lending activity and impacted the quality of the corporation s loan portfolio increasing the delinquency rates and charge offs 
the net loan portfolio  including loans held for sale  increased billion  or reaching billion at december   compared to the figures reported at december  as of december   the allowance for loan losses reached million  reflecting an increase of million or  which includes million related to the bank portfolio and million related to island finance portfolio 
the ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans increased to at december  from at december  although the corporation has diversified its sources of revenue  interest income from the loan portfolio continues to account for the majority of total revenues  representing of total gross revenues for as a result  the primary influence on the corporation s operating results is the demand for loans in puerto rico  which is significantly affected by economic conditions  competition  the demand and supply of housing  the fiscal policies of the federal and puerto rico governments and interest rate levels 
changes in interest rates  the corporation s principal market risk  can significantly impact its results of operations by affecting net interest income and the gains or losses realized on the sale of loans and securities 
as described under risk management  the corporation uses derivative instruments to hedge  to a limited extent  its interest rate risk in order to protect its net interest income under different interest rate scenarios 
for the year ended december   other income reached million  a million or increase when compared to million for the same period in attributed mainly to gain on merchant business sold of million  higher fees in broker dealer and asset management and insurance fees of million  an early cancellation penalty on certain client structured certificates of deposit of million and an increase in gain on sale of loans of million offset by a decrease in credit card fees of million due to the sale of the corporation s merchant business to an unrelated third party

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of santander bancorp are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and with general practices within the financial services industry 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make judgments  involving significant estimates and assumptions  in the application of its accounting policies about matters that are inherently uncertain 
management arrives at these estimates and assumptions  which may materially affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  considering the facts and circumstances at a specific point in time 
changes in those facts and circumstances could produce actual results that differ from those estimates 
detailed below is a discussion of the corporation s critical accounting policies 
these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
for a complete discussion of the corporation s significant and critical accounting policies refer to the notes to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion throughout this document which should be read in conjunction with this section 
allowance for loan losses 
the corporation assesses the overall risks in its loan portfolio and establishes and maintains a reserve for probable losses thereon 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated loan losses based on the evaluation of known and inherent risks in the corporation s loan portfolio 
the corporation s management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a monthly basis 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is one of the most complex and critical accounting estimates the corporation s management makes 
the allowance for loan losses is composed of three different components 
an asset specific reserve based on the provisions of statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan as amended  an expected loss estimate based on the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  and an unallocated reserve based on the effect of probable economic deterioration above and beyond what is reflected in the asset specific component of the allowance 
commercial and construction loans exceeding a predetermined monetary threshold are identified for evaluation of impairment on an individual basis pursuant to sfas no 
the corporation considers a loan impaired when interest and or principal is past due days or more  or  when based on current information and events it is probable that the corporation will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the asset specific reserve on each individual loan identified as impaired is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except as a practical expedient  the corporation may measure impairment based on the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral  net of estimated disposal costs  if the loan is collateral dependent 
a reserve for expected losses is determined under the provisions of sfas no 
for all loans not evaluated individually for impairment  based on historical loss experience by loan type  management judgment of the quantitative factors historical net charge offs  statistical loss estimates  etc  as well as qualitative factors current economic conditions  portfolio composition  delinquency trends  industry concentrations  etc the corporation groups small homogeneous loans by type of loan consumer  credit card  mortgage  auto  etc 
and applies a loss factor  which is determined using an average history of actual net losses over the previous months and other statistical data 
historical loss rates are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted based on changing borrower and or collateral conditions and actual collections and charge off experience 
historical loss rates for the different portfolios may be adjusted for significant factors that in management s judgment reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss trends 
factors that management considers in the analysis include the effect of the trends in the nature and volume of loans delinquency  charge offs  non accrual  changes in the mix or type of collateral  asset quality trends  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  collection practices and examination results from internal audit and regulators 
an additional or unallocated reserve is maintained to cover the effect of probable economic deterioration above and beyond what is reflected in the asset specific and loss estimate components of the allowance 
this component represents management s view that given the complexities of the lending portfolio and the assessment process  including the inherent imprecision in the financial models used in the loss forecasting process  there are estimable losses that have been incurred but 
table of contents not yet specifically identified  and as a result not fully provided for in the components of the allowance 
the level of the unallocated reserve may change periodically after evaluating factors impacting assumptions used in the calculation of the asset specific and loss estimate components of the reserve 
the underlying assumptions  estimates and assessments used by management to determine the components of the allowance for loan losses are periodically evaluated and updated to reflect management s current view of overall economic conditions and other relevant factors impacting credit quality and inherent losses 
changes in such estimates could significantly impact the allowance and provision for loan losses 
the corporation could experience loan losses that are different from the current estimates made by management 
based on current and expected economic conditions  the expected level of net loan losses and the methodology established to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management considers that the corporation has established an adequate position in its allowance for loan losses 
refer to the allowance for loan losses section for further information 
valuation of certain financial instruments 
certain financial instruments including derivatives  hedged items  trading and investment securities available for sale  are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income or other gains and losses  as appropriate 
fair values for most of the corporation s trading and investment securities are based on listed market prices  if available 
if listed market prices are not available  fair value is determined based on other relevant factors including price quotations for similar instruments 
for securities where listed market prices are not readily available  the determination of the fair value requires management judgment as to the benchmark to be used 
significant changes in factors such as interest rates and accelerated prepayment rates could affect the fair value of the trading and investment securities 
management assesses the fair value of its portfolio at least monthly 
any impairment that is considered other than temporary is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
fair values for certain derivative contracts are derived from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments  counterparty credit risk  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
management applies judgment in determining the models used and required adjustment to such models  if any  in the valuation process 
the primary risk of material changes to the value of the derivative instruments is the fluctuation in interest rates 
however  the corporation uses derivative instruments principally as part of a designated hedging program so that a change in the value of a derivative is generally offset by a corresponding change in the value of the hedged item 
changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on the carrying amount and the related valuation gains and losses on these financial instruments 
management believes that its estimates of fair value are reasonable given the process of obtaining external prices  periodic reviews of internal models by affiliated and unaffiliated experts  and the consistent application of methodologies 
transfers of financial assets 
the corporation occasionally engages in transfers of financial assets and accounts for them in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

paragraph of sfas no 
provides that a transfer of financial assets in which the transferor surrenders control over those financial assets shall be accounted for as a sale to the extent that consideration other than beneficial interests in the transferred assets is received in exchange 
a transferor has surrendered control if all of the following conditions are met a the transferred assets have been isolated from the transferor put presumptively beyond the reach of creditors  even in bankruptcy  b each transferee has the right to pledge or exchange the assets it received and no condition constrains the transferee from taking advantage of its right to pledge or exchange  and c the transferor does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either i an agreement that both entitles and obligates the transferor to repurchase or redeem them before their maturity or ii the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specified assets  other than through a cleanup call 
in accordance with sfas no 
 a gain or loss on the sale is recognized based on the carrying amount of the financial assets involved in the transfer  allocated between the assets transferred and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
when the corporation transfers financial assets and the transfer fails any one of the sfas no 
sales criteria  the corporation is not permitted to derecognize the transferred financial assets and the transaction is accounted for as a secured borrowing 
income taxes 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  the corporation is required to estimate income taxes 
this involves an estimation of current income tax expense together with an assessment of temporary differences resulting from differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
the determination of current income tax expense involves estimates and assumptions that require the corporation to assume certain positions based on its interpretation of current tax regulations 
the corporation accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
accordingly  the corporation reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the corporation recognizes interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
changes in assumptions affecting estimates may be required in the future and estimated tax liabilities may need to be increased or decreased accordingly 
the accrual for uncertain tax positions is adjusted in light of 
table of contents changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of tax audits  case law and emerging legislation 
the corporation s effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to such accruals  including related interest and penalties  as considered appropriate by management 
when particular matters arise  a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited by the taxing authorities and finally resolved 
favorable resolution of such matters or the expiration of the statute of limitations may result in the release of uncertain tax positions  which are recognized as a reduction to the corporation s effective rate in the year of resolution 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue could increase the effective rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution 
the determination of deferred tax expense or benefit is based on changes in the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that generate temporary differences 
the carrying value of the corporation s net deferred tax assets assumes that the corporation will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change  the corporation may be required to record valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
management evaluates its deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis and assesses the need for a valuation allowance 
a valuation allowance is established when management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowance from period to period are included in the corporation s tax provision in the period of change 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income  management believes it is more likely than not  the corporation will not realize the benefits of the deferred tax assets related to santander financial services  inc amounting to million at december  accordingly  a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million was recorded at december  the corporation accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
accordingly  the corporation reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the corporation recognizes interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the corporation accounts for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the reporting units are tested at least annually to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair market value 
should this be the case  the value of goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles may be impaired and written down 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
if there is a determination that the fair value of the goodwill or other identifiable intangible asset is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income in the consolidated statement of operations 
tangible and intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
if circumstances and conditions indicate deterioration in the value of tangible assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives  the book value would be adjusted and a loss would be recognized in current operations 
the corporation uses judgment in assessing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
estimates of fair value are based on projections of revenues  operating costs and cash flows of each reporting unit considering historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
the valuations employ a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors 
generally  the corporation engages third party specialists to assist with its valuations 
additionally  judgment is used in determining the useful lives of finite lived intangible assets 
changes in judgments and projections could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in an impairment of goodwill 
as a result of the purchase price allocations from prior acquisitions and the corporation s decentralized structure  goodwill is included in multiple reporting units 
due to certain factors such as the highly competitive environment  cyclical nature of the business in some of the reporting units  general economic and market conditions as well as planned business or operational strategies  among others  the profitability of the corporation s individual reporting units may periodically suffer from downturns in these factors 
these factors may have a relatively more pronounced impact on the individual reporting units as compared to the corporation as a whole and might adversely affect the fair value of the reporting units 
if material adverse conditions occur that impact the corporation s reporting units  the corporation s reporting units  and the related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount considered recoverable 

table of contents the corporation s goodwill  resulted from business acquisitions  and consists of million that resulted from the acquisition by the bank of banco central hispano puerto rico  million that resulted from the acquisition by santander securities of merrill lynch s retail brokerage business in puerto rico and million that resulted from the acquisition of island finance 
the value of the goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue from the commercial banking segment  the wealth management segment and the consumer finance segment 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth  or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods  could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill  which would be evaluated and  if necessary be recorded as a write down in the consolidated statement of operations 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances dictate  management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount 
the evaluation for potential impairment is inherently complex  and involves significant judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions 
to determine the fair value of the reporting units being evaluated for goodwill impairment  the corporation uses the assistance of an independent consultant 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units acquired segments involves the use of estimates and assumptions including expected results of operations  an assumed discount rate and an assumed growth rate for the reporting units 
specifically  the independent consultant prepared analyses regarding the fair value of equity of the corporation s reporting units  commercial banking  wealth management and consumer finance 
the consultant may use up to three separate valuation approaches market multiple approach provides indications of value based upon comparisons of the reporting unit to market values and pricing evidence of public companies in the same or similar lines of businesses 
market ratios pricing multiples and performance fundamentals relating the public companies stock prices equity or enterprise values to certain underlying fundamental data are applied to the reporting unit to determine indications of its fair value 
comparable transaction approach includes an examination of recent transactions in which companies involved in the same or similar lines of business to the reporting unit were acquired 
acquisition values and pricing evidence are used in much the same manner as the market multiple approach for indication of the reporting unit s fair value 
discounted cash flow approach calculates the present value of the projected future cash flows to be generated by the reporting unit using appropriate discount rates 
the discount rates are intended to reflect all associated risks of realizing the projected future cash flows 
terminal values are computed as of the end of the last period for which cash flows are projected to determine an estimate of the values of the reporting unit as of that future point in time 
discounting the terminal values back to the present and adding the present values of the future cash flows yields indications of the reporting unit s fair value 
events that may indicate goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business  economic or political climate  unanticipated competition  adverse action or assessment by a regulator  plans for disposition of a segment  among others 
as a result of the current unfavorable economic environment in puerto rico  island finance s short term financial performance and profitability declined significantly during  caused by reduced lending activity and increases in non performing assets and charge offs 
the corporation  with the assistance of an independent valuation firm  performed an interim impairment test of the goodwill and other intangibles of island finance as of july  statement provides a two step impairment test 
the first step of the impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the corporation completed the first step of the impairment test and determined that the carrying amount of the goodwill and other intangible assets of sfs exceeded their fair value  thereby requiring performance of the second step of the impairment test to calculate the amount of the impairment 
because the corporation was unable to complete the second step of the impairment test during the third quarter and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated  the corporation recorded preliminary estimated non cash impairment charges of approximately million and million  which were recorded as reductions to goodwill and other intangible assets  respectively  during the third quarter of the estimated impairment charges were calculated based on the market and income approach valuation methodologies 
these impairment charges did not result in cash expenditures and will not result in future cash expenditures 
the corporation completed the second step of the impairment test during the fourth quarter of accordingly  during the fourth quarter the corporation recorded an additional non cash impairment charge of million 
based upon the completed impairment test  the corporation determined that the actual non cash impairment charges as of july 
table of contents  were million which comprised of goodwill and million of other intangibles assets 
this impairment charge did not result in cash expenditures and will not result in future cash expenditures 
upon the completion of the interim impairment test  the corporation performed its annual impairment assessment as of october  with the assistance of the independent valuation specialist 
based upon their test  and after consideration of the july  impairment charge  the corporation determined that no additional impairment charge was necessary as of october  in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  the corporation must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the corporation may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
the key assumptions used by management to determine the fair value of the reporting units include company specific risk elements that are consistent with the risks inherent in its current business models for each reporting unit 
changes in judgment and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in an impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
pension and other postemployment benefits 
the determination of the corporation s obligation and expense for pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent on the selection of certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
those assumptions are described in note to the consolidated financial statements and include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in healthcare costs 
management participates in the determination of these factors  which normally undergo evaluation against industry assumptions  among other factors 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  actual results that differ from the corporation s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and therefore  generally affect recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
the corporation uses an independent actuarial firm for the determination of the pension and post retirement benefit costs and obligations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
which requires recognition of a plan s over funded or under funded status as an asset or liability with an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income aoci 
actuarial gains or losses  prior service costs and transition assets or obligations will be subsequently recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs 
additional minimum pension liabilities ampl and related intangible assets are derecognized upon adoption of the standard 
in developing the expected return on plan assets  the corporation considers the asset allocation  historical returns on the types of assets held in the pension trust  the current economic environment  as well as input from the actuaries  financial analysts and the corporation s long term inflation assumptions and interest rate scenarios 
the expected rate of return for plan assets was set at for the years ended december   and in selecting a discount rate  the corporation considers the moody s long term aa corporate bond yield as a guide 
at december   the discount rate was for the corporation s plan and for bch s plan 
management believes that the assumptions made are appropriate  however  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect pension obligations and future expense

the impairment loss  if any  on each individual loan identified as impaired is measured based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except as a practical expedient  impairment may be measured based on the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
substantially all of the corporation s impaired loans are measured on the basis of the fair value of the collateral  net of estimated disposition costs 
the corporation maintains a detailed analysis of all loans identified as impaired with their corresponding allowances and the specific component of the allowance is computed on a quarterly basis 
additions  deletions or adjustments to the analysis are tracked and formal justification is documented detailing the rationale for such adjustments 
for small  homogeneous type of loans  a general allowance is computed based on average historical loss experience or ratios for each corresponding type of loans consumer  credit cards  residential mortgages  auto  etc the methodology of accounting for all probable losses is made in accordance with the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
in determining the general allowance  the corporation applies a loss factor for each type of loan based on the average historical net charge off for the previous twelve months for each portfolio adjusted for other statistical loss estimates  as deemed appropriate 
historical loss rates are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted based on changes in actual collections and charge off experience as well as significant factors that in management s judgment reflect the impact of any current conditions on loss recognition 
factors that management considers in the analysis of the general reserve include the effect of the trends in the nature and volume of loans delinquency  charge offs and non accrual loans  changes in the mix or type of collateral  asset quality trends  changes in the internal lending policies and credit standards  collection practices and examination results from bank regulatory agencies 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses under sfas no 
is based on historical loss experience by loan type  management judgment of the quantitative factors historical net charge offs  statistical loss estimates  etc  as well as qualitative factors current economic conditions  portfolio composition  delinquency trends  industry concentrations  etc  which result in the final determination of the provision for loan losses to maintain a level of allowance for loan losses deemed to be adequate 
the corporation s methodology for allocating the allowance among the different parts of the portfolio or different elements of the allowance is based on the historical loss percentages for each type or pool of loan consumer  commercial  construction  mortgage and other  after assigning the specific allowances for impaired loans on an individual review process 
the sum of specific allowances for impaired loans plus the general allowances for each type of loan not specifically examined constitutes the total allowance for loan losses at the end of any reporting period 
an additional or unallocated reserve is maintained to cover the effect of probable economic deterioration above and beyond what is reflected in the asset specific component of the allowance 
this component represents management s view that given the complexities of the lending portfolio and the assessment process  including the inherent imprecision in the financial models used in the loss forecasting process  there are estimable losses that have been incurred but not yet specifically identified  and as a result not fully provided for in the asset specific and general valuation components of the allowance 
the level of the unallocated reserve may change periodically after evaluating factors impacting assumptions used in the calculation of the asset specific component of the reserve 
on a quarterly basis  management reviews its determination of the allowance for loan losses which includes the specific allowance computed according to the provisions of sfas no 
and the general allowance for small  homogenous type of 
table of contents loans  which is based on historical loss percentages for each type or pool of loan 
this analysis also considers loans classified by the internal loan review department  the internal auditors  the in house watch system unit  and banking regulators 
the corporation has not changed any aspects of its overall approach in the determination of the allowance for loan losses  and there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques  as compared to prior periods 
the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses for the recently acquired island finance portfolio is the same as the methodology used in determining the allowance for the rest of the corporation s consumer portfolios

potential problem loans as a general rule  the corporation closely monitors certain loans not disclosed under non performing assets and past due loans but that represent a greater than normal credit risk 
these loans are not included under the non performing category  but management provides close supervision of their performance 
the identification process is implemented through various risk management procedures  such as periodic review of customer relationships  a risk grading system  an internal watch system and a loan review process

asset and liability management the corporation s policy with respect to asset and liability management is to maximize its net interest income  return on assets and return on equity while remaining within the established parameters of interest rate and liquidity risks provided by the board of directors and the relevant regulatory authorities 
subject to these constraints  the corporation takes mismatched interest rate positions 
the corporation s asset and liability management policies are developed and implemented by its asset and liability committee alco  which is composed of senior members of the corporation including the president  chief operating officer  chief accounting officer  treasurer and other executive officers of the corporation 
the alco reports on a monthly basis to the board of directors 
market risk and interest rate sensitivity a key component of the corporation s asset and liability policy is the management of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity is the relationship between market interest rates and net interest income due to the maturity or repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for any given period  the pricing structure is matched when an equal amount of such assets and liabilities mature or reprice in that period 
any mismatch of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is known as a gap position 
a positive gap denotes asset sensitivity  which means that an increase in interest rates would have a positive effect on net interest income  while a decrease in interest rates would have a negative effect on net interest income 
the corporation had a one year cumulative gap of billion as of december  this denotes liability sensitivity  which means that an increase in interest rates would have a negative effect on net interest income while a decrease in interest rates would have a positive effect on net interest income 
the corporation s interest rate sensitivity strategy takes into account not only rates of return and the underlying degree of risk  but also liquidity requirements  capital costs and additional demand for funds 
the corporation s maturity mismatches and positions are monitored by the alco and are managed within limits established by the board of directors 
the following table sets forth the repricing of the corporation s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  and may not be representative of interest rate gap positions at other times 
in addition  variations in interest rate sensitivity may exist within the repricing periods presented due to the differing repricing dates within the period 
in preparing the interest rate gap report  several assumptions were considered 
all assets and liabilities are reported according to their repricing characteristics 
for example  a commercial loan maturing in five years with monthly variable interest rate payments is stated in the column of up to days 
the investment portfolio is reported considering the effective duration of the securities 
expected prepayments and remaining terms are considered for the residential mortgage portfolio 
core deposits are reported in accordance with their effective duration 
effective duration of core deposits is based on price and volume elasticity to market rates 
the corporation reviews on a monthly basis the effective duration of core deposits 
assets and liabilities with embedded options are stated based on full valuation of the asset liability and the option to ascertain their effective duration

nearly all of the corporation s interest rate risk arises from instruments  positions and transactions entered into for purposes other than trading 
they include loans  investment securities  deposits  short term borrowings  senior and subordinated debt and derivative financial instruments used for asset and liability management 
as part of its interest rate risk management process  the corporation analyzes on an ongoing basis the profitability of the balance sheet structure  and how this structure will react under different market scenarios 
in order to carry out this task  management prepares three standardized reports with detailed information on the sources of interest income and expense the financial profitability report  the net interest income shock report  and the market value shock report 
the first report deals with historical data while the latter two deal with expected future earnings 
the financial profitability report identifies individual components of the corporation s non trading portfolio independently with their corresponding interest income or expense 
it uses the historical information at the end of each month to track the yield of such components and to calculate net interest income for such time period 

table of contents the net interest income shock report uses a simulation analysis to measure the amount of net interest income the corporation would have from its operations throughout the next twelve months and the sensitivity of these earnings to assumed shifts in market interest rates throughout the same period 
the most important assumptions of this analysis are i rate shifts are parallel and immediate throughout the yield curve  ii rate changes affect all assets and liabilities equally  iii interest bearing demand accounts and savings passbooks will run off in a period of one year  and iv demand deposit accounts will run off in a period of one to three years 
cash flows from assets and liabilities are assumed to be reinvested at market rates in similar instruments 
the objective is to simulate a dynamic gap analysis enabling a more accurate interest rate risk assessment 
nim sensitivity analysis captures the maximum acceptable net interest margin loss for a one percent parallel change of all interest rates across the curve 
duration of market value equity analysis entails a valuation of all interest bearing assets and liabilities under parallel movements in interest rates 
the alco has established limits of million of maximum nim loss for a parallel shock and million maximum mve loss for a parallel shock 
these limits are established annually at the beginning of year and are changed as warranted by market conditions and the corporation s tolerance for possible losses 
the limits established for were million maximum nim loss for a parallel shock and million maximum mve loss for a parallel shock 
as of december   it was determined for purposes of the net interest income shock report that the corporation had a potential loss in net interest income of approximately million if market rates were to increase basis points immediately and parallel across the yield curve  less than the million limit 
for purposes of the market value shock report it was determined that the corporation had a potential loss of approximately million if market rates were to increase basis points immediately parallel across the yield curve  less than the million limit 
the tables below present a summary of the corporation s net interest margin and market value shock reports  considering several scenarios as of december  net interest margin shock report december  in millions bp s bp s bp s base case bp s bp s bp s gross interest margin sensitivity market value shock report december  in millions bp s bp s bp s base case bp s bp s bp s market value of equity sensitivity as of december  the corporation had a liability sensitive profile as explained by the negative gap  the nim shock report and the mve shock report 
management feels comfortable with the current level of market risk on the balance sheet  and it will change the market risk profile of the corporation as market conditions vary 
any decision to reposition the balance sheet is taken by the alco committee  and is subject to compliance with the established risk limits 
some factors that could lead to shifts in policy could be  but are not limited to  changes in views on interest rate markets  monetary policy  macroeconomic factors as well as legal  fiscal and other factors which could lead to shifts in the asset liability mix 

table of contents derivatives the corporation uses derivative financial instruments mostly as hedges of interest rate risk  changes in fair value of assets and liabilities and to secure future cash flows 
refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements for details of the corporation s derivative transactions as of december  and in the normal course of business  the corporation utilizes derivative instruments to manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  currencies and other markets  to meet the needs of customers and for proprietary trading activities 
the corporation uses the same credit risk management procedures to assess and approve potential credit exposures when entering into derivative transactions as those used for traditional lending 

table of contents hedging activities the following table summarizes the derivative contracts designated as hedges as of december   and  respectively december  other comprehensive notional gain income dollars in thousands amounts fair value loss loss cash flow hedges interest rate swaps fair value hedges interest rate swaps totals december  other comprehensive notional gain income dollars in thousands amounts fair value loss loss cash flow hedges foreign currency interest rate swaps fair value hedges interest rate swaps totals december  other comprehensive notional gain income dollars in thousands amounts fair value loss loss cash flow hedges foreign currency interest rate swaps fair value hedges interest rate swaps totals the notional amount represents the gross sum of long and short net of tax cash flow hedges the corporation designates hedges as cash flow hedges when its main purpose is to reduce the exposure associated with the variability of future cash flows related to fluctuations in short term financing rates such as libor 
at the inception of each hedge  management documents the hedging relationship  including its objective and probable effectiveness 
to assess ongoing effectiveness of the hedges  the corporation compares the hedged item s periodic variable rate with the hedging item s benchmark rate libor at every reporting period to determine the effectiveness of the hedge 
any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded currently as a derivative gain or loss in the income statement 

table of contents as of december   the total amount  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive income pertaining to the cash flow hedges was an unrealized loss of million 
as of december   the total amount  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive income pertaining to the cash flow hedges was an unrealized loss of  as of december   the total amount  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive income pertaining to the cash flow hedges was an unrealized gain of million 
fair value hedges the corporation designates hedges as fair value hedges when its main purpose is to hedge the changes in market value of an associated asset or liability 
the corporation only designates these types of hedges if at inception it is believed that the relationship of the changes in the market value of the hedged item and the hedging item will offset each other in a highly effective manner 
at the inception of each hedge  management documents the hedging relationship  including its objective and probable effectiveness 
to assess ongoing effectiveness of the hedges  the corporation marks to market both the hedging item and the hedged item at every reporting period to determine the effectiveness of the hedge 
any hedge ineffectiveness is recorded currently as a derivative gain or loss in the income statement 
the fair value hedges have maturities through the year as of december  and december  the weighted average rate paid and received on these contracts as of december  is and  respectively and and  respectively  as of december   respectively 
the billion and billion fair value hedges are associated to the swapping of fixed rate debt as of december  and  respectively 
the corporation regularly issues term fixed rate debt  which it in turn swaps to floating rate debt via interest rate swaps 
in these cases the corporation matches all of the relevant economic variables notional  coupon  payments dates and conventions etc 
of the fixed rate debt it issues to the fixed rate leg of the interest rate swap which it receives from the counterparty and pays the floating rate leg of the interest rate swap 
the effectiveness of these transactions is very high since all of the relevant economic variables are matched 
derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments any derivative not associated to hedging activity is booked as a freestanding derivative 
in the normal course of business the corporation may enter into derivative contracts as either a market maker or proprietary position taker 
the corporation s mission as a market maker is to meet the clients needs by providing them with a wide array of financial products  which include derivative contracts 
the corporation s major role in this aspect is to serve as a derivative counterparty to these clients 
positions taken with these clients are hedged although not designated as hedges in the otc market with interbank participants or in the organized futures markets 
to a lesser extent  the corporation enters into freestanding derivative contracts as a proprietary position taker  based on market expectations or to benefit from price differentials between financial instruments and markets 
these derivatives are not linked to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to forecasted transactions in an accounting hedge relationship and  therefore  do not qualify for hedge accounting 
these derivatives are carried at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings 
the market and credit risk associated with these activities is measured  monitored and controlled by the corporation s market risk group  an independent division from the treasury department 
among other things  this group is responsible for policy  analysis  methodology and reporting of anything related to market risk and credit risk
