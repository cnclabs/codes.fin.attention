our corporate office is located at west chester pike  suite  west chester  pa our telephone number is nobel learning communities  inc  a delaware corporation  was formed on march  educational philosophy and implementation our educational philosophy is based on a foundation of sound research and innovative instructional strategies  along with quality practices and curricula developed by experienced educators 
our programs stress the development of the whole child and are based on concepts of multi sensory  integrated and age appropriate learning 
our curricula are not only designed to allow each child to develop according to his or her own abilities and timetable  but also seek to prepare every student for achievement in accordance with national content standards and goals 
our schools monitor student progress against curriculum objectives  as well as the development of cognitive  social  emotional and physical skills 
the result is the opportunity for each of our students to develop a strong foundation in academic learning  positive self esteem and emotional and physical well being 
we have created developmental goals and curriculum guidelines for each age level  grade level and content area to assist principals and teachers in planning their daily and weekly programs 
we maintain that small schools  small classes  clearly articulated curricular guidelines and excellent educational materials  delivered by qualified  innovative and enthusiastic teachers comprise the basic ingredients of a quality education 
our philosophy is based on personalized instruction that leads to a student s active involvement in learning and understanding 
the programs for our schools are skills based and delivered through a developmentally appropriate  comprehensive curriculum in each developmental program or grade level 
we implement each curriculum in ways that stimulate a learner s curiosity  support a student s individual learning style and employ processes that contribute to lifelong achievement 
academic areas addressed include reading  writing  spelling  mathematics  science  social studies  visual and graphic arts  music  physical education wellness and world language spanish 
additionally  non cognitive skills or executive skills  such as perseverance  self confidence  self discipline  communication  social responsibility  teamwork and conflict resolution skills are continuously reinforced through curriculum infusion and meta cognitive dialogue 
the critical areas of technology literacy  economics and study skills are integrated into the programs  as appropriate  in most content areas through the use of classroom based technologies  media centers and computer labs 

table of contents athletic activities and supplemental programs our schools offer athletic activities and supplemental programs  which include day field trips coordinated with curriculum to zoos  libraries  museums and theaters and  at the middle schools  overnight trips to such places as national parks and historical locations  and select summer trips to european destinations 
schools arrange classroom presentations by parents  community leaders and other volunteers to supplement instruction

to enhance the child s physical  social  emotional and intellectual growth  schools may provide extra curricular experiences some fee based tailored to particular families interests 
these activities include but are not limited to dance  gymnastics  instrumental music lessons and computer based technology programs 
additionally  students expand their horizons through participation in science fairs  drama clubs and local and regional academic competitions 
this past academic year  we expanded our shared  distance learning projects  called learning without walls  to full rollouts or tests in our th  th  and th grades in our schools around the country 
these programs included a th grade project on global warming  a th grade project on waterways and an th grade project building leadership skills and researching entrepreneurship 
for the upcoming school years our learning without walls projects will be expanded to include the th  th  th  th  and th grades 
this will include the addition of a th grade project exploring mathematics through the examination of systems  and a th grade project which will include an investigation of european countries with a culminating documentary activity 
teachers we recognize that maintaining the quality of our teachers capabilities and professionalism is essential to sustaining our students high level of academic achievement and our profitability 
we sponsor professional development days covering various aspects of teaching and education  using both internal trainers and external consultants 
our educators serve on company task forces and committees that review and revise curricular guidelines  programs  support materials and current teaching methods 
training school based leadership teams principals and assistant principals also actively engage in professional development and self improvement 
staff training is provided by our education department and other experts within the education industry 
through participation in our annual national principals conference  seasoned administrators as well as new recruits are kept abreast of up to date research  changing trends and sound pedagogical practices 
in addition  many of our highest performing principals are utilized as trainers to help with professional development and curriculum implementation in our schools 
accreditation we seek to ensure that our schools meet or exceed the standards of appropriate accrediting agencies through an internal quality assurance program 
although not mandated by any governmental or regulatory authority  many of our schools are accredited  or are currently seeking accreditation through the commission on international and trans regional accreditation cita with various regional accreditation agencies throughout the united states 
regional accreditation agencies include middle states association of colleges and schools north central association of colleges and schools northwest association of accredited schools western association of schools and colleges southern association of colleges and schools the company is currently scheduled to go through cita re accreditation by june 
table of contents school operations standards in order to seek to maintain appropriate standards  our schools share consistent educational goals and operating procedures 
while we have a national curriculum  principals may tailor curricula  within the standards of nobel learning communities  to meet local and state requirements 
members of our management team visit schools and centers on a regular basis to review program  facility and staff quality 
hiring and retaining quality personnel at our schools and in operational management positions is a critical success factor in driving success in both operational and financial performance 
our school principals and assistant principals are responsible for all facets of school operations including curriculum implementation  ensuring student achievement and success  personnel and financial management  community outreach  student discipline and implementing local sales and marketing strategies 
the principals and assistant principals are supported by our regional education and human resources teams and our centralized marketing  real estate  facilities and finance organizations 
we operate and review our performance based on both geographic cluster and individual school based performance 
our operations have annual budgets and financial and operating information is collected daily 
certain measures of school and cluster performance are reviewed weekly and others are reviewed monthly or quarterly to budget depending on the significance to meeting operational and financial objectives 
for example  net revenue  tuition revenue  certain operating costs and student census information are monitored weekly in relation to our objectives 
executive directors executive directors oversee the principals and schools and report to a regional vice president 
executive directors are responsible for ensuring the qualifications of principals and assistant principals  as well as training and development 
school principals and executive directors work closely with regional and corporate management  particularly in the regular assessment of program quality and school performance 
we hire qualified candidates and attempt to promote from within when possible 
candidate credentials are reviewed through employment references  criminal background checks and appropriate education verification in order to establish an understanding of the candidates skills  professionalism and character 
after hiring  it is our policy that employees receive regular performance feedback including a formal annual performance evaluation 
our principals and executive directors may be eligible for incentive compensation based on the performance of their schools 
private pay schools general education schools 
our preschool and elementary middle school strategy is based on clustering of preschools around an elementary school in order to provide a continuum of education and consistent curriculum for children from infancy through th grade 
clusters of schools are placed in geographic markets where the economy and population meet our demographic profile 
in several markets  students from our preschools can easily matriculate into our elementary middle school programs 
in addition  we can potentially convert students from our other specialty programs to our general education programs 
we also operate schools that are not part of a complete geographic cluster 
many of these schools were built or purchased prior to the implementation of our cluster strategy or may be the initial school in a new market 
in some cases  these schools may become part of a cluster if we determine the demographic profile in the market provides a growth opportunity 
we seek to distinguish our schools from our competition with our qualitative and quantitative program outcomes 
our schools generally span a broader range of ages and grades than many of our competitors 
at each age and grade level  we support a child s development with appropriate curriculum based programs 
during the 
table of contents fiscal year ended june   we implemented the roll out of a new national elementary school curriculum for kindergarten through th grade 
this renewed curriculum provides principals and teachers the strong foundations they need to plan and develop student centered lessons that promote high levels of integration  differentiation and opportunities for authentic assessment 
during the fiscal year ended june   we finished the roll out of a new national preschool curriculum for children between six weeks and five years of age 
this curriculum  called links to learning  is a three tiered academic program 
it provides teachers with a scope and sequence for developmentally appropriate skill introduction  integration and acquisition 
the program also provides quality control instruments for principals and offers strong communication materials for parents through curriculum connected print materials  developmental communications and authentic assessment 
we foster an individualized approach to learning in small group sizes and integrate the fundamental preschool areas of language and literacy  mathematics  community  world languages  social and emotional development  art  music  and wellness 
further  in certain elementary locations  we provide programs and schools for the learning challenged as well as special purpose high schools 
we believe that empirical data as well as quantitative results support the quality of our programs 
standardized test results have consistently shown that our students perform at or above national grade performance norms in reading and mathematics 
many of our preschools and elementary schools allow for early drop off and late pick up to accommodate parent schedules 
in most preschool locations  programs are available for children starting at six weeks of age 
we believe that parents can feel comfortable leaving their children at one of our schools knowing the children will receive both a quality education and engage in well supervised developmental  recreational and enrichment activities 
most of our preschools and elementary schools complement their educational programs with enrichment programs  arts programs  before and after school programs and summer programs or camps 
in addition to those revenue generating programs  our schools seek to improve margins by providing ancillary services and products  such as portrait photos  books and uniform sales 
before and after school programs 
during fiscal the company acquired the enchanted care learning centers in the central ohio market 
in addition to nine preschools  these centers include six standalone buildings operating as kid s campuses 
the kid s campus locations provide before and after programs in state of the art facilities dedicated exclusively to elementary school aged children 
the programs help children mature socially and academically  and our well trained teachers learn and work with a child s individual learning style 
we offer a variety of activities and resources  including computer animal science lab a place to learn about different animals while developing computer and research skills basketball gym fully equipped for healthy competition  fitness and team building music drama dance stage activities incorporate costumes  dance  drama and music and culminate in fun theatrical productions art studio children explore their creativity through painting  drawing  and sculpting movie theatre a full schedule of educational and exciting films fill our big screen cafeteria make bake kitchen children learn what makes up a nutritious meal  while picking up basic cooking and baking skills homework library a quiet place to do homework  study  read and interact with teachers 
the kid s campuses also provide locations where we offer summer camp programs for preschool and school age children 

table of contents the kid s campus locations  plus one additional before and after school location acquired in the dallas area and operating as part of our merry hill schools  provide additional growth potential in existing and new markets for the company 
organization sponsored centers 
during fiscal  the company was awarded a contract to operate the esther peterson child development center at the department of labor in washington  dc this school is the company s first corporate market model school serving a defined customer base  usually with a common employer  and many times with some revenue or expense subsidy 
the second type of this model is our school at the university of illinois research park  which has some portion of the land cost and enrollment slots supported by outside organizations 
this school opened august  this differs from the rest of our schools  which serve the general public and do not have a company or organization support and some financial aspect of the school 
this delivery model represents a new market opportunity for the company 
the company does not specifically seek out this type of preschool model  but will respond to requests from sponsoring organizations  when appropriate  given our operating model and our geographic market coverage 
paladin academy 
our paladin academy school and programs serve the needs of children with mild to moderate learning challenges from kindergarten through th grade 
our mission is to improve the learning process and achievement levels of children with dyslexia  attention deficit disorder  dysgraphia and other mild learning difficulties through stand alone schools and school based programs 
we offer developmental testing  full day clinics and summer programs 
the primary goals of our paladin academy program is to enable students to mainstream back into the general school population 
we operate one stand alone paladin academy school and six school based programs or clinics integrated within our elementary schools 
paladin academy schools and or programs are now located in florida  north carolina  pennsylvania and virginia 
at the end of fiscal  we re located our stand alone paladin academy to a new site in the existing geographic market area 
houston learning academy 
under the name houston learning academy hla  we operate five special purpose high schools in the houston metropolitan marketplace 
hla schools  which are fully accredited by the southern association of colleges and schools  offer a half day high school program  as well as evening and summer school programs 
hla also provides a tutor and special education classes in a residential hospital 
hla schools and programs feature individualized attention  primarily for those students who are at risk of not completing their high school requirements in a more traditional setting and or are attracted to the schools program and flexible hours of service 
marketing we generate new enrollments primarily from word of mouth recommendations from parents  direct mail campaigns  internet advertising  search engine marketing  yellow page listings  print advertisements and public relations programs 
we market to our own database of inquirers through ongoing direct mail and email communications 
we also have developed a sophisticated search engine marketing program over the internet to develop new customer leads that support each individual market and can be customized to the products and programs in each individual school by market 
marketing efforts are directed by a central marketing team working with school operations management and the education team to develop consistent brand positioning and communication strategies  with the goal of continuously improving customer acquisition and retention 
our marketing team conducts enrollment marketing campaigns throughout the year in each of our geographic areas and centrally supports our school clusters and individual schools 
these major campaigns are supplemented by community based activities conducted by our local executive directors and principals 

table of contents our annual marketing calendar is synchronized to the typical customer demand cycle for enrollment 
we direct marketing resources towards our preschool enrollments during spring and summer and towards our elementary middle schools during fall and winter 
to a lesser degree  there is enrollment activity in the other seasonal periods for all schools 
the company has implemented a number of marketing communication tools to strengthen our communications with existing customers and increase customer retention and length of stay 
these tools include  but are not limited to  e mail based newsletters  enhanced school specific websites and updated in school and in classroom communication materials 
corporate development strategy and implementation our growth strategy in the private education market includes internal growth of our enrollment at existing schools  expansion of current facilities  new school development in both existing and new markets and strategic acquisitions 
much of our focus is on increasing occupancy and ancillary program revenue in our existing schools and leveraging the investment in those assets 
management has implemented new training programs designed to strengthen principals and executive directors sales and customer service skills and invests in school administrative staffing 
in addition  to broaden the potential career path opportunities for employees  we have provided employees the ability to move between locations as appropriate opportunities arise 
the similar business and education model our schools operate under permits the company to execute on this career path strategy 
as our growth has increased  we now have a number of examples where our principals or assistant principals have transferred to other schools in different geographic markets 
while a portion of our efforts have focused on improving the performance of existing schools  the company continues its increased efforts to identify opportunities to develop and open new schools and to acquire schools in support of our demographically profiled geographic market cluster strategy  in both existing and new markets 
while we do not currently anticipate exiting any of our geographic markets  we regularly analyze the profitability of our existing school and real estate portfolio to identify schools that are underperforming and or do not fit our business model or demographic based geographic cluster strategies 
we then develop plans either to improve these schools or remove them from our portfolio 
this represents an important activity in reallocating capital to the balance of our schools in order to ensure the continued improvement of our program offerings and overall company performance 
new school development during the first quarter of fiscal  the company opened two additional preschools and has three preschools and one middle school expansion under construction 
for new school development we typically engage a developer or contractor to build a facility to our specifications 
we also look to occupy existing buildings that are appropriate for our schools and that are located in growth areas that meet our demographic requirements 
the company continues  as part of its strategy  to focus on private pay markets supported by complementary demographics 
our new school development strategy builds upon our practice of clustering of preschools around an elementary school in order to provide a continuum of education and consistent curriculum for children from infancy through th grade 
clusters of schools are placed in geographic markets where the economy and population meet our demographic profile 
in several markets  students from our preschools can easily matriculate into our elementary middle school programs 
in addition  we can potentially convert students from our specialty and before and after programs to our general education programs 

table of contents acquisitions we expect to use strategic acquisitions to expand our business 
key acquisition criteria include reputation  location in markets meeting our target demographics  growth prospects  quality of personnel and the ability to integrate into existing market clusters or become the platform for new market clusters 
our acquisition strategy primarily focuses on schools that fit our demographic and cluster strategy and which serve the preschool and or kindergarten through eighth grade market  either directly serving the consumer or supporting a corporation or other entity in providing preschool and other related services to their employees 
from time to time we evaluate opportunities which  while all related in educational content  may provide the company entry into a variety of other business models 
these may include companies that have business models that focus on enrichment programs  summer camps  technology based before and after schools programs  high school grades  and the use of our existing concepts with a focus on international students or entry into international education markets 
the company seeks to identify acquisition opportunities at appropriate prices that will allow the acquisition to create stockholder value in an appropriate time frame 
at the end of fiscal  the company made its first acquisitions in over three years 
the company has continued to acquire schools since the end of fiscal these acquisitions demonstrate two different approaches to implementing the company s strategy 
the honor roll school acquisition allowed the company to enter a new geographic market by purchasing an already successful k program 
this acquisition provided the company the opportunity to expand the honor roll school brand by developing or acquiring new preschools in the houston market to develop a robust feeder system to the k school 
the company also entered a new geographic market with the acquisition of the six discovery isle preschools in san diego  california 
in this case  the acquisition provides the company the opportunity to expand the discovery isle preschool brand through the development or acquisition of additional preschools and also add elementary and or middle school s that could utilize the discovery isle preschools as a feeder system for elementary school students 
during fiscal the company acquired enchanted care learning centers  and as described under the private pay schools section above  the acquisition included six standalone facilities offering before and after school programs for elementary school age children under the kid s campus trade name 
this acquisition provides the company opportunities in existing or new geographic markets to further develop its growth strategy 
in addition  the fiscal acquisition of the ivy glen schools in the dallas market also provided the company with one standalone before and after school program 
the table below gives the company s recent history of acquisitions number of facilities acquired market name of acquisition fiscal year acquired preschool prek k before and after description n ew or e xisting the honor roll school sugarland  tx n discovery isle san diego  ca n learning ladder lancaster  pa e teddy bear treehouse san diego  ca e ivy glen schools dallas  tx e enchanted care learning centers columbus  oh n camelback desert schools phoenix  az n southern highlands preparatory schools las vegas  nv e ivy kids early learning center missouri city  tx e before and after facilities are intergral to adjacent school facilities and as such are not incremental to total school count 

table of contents in conjunction with the acquisition of learning ladder schools the company determined one location would be closed 
this location is included in acquired schools and closed locations in the rollforward provided under the management discussion and analysis section below 
seasonality our elementary middle schools historically have lower operating revenues in the summer due to the end of the traditional academic year and seasonally lower enrollment and related fees in summer programs 
summer revenues of preschools are  to a lesser degree  subject to the same seasonality 
management seeks to reduce the seasonal fluctuations of the company s revenue stream by adding to its schools a mix of products and services  such as camp programs  in the lower revenue seasons 
industry and competition education reform movements in the united states are providing new alternatives to the public schools 
these reforms include charter schools  private management of public schools  home schooling  private schools  virtual schools and voucher programs 
our strategy is to provide parents a quality alternative to public schools through our privately owned and operated schools  utilizing proven curriculum in a safe and challenging environment 
while our schools do not currently reside in any school voucher markets  we believe voucher programs may be a positive development for our schools  should we choose to accept them 
we consider each of these alternatives to be competition for our schools and the expansion or contraction of funding and or public support of these alternatives may impact the demand for our product  available real estate and our ability to increase or maintain our operating margins 
furthermore  we compete with other for profit private schools  charter schools  non profit schools  sectarian schools and home schooling 
we also face competition with respect to preschool services and before and after school programs from public schools  government based providers and religiously affiliated  community based or other non profit programs that may offer such services at little or no cost to parents 
we anticipate that  given the perceived potential of the education market  well financed competition may emerge  including possible competition from the large for profit child care companies and international school operators 
we believe the only large for profit competitors that integrate preschool  elementary education and school age programs and that currently compete beyond a regional level are privately held knowledge learning corp  bright horizons family solutions  inc and mini skools and publicly held abc learning abs 
ax 
we also face competition in each of our demographic markets from local operators of individually owned private schools 
finally  public school systems may become stronger competitors at the preschool level if additional states pass or expand universal pre k legislation that provides public funds for preschool for three and four year olds and do not allow for profit preschool operators to participate in these programs  or fund payments to for profit operators at lower than market prices or costs 
while price is an important factor in competing in both the preschool and elementary school markets  we believe that other competitive factors also are important  including professionally developed educational programs  qualified and trained school administrators  well equipped facilities  trained teachers and a broad range of ancillary services  including before and after school programs  transportation and infant care 
some of these services are not offered by some of our competitors 
we conduct annual tuition rate surveys and believe we are competitively priced in each of our markets 
regulation our schools are subject to national  state and local regulations and licensing requirements 
we have policies and procedures in place to assist in complying with such regulations and requirements 
these regulations and the administrative bodies in charge of these regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and may apply differently within the same jurisdiction to a preschool  elementary or middle school 
the regulatory and licensing 
table of contents requirements tend to be more stringent with respect to preschools  as government agencies generally review the fitness and adequacy of buildings and equipment  the ratio of staff personnel to enrolled children  staff training  record keeping  children s dietary program  daily curriculum and compliance with health and safety standards 
in most jurisdictions  these agencies conduct scheduled and unscheduled inspections of the schools and licenses must be renewed periodically 
most jurisdictions establish requirements for background checks or other clearance procedures for new employees of schools 
repeated failures of a school to comply with applicable regulations can subject the school to sanctions  which might include probation or  in more serious cases  suspension or revocation of the school s license to operate and could also lead to investigations of our other schools located in the same jurisdiction 
in addition  this type of action could lead to negative publicity extending beyond that jurisdiction and potentially affecting our other locations 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with all material regulations applicable to our business 
however  there is no assurance that a licensing authority will not determine a particular school to be in violation of applicable regulations and take action against that school and possibly other schools in the same jurisdiction 
in addition  there may be unforeseen changes in regulations and licensing requirements  such as changes in the required ratio of child center staff personnel to enrolled children that could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
states in which we operate routinely review the adequacy of regulatory and licensing requirements and implement changes  which may significantly increase our costs to operate in those states 
environmental compliance we are not aware of any existing environmental conditions that currently or in the future could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  operating results or cash flows and we have not incurred material expenditures to address environmental conditions at any school 
although we have periodically conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our schools  we have not undertaken an in depth environmental review of all of our schools and accordingly  there may be material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware 
in addition  no assurances can be given that future laws or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability 
insurance we currently maintain comprehensive general liability  workers compensation  automobile liability  property  excess umbrella liability  terrorism  student accident insurance and directors and officers liability insurance 
the policies provide a variety of coverages and limits 
companies involved in the education and care of children  however  may not be able to obtain insurance for the total risks inherent in their operations 
in particular  general liability coverage can have sublimits per claim for child abuse 
although we believe we have adequate insurance coverage at this time  claims in excess of  or not included within  our coverage may be asserted 
in addition  there can be no assurance that in future years we will not become subject to lower limits or substantial increase in insurance premiums 
employees as of september   we employed approximately  persons 
none of the company s employees are represented by a labor union 
we believe that our relationship with our employees is satisfactory 
recently the child care industry in general saw an increase in organized labor contacts with child care workers and preschool teachers  especially in states such as washington and california 
while there have been no specific attempts to organize our teachers or other employees  there is no assurance that in future years we or the industry will not be subject to some form of labor organization attempt

risk factors 
each of the following risks  individually or in a group  could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
the company s ability to hire and retain qualified executive directors  principals  teachers and teachers aides the company may experience difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in various markets necessary to meet growth opportunities 
hiring and retaining qualified personnel may require increased salaries and enhanced benefits in more competitive markets 
difficulties in hiring and retaining qualified personnel may also impact the company s ability to obtain additional  and retain existing enrollment at its preschools and elementary schools 
in addition  while the company s wage ranges are generally materially above minimum wage  recent federal and state changes to the minimum wage may reduce the qualified applicant pool or increase our wage costs 
the company s ability to retain key individuals in acquired schools and or successfully identify  acquire  grow and integrate acquired schools operations acquisitions are an ongoing part of the company s growth strategy 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including potential difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  not meeting financial objectives  additional need for capital investment  undisclosed liabilities not covered by insurance or indemnification provisions in the acquisition agreement  diversion of management s attention in connection with an acquisition and potential loss of key employees of the acquired operation 
no assurance can be given as to the success of the company in identifying  executing and assimilating acquisitions in the future or the ability to identify satisfactory acquisition targets and successfully complete any acquisition 
the company s inability to defend successfully against or counter negative publicity associated with claims involving alleged incidents at its schools because of the nature of its business  the company is and expects that in the future it will be subject to claims and litigation alleging negligence  inadequate supervision and other grounds for liability arising from injuries or other harm to the people it serves  primarily children 
in addition  claimants may seek damages from the company for child abuse  sexual abuse and other acts allegedly committed by company employees 
there can be no assurance that additional lawsuits will not be filed  that the company s insurance will be adequate to cover liabilities resulting from any claim or that any such claim or the publicity resulting from it will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition including  without limitation  adverse effects caused by increased cost or decreased availability of insurance and decreased demand for the company s services 

table of contents changing economic conditions the company s revenue and net income are subject to general economic conditions 
the company s revenues depend  in part  on the number of dual income families and working single parents who require child development  child care or educational services 
a deterioration of general economic conditions  including a soft housing market  may adversely impact the company because of the tendency of out of work parents to diminish or discontinue utilization of these services 
in addition  the company may not be able to increase tuition at a rate consistent with increases in wages  health insurance and other operating costs or continue tuition increases at historical rates experienced in the industry 
in addition  there can be no assurance that demographic trends  including the number of dual income families in the work force  will continue to lead to increased market share 
recently  the economy and cost of energy has caused some public school systems to study moving to a four day school week or year round school calendar 
to the extent that there are any material changes to the traditional school year schedule  it may impact our business  although we do not have an indication as to whether these changes will be implemented in any of our markets and if so  what the impact on our business may be 
additionally  due to the rising price of fuel  many public school systems are changing their policy relating to providing transportation for children within the school district  but who attend private school 
while we have few schools whose students receive transportation through public school systems  there may be some minimal impact on students in some of our schools  should the public school systems change their transportation policies 
competitive conditions in the pre school and elementary school education and services industry the company competes for individual enrollment in a highly fragmented market 
for enrollment  the company competes with residential based child care operated out of the caregiver s home and center based child care which may include work site child care centers  full and part time child care centers and preschools  private and public elementary schools  and church affiliated and other not for profit providers and schools 
in addition  substitutes for organized preschool  child care  and educational services  such as relatives and others caring for a child or home schooling  can represent lower cost alternatives to the company s services 
management believes the company s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including qualifications of principals and teachers  quality of care  quality of curriculum  site convenience and cost 
the company often is at a price disadvantage with respect to these alternative providers  who operate with little or no rental expense  little or no curriculum expense  and generally may not comply or are not required to comply with the same health  safety  insurance and operational regulations as the company 
competitors in the private pay education service segment also may offer similar or competing services at a lower price than the company and some may have access to greater financial resources than the company 
the company also competes with many not for profit providers of child care and preschools  as well as elementary schools  some of which are able to offer lower pricing than the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
the company s ability to find affordable real estate and renew existing locations on terms acceptable to the company the company may experience an inability to identify and successfully negotiate or renew existing leases at attractive rents  which may impact the company s profitability 
in addition  if the company cannot renew school leases for an appropriate term length  it may impact enrollment should parents become concerned with the length of time a school will remain open in a particular location 
the company s ability to obtain the capital required to implement fully its business and strategic plan our ability to execute our business and strategic plan is dependent upon the availability of adequate financing sources on acceptable terms 
our efforts to execute our business plan and open or acquire new schools are subject to our ability to finance such growth 
in the event current financing resources are inadequate to support new school openings or acquisitions from time to time  we may be required to seek additional capital to 
table of contents support such expansion efforts 
such additional capital may take the form of the issuance of debt or equity securities  among other forms 
beyond our existing revolving senior credit facility  we presently have no commitments to provide the company with any additional capital should we determine that additional capital is required 
in the event that management determines that additional capital is required to support the company s business and strategic plan  there is no assurance that we will be able to secure such financing on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to secure needed additional capital  our growth efforts may be curtailed and we may have to forego opening or acquiring new schools 
government regulations affecting school operations the company s locations are subject to numerous national  state and local regulations and licensing requirements 
although these regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction  government agencies generally review  among other things  the adequacy of buildings and equipment  licensed capacity  the ratio of staff to children  educational qualifications of teachers and staff training  record keeping  the dietary program  the daily curriculum  hiring practices and compliance with health and safety standards 
failure of any location to comply with applicable regulations and requirements could subject it to governmental sanctions  which might include fines  corrective orders  probation  or  in more serious cases  suspension or revocation of the location s license to operate or an award of damages to private litigants and could require significant expenditures by the company to bring its location into compliance

the establishment of government mandated universal pre k or similar programs or benefits that do not allow for participation by for profit operators or allows for participation at low reimbursement rates national  state or local child care and early age education benefit programs relying primarily on subsidies in the form of tax credits or other direct financial aid could provide the company opportunities for expansion in additional markets  especially where these benefits are universal based on residency and age  as opposed to those based on socio economic need or measures 
however  a universal benefit with governmentally mandated or publicly provided child care could reduce the demand for educational services at the company s existing locations

environmental or health related events that could affect schools in areas impacted by such events a regional or global health pandemic could severely disrupt our business 
a health pandemic is a disease that spreads rapidly and widely by infection and affects many individuals in an area or population at the same time 
if a regional or global health pandemic were to occur  depending upon its severity and duration  the company s business could be severely affected 
enrollment in our schools could experience sharp declines as parents might avoid taking their children out in public in the event of a health pandemic  and local  regional or national governments might limit or ban public interactions to halt or delay the spread of disease causing business disruptions and the temporary closure of our schools 
additionally  a health pandemic could also impair our ability to hire and retain an adequate level of staff 
the impact of a health pandemic on the company might be disproportionately greater than on other companies that depend less on the interaction of people for the sale of their products and services 

table of contents our financial and operating performance may be adversely affected by acts of god  such as natural disasters  in locations where we own and or lease school properties 
some types of losses  such as those from earthquakes  hurricanes  terrorism and environmental hazards  may be either uninsurable or too expensive to justify insuring against 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the school
