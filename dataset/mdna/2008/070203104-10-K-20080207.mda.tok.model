item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview bassett furniture industries  incorporated together with its consolidated subsidiaries  bassett  we  our or the company  based in bassett  va  is a leading retailer  manufacturer and marketer of branded home furnishings 
our products are sold primarily through bassett furniture direct stores  with secondary distribution through bassett design centers and other multi line furniture stores 
bassettbaby cribs and casegoods are sold through specialty stores and mass merchants 
we were founded in and incorporated under the laws of virginia in our rich year history has instilled the principles of quality  value  and integrity in everything that we do  while simultaneously providing us with the expertise to respond to ever changing consumer tastes and to meet the demands of a global economy two primary business developments continue to affect our business as they have for nearly a decade 
first  we created and re channeled sales through a vertically integrated retail store network 
the bassett furniture direct bfd or store store program was created in as a single source home furnishings retail store that provides a unique combination of stylish  well made furniture and accessories with a high level of customer service 
this service includes complimentary room planning  in home design visits  fast delivery  and custom order furniture 
this strategy both builds on our strengths brand name  balance sheet  product offerings and better positions us to capitalize on the changing furniture retail environment 
this store network currently includes licensee owned stores and company owned and operated stores 
second  the furniture industry continues to experience a rapid shift from traditional domestic manufacturing to offshore sourcing in lower cost markets  primarily in china and other pacific rim countries 
this shift in sourcing has resulted in downward pressure on retail prices and reductions in traditional channels of sales distribution 
many retailers now source their own products rather than relying on a traditional domestic manufacturer to supply goods 
sales of imported products increased to of our total wholesale volume 
we expect this to increase to approximately in we have responded to these changes by reducing manufacturing production where we can more cost efficiently source product 
over the last seven years  we have reduced the number of facilities from to  and reduced our headcount from approximately  to  during  we closed a large wood manufacturing facility in bassett  va 
this resulted in headcount reductions of approximately employees and leaves us with one wood assembly plant in martinsville  va  one fiberboard supply facility in bassett  va  and one upholstery facility in newton  nc we have closed and consolidated seven wood factories over the past six years 
we intend to execute our strategies in such a way as to preserve our investments while simultaneously minimizing the need for borrowed funds 
maintenance of a strong balance sheet is a stated management goal and vital to our retail growth strategy 
the store program entails key business risks  including the realization of receivables and the coverage of both direct and contingent liabilities primarily associated with retail real estate 
we have established decision criteria and business disciplines aimed at minimizing potential losses from these risks 
overall conditions for our industry and our company have been difficult throughout with new housing starts down significantly and a deteriorating consumer credit environment 
with that as a backdrop  we have continued to invest in the long term health and future of our retail network 
although we believe will continue to be difficult  we plan simultaneously to continue to adjust our overall cost structure and further evaluate the performance of our corporate and licensee stores while properly supporting our retail initiatives that are the foundation of the company s future plans 
restatement of ihfc financial statements during the fourth quarter of  ihfc determined that the method of accounting for its post retirement health care plan did not conform to the requirements of sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and restated its and operating results 
as a result of this restatement and in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  we have restated the balance of our equity investment as of the beginning of the year ended november  by increasing the negative balance in the investment by reflected as distributions in excess of affiliate earnings in the consolidated balance sheet  increasing deferred tax assets by and reducing retained earnings by due to the immateriality of the effects of the ihfc restatement on the company s statements of operations and cash flows for and  no adjustments have been recorded in those previously reported statements  however  was recorded as a reduction to the income recognized in as the cumulative impact of and unrecorded expense 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we use our best judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external advice 
estimates are based on current facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of bassett furniture industries  incorporated and its majority owned subsidiaries for whom we have operating control 
we also consolidate variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary 
allowance for accounts and notes receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of specifically identified accounts and notes receivable in addition to an overall aging analysis 
we evaluate the collectibility of our receivables from our licensees on a quarterly basis 
our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of potential losses on our accounts and notes receivables and is adjusted accordingly based on historical experience  current developments and economic trends 
actual losses could differ from those estimates 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined for domestic furniture inventories using the last in  first out method 
the cost of imported inventories is determined on a first in  first out basis 
we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
investments investments are marked to market and recorded at their fair value 
we account for the alternative asset fund by marking it to market value each month based on the net asset values provided by the general partner 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related income tax effect  on available for sale securities are excluded from income and are reported as other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses from securities classified as available for sale are included in income and are determined using the specific identification method for ascertaining the cost of securities sold 
goodwill as specified in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for business combinations  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the value assigned to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
our policy is to perform the annual impairment analysis as of the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter 
sfas no 
also requires that the assets and liabilities acquired and the resulting goodwill be allocated to the entity s respective reporting units 
we have identified three reporting units for our business wholesale  retail and real estate investments 
the required impairment test is a two step process 
the first step compares the carrying value of each reporting unit that has goodwill with the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit 
should the carrying value of a reporting unit be in excess of the estimated fair value of that reporting unit  the second step is performed whereby we must calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
this second step represents a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if we had acquired the reporting unit on that date 
our impairment methodology uses a discounted cash flow analysis requiring certain assumptions and estimates to be made regarding future profitability of the reporting unit and industry economic factors 
while we believe such assumptions and estimates are reasonable  the actual results may differ materially from the projected amounts 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership and title to the product have transferred to the buyer 
this generally occurs upon the shipment of goods to independent dealers or  in the case of company owned retail stores  upon delivery to the customer 
our terms vary from to days 
an estimate for returns and allowances has been provided in recorded sales 
the contracts with our licensee store owners do not provide for any royalty or license fee to be paid to us 
we are responsible for paying the delivery cost of our products 
as part of our efforts to standardize wholesale pricing throughout the country  we began in july invoicing all of the store network and certain wholesale customers on a fully landed basis such that the invoice price includes the freight charge for delivery 
this business change resulted in approximately  of additional reported revenue and selling  general and administrative expenses for we expect the impact on sales to be significantly higher than that reported for since will include a full year under the new practice 
loss reserves we have a number of other potential loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims  product liability  litigation  restructuring charges  and the recoverability of deferred income tax benefits 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires estimates and judgment with regard to maximum risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are often developed with the assistance of appropriate advisors  and are based on our current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcomes of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future 
analysis of operations summarized consolidated operating information is as follows november  november  november  net sales gross profit sg a restructuring  asset impairment charges and other one time items  net operating income loss other income  net tax expense benefit net income loss sales for the year ended november  were  as compared to  for and  in  representing decreases of and  respectively 
the reported sales were positively impacted by a change in our invoicing practices with respect to freight for the delivery of wholesale furniture to our retail stores 
during july  we began invoicing these customers on a fully landed basis such that the dealer invoice price includes the freight charge for delivery 
this change positively impacted reported revenue by approximately  excluding the effects of the invoicing change  sales decreased for these shortfalls are primarily due to continued soft furniture retail conditions  which have impacted both retail sales and wholesale shipments in both and gross margins for   and were   and  respectively 
excluding the effects of the above mentioned invoicing change  gross margins would have been for the increase over is due primarily to improved retail margins and a shift in wood product mix from domestic to imported  partially offset by the wind down costs and inventory markdowns associated with the closure of the bassett plant and lower volumes in our two domestic production facilities 
the gross margin increase in as compared to is due primarily to the inclusion of more retail stores which carry a higher gross margin and improved wholesale import product mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  for  primarily due to the inclusion of  from the change in our invoicing practices described above  the additional expense associated with more company owned stores  spending to support our key retail initiatives and increases to recorded reserves primarily for bad debts

in the first quarter of  we announced the closing of our wood manufacturing facility in bassett  va 
as a result  we recorded  of asset impairment charges and of restructuring charges largely related to severance 
we have begun to experience gross margin improvement as we have effectively sourced certain of the products previously produced at the plant from overseas vendors 
we also took a number of other actions to reduce our overall expense structure 
these included making a decision to exit four store locations and reducing the size of our wholesale showroom by more than half 
we recorded pretax non cash charges of  related to lease exit costs and for an asset impairment charge related to the downsizing of our wholesale showroom 
we have negotiated subleases on two of the closed store locations and are actively marketing the other locations 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a pretax charge of  related to a settlement and debt restructuring with the minority interest partners of lrg furniture  llc 
this charge is recorded in lrg settlement and debt restructuring in the consolidated statement of operations 
as part of the settlement  we purchased the remaining interest in lrg and restructured certain debt obligations to be paid out over the next six years 
earnings for and were positively impacted by  and  respectively  of income related to subsidies received in connection with the continued dumping and subsidy offset act cdsoa for wooden bedroom furniture imported from china 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a  charge associated with the impairment of previously recorded goodwill 
during fiscal year  we closed our wood manufacturing facility in mt 
airy  nc  due to excess domestic capacity as we continued to experience a shift in demand from domestically produced products to imported products 
this resulted in a charge of  for impaired assets and severance 
segment information we have strategically aligned our business into three reportable segments wholesale  retail and investments real estate 
the wholesale home furnishings segment is involved principally in the design  manufacture  sourcing  sale and distribution of furniture products to a network of bassett stores licensee owned stores and company owned retail stores and independent furniture retailers 
our wholesale segment includes our wood and upholstery operations as well as all corporate selling  general and administrative expenses  including those corporate expenses related to both corporate and licensee owned stores 
during the second quarter of  we sold our contemporary furniture business weiman  which was previously included in this segment 
our retail segment consists of company owned stores 
our retail segment includes the revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities including real estate and capital expenditures directly related to these stores 
our investments real estate segment consists of our investments alternative asset fund and marketable securities  distributions in excess of affiliate earnings ihfc and retail real estate related to licensee stores 
wholesale segment net sales gross profit sg a operating earnings loss fiscal as compared to fiscal wholesale net sales for the year ended november  were  as compared to  for the year ended november  excluding the  increase in recorded revenue due to the invoicing change described above  sales decreased  or year over year 
approximately of wholesale shipments during were imported products compared to for we expect sales of imported products to increase to approximately for gross margins were for the year ended november  excluding the effects of the invoicing change described above  gross margins would have been as compared to for margins have been negatively impacted by the wind down costs and inventory markdowns associated with the closure of the bassett plant and lower volumes in our two domestic production facilities 
we experienced increased margins  particularly during the fourth quarter of  as a greater portion of our wholesale shipments were of higher margin imported product 
we expect improved wholesale operating results in from a full year of improved product mix  the absence of any bassett plant closing costs and efforts to reduce variable spending in the remaining facilities and corporate support areas 
with the continued difficult furniture retail environment  we will continue to assess and adjust our wholesale cost structure to match associated demand 
fiscal as compared to fiscal in  wholesale sales were  as compared to  below sales levels attained in approximately of wholesale shipments during were imported products compared to for gross margins for were as compared to for this improvement was primarily driven by an improved mix of imported products and the performance of the upholstery division 
upholstery shipments and operating earnings continued to improve due to the retail acceptance of our custom programs and the new imported leather products introduced over the past several years 
wholesale shipments by category for the last three fiscal years are summarized below wood upholstery other total retail segment company owned stores net sales gross profit sg a operating earnings losses fiscal as compared to fiscal our corporate stores made progress despite difficult conditions at retail 
net sales increased  from  in to  in this sales increase primarily resulted from the additional company owned stores acquired in and increases in comparable store sales sales for stores open for longer than one year 
comparable store sales for company owned stores increased for the year 
gross margins for the year increased  due to improved pricing and promotional strategies  coupled with less clearance sales activity as compared to we believe that the combination of new product introductions  store prototype retrofits  better hiring and training of design consultants and continued improved marketing efforts will lead to the further improvement in retail operating results 
effective november   we acquired the operations of two stores in the charleston  south carolina area from a licensee for its net book value 
immediately upon acquisition  we began the process of closing one of the stores 
subsequent to year end  we entered into an agreement to acquire the real estate for these stores from this licensee for  these acquisitions will be funded through a combination of the existing licensee s accounts payable to us and additional debt of between  and  fiscal as compared to fiscal our corporate stores experienced soft conditions at retail 
net sales for the retail segment increased nearly in from  primarily due to having a full year of sales from the additional stores purchased in for our stores that were in operation in both and  we experienced slight sales decreases  primarily due to overall soft retail conditions 
our gross margin decreased percentage points in from  primarily due to selling selected products at clearance prices in order to prepare for the arrival of new products and featured catalog products  promotions geared to respond to the overall soft market conditions  and the discounting related to the clearance events at the two stores that were closed 
retail sg a increased from  in to  in this increase was anticipated and was due almost entirely to adding the expense structure of the stores acquired during sales in were more than below the levels anticipated which resulted in a higher sg a percentage as a large majority of these costs are relatively fixed in nature 
investment and real estate segment and other items affecting net income loss our investments and real estate segment consists of our investments alternative asset fund and marketable securities  distributions in excess of affiliate earnings ihfc and retail real estate related to licensee bfd stores 
although this segment does not have operating earnings  income from the segment is included in income from investments in our consolidated statements of operations 
our equity investment in ihfc is not included in the identifiable assets of this segment since it has a negative book value and is therefore included in the long term liabilities section of our consolidated balance sheet 
income and expense items for fiscal  and are as follows income from investments income from unconsolidated affiliated companies  net interest expense income from investments for was below the levels realized in and  primarily due to a decrease in investment return from the alternative asset fund 
even though the fund s performance for was below our expectations  for a period of high volatility and intense risk aversion  we believe that the fund held up well 
we also believe that the fund s orientation toward capital preservation is prudent in a market characterized by increased volatility  deteriorating consumer credit  prolonged weakness in the residential real estate market  and mounting concern over the degree of economic slowdown 
income from unconsolidated affiliated companies  net includes income from our investment in ihfc as well as income loss from other equity method investments 
we recognized income from ihfc of   and  in  and  respectively 
significant fluctuations have been primarily caused by losses recognized related to our previous investment in bfd northeast  llc bfdne of and  in and  respectively 
on february   we entered into an agreement with bfdne whereby we contributed our interest in bfdne to bfdne in exchange for certain assets primarily inventory and leasehold improvements of bfdne s two stores in boston  massachusetts 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was  and for  and the effective tax rate in all years was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to exclusions for dividends received from our investment in ihfc 
in addition  we recorded a tax charge of  in associated with the write off of deferred tax assets due to the termination of the lrg partnership 
our effective rate for was also increased by the write off of goodwill associated with our retail segment as it was not tax deductible 
liquidity and capital resources the company is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in order to weather difficult industry conditions  allow it to take advantage of opportunities as market conditions improve  and to execute its long term retail growth strategies 
we have million outstanding on our revolving line of credit 
as we have  of availability under our revolving line of credit and a sizeable investment portfolio  our balance sheet remains strong and continues to bolster our retail growth strategy  which includes entering into operating leases and lease and loan guarantees for our licensees 
our primary sources of funds in and have been income from investments  including dividends from ihfc  revolver borrowings  and cash received on the sale of certain assets associated with the closed facilities 
cash was primarily used to fund operations and pay dividends 
in  our primary sources of funds were from operations and dividends from ihfc which were used to pay dividends and make capital investments 
the current ratio at november  and november  was to and to  respectively 
working capital was  and  at november  and november   respectively 
net cash generated by used in operating activities was   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the cash deficit for was driven by the net operating loss and the increase in net working capital 
the deficit for was primarily driven by increases in net working capital  partially offset by positive net earnings 
the cash flow from operations in was primarily due to the net income recognized 
during and  decreased customer traffic and retail sales trends negatively impacted our licensees cash flow and in turn the timing of our wholesale collections 
as part of the improvement plans with certain of our licensees  we converted approximately  of trade accounts receivable to long term interest bearing notes during the year ended november  we continually assess our levels of bad debt reserves and increased those reserves by  during our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of potential losses on our accounts and notes receivables and is adjusted accordingly based on historical experience  current business levels  individual developments with certain licensees and economic trends 
although we believe we have adequate reserves for bad debts  we will continue to aggressively work to improve the long term viability of our dealer network and our actions could result in additional store closings in we also experienced a significant increase in our accounts payable balance during these were timing related inventory increases during november in preparation for our january new product introductions 
we expect both reduced inventory and accounts payable levels by the end of the first quarter of as noted on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet and statement of cash flows  we segregate property and equipment into two groups property and equipment utilized by our wholesale and retail segments  and retail real estate utilized by bfd licensees 
over the past three years we have continued to invest in our company owned retail stores and machinery  equipment and technology utilized by our wholesale segment in the amounts of   and  respectively 
a significant portion of our spending was related to the retrofitting of our charlotte store and the build out of the new atlanta store 
spending in associated with retail real estate utilized by bfd licensees consisted only of minor leasehold improvements 
both purchases of investments and proceeds from the sales of investments relate primarily to the active management of a portion of our overall investment portfolio 
during the year  marketable securities are bought and sold generating proceeds  purchases  gains and losses 
for  and net proceeds from sales of investments were   and  respectively  which were primarily used to fund operations and pay dividends 
dividends from an affiliate represent cash distributions from our investment in the international home furnishings center ihfc 
our investment in ihfc reflects a credit balance and is shown in the liabilities section of our balance sheet as distributions in excess of affiliate earnings 
based on current and expected future earnings of ihfc  we believe that the market value of this investment is positive and substantially greater than its current negative book value 
the financial statements of ihfc are included as an attachment to this form k 
we amended our existing revolving credit facility in october by extending the agreement by two years and amending certain covenants 
the credit facility provides for borrowings of up to  at a variable interest rate of libor plus on november  
the facility is secured by a pledge on certain marketable securities and substantially all of our receivables and inventories 
borrowings under the facility  which matures november   totaled  and  at november  and november   respectively 
after coverage for letters of credit and loan guarantees  we had  available for borrowing under the facility at november  this facility contains  among other provisions  certain defined financial requirements including a maximum ratio of debt to equity and a minimum level of net worth 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of november  as in previous years  we have paid per share in annual dividends representing an approximate annual cash requirement of  although we have experienced operating cash flow deficits in and  we plan for improved cash flow in  primarily due to a combination of improved operating performance and working capital management 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical dollars and are not intended to show the impact of inflation or changing prices 
neither inflation nor changing prices has had a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations in prior years 
we currently anticipate that total capital expenditures for fiscal will be approximately  most of which is intended for retrofits for the new prototype design primarily at company owned stores and information systems to support e commerce initiatives 
we have plans to continue to invest in store remodels  conversions  and new store real estate over the next three to four years and at potentially greater levels of up to  to  per year 
the funding for this retail growth could come from multiple sources  including our investment portfolio  our borrowing capacity  and or our expected cash flow from operations 
our capital expenditure and working capital requirements in the foreseeable future may change depending on many factors  including but not limited to our rate of growth  our operating results and any unplanned adjustments to our operating plan in response to economic  competitive or other circumstances 
we believe that our existing cash and investment portfolio  and our borrowing capacity  together with cash expected to be provided by operations  will be more than sufficient to meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

fin 
fin provides a comprehensive model for the recognition  measurement  presentation  and disclosure in a company s financial statements of uncertain tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on a tax return

additionally  companies are required to accrue interest and related penalties  if applicable  on all tax exposures consistent with the respective jurisdictional tax laws 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   our fiscal year ending november  we are currently in the process of inventorying and evaluating our uncertain tax positions to determine what impact fin will have on our results of operations or financial condition

contingencies we are involved in various claims and litigation as well as environmental matters  which arise in the normal course of business

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk for changes in market prices of our various types of investments 
our investments include marketable securities and an investment partnership alternative asset fund 
our marketable securities portfolio  which totaled  at november   is diversified among eleven different money managers and sixteen different medium to large capitalization equity interests 
although there are no maturity dates for our equity investments  we will liquidate these holdings as necessary to fund operations or other growth strategies 
maturity dates on other investments in the portfolio range from one to six years 
as part of our current debt facility  we have pledged certain of these securities as collateral 
the bassett industries alternative asset fund l 
p was organized under the delaware revised uniform limited partnership act and commenced operations on july  private advisors  llc is the general partner the general partner of the alternative asset fund 
we and the general partner are currently the only two partners 
the objective of the alternative asset fund is to achieve consistent positive returns  while attempting to reduce risk and volatility  by placing its capital with a variety of hedge funds and experienced portfolio managers 
such hedge funds and portfolio managers employ a variety of trading styles or strategies  including  but not limited to  convertible arbitrage  merger or risk arbitrage  distressed debt  long short equity  multi strategy and other market neutral strategies 
the general partner has discretion to make all investment and trading decisions  including the selection of investment managers 
the general partner selects portfolio managers on the basis of various criteria  including  among other things  the manager s investment performance during various time periods and market cycles  the fund s infrastructure  and the manager s reputation  experience  training and investment philosophy 
typically  the general partner requires that each portfolio manager have a substantial personal investment in the investment program 
our investment in the alternative asset fund  which totaled  at november   includes investments in various other private limited partnerships  which contain contractual commitments with elements of market risk 
these contractual commitments  which include fixed income securities and derivatives  may involve future settlements  which give rise to both market and credit risk 
the investment partnership s exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors  including the size  composition  and diversification of positions held  volatility of interest rates  market currency rates  and liquidity 
risks to these funds arise from possible adverse changes in the market value of such interests and the potential inability of counterparties to perform under the terms of the contracts 
however  the risk to the company is limited to the amount of the alternative asset fund investment in each of the funds 
we believe that the alternative asset fund did not hold any investments that have a material exposure  individually or in aggregate  to residential subprime loans either directly or through structured finance entities  such as collateralized debt obligations 
however  in the future  managers incorporating a multi strategy investing mandate may participate in these securities through their distressed portfolios if the risk return characteristics are deemed attractive 
we account for our investments by marking them to market value each month based on the net asset values provided by the general partner 
the hedge funds and portfolio managers provide the general partner with estimated net asset values on a monthly basis that represent the amount the partnership would receive if it were to liquidate its investments in the investee funds 
we are entitled to affect partial withdrawals from our capital account in the alternative asset fund at the end of any calendar quarter or any calendar year provided that bassett shall be subject to the withdrawal provisions and notice periods required by the underlying managers 
these notice periods range from days to six months and may be subject to lockup periods of up to one year
