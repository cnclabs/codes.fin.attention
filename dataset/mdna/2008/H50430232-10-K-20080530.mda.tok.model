we have also expanded into peripherals for other platforms  including video game consoles  mobile phones  home entertainment systems and mobile entertainment and digital music systems 
logitech s markets are extremely competitive and are characterized by short product life cycles  rapidly changing technology  evolving customer demands  and aggressive promotional and pricing practices 
in order to remain competitive  we believe continued investment in product research and development is critical to driving innovation with new and improved products and technologies 
we are committed to identifying and meeting customer needs for personal peripheral devices and believe innovation and product quality are important to gaining market acceptance and strengthening market leadership 
over the last several years  logitech has expanded and improved its supply chain operations  invested in product development and marketing  delivered innovative new products and pursued new market opportunities 
we have significantly broadened our product offerings and the markets in which we sell 
our expansion has been primarily organic  but we have also grown as a result of a limited number of acquisitions that expanded our business into new product categories 
in fiscal year  revenues increased to billion  with significant growth in most product categories  reflecting the strength and breadth of our product portfolio 
mice  keyboards and desktops  harmony remote controls and oem sales were key growth categories  while video declined compared with fiscal year we achieved strong gross margin improvements through our emphasis on product innovation  supply chain efficiencies and controlling and reducing our product cost structure 
net income was million  which included an investment write down of million and a gain on sale of investments of million  compared with net income of million in fiscal year our strategy for fiscal year remains to position logitech as a premium supplier in our product categories  offering affordable luxury to the consumer while continuing to compete aggressively in all market 
table of contents segments  from the entry level through the high end 
our focus will be on managing resources to create an innovative product portfolio targeted at current and future consumer trends as well as increasing the value of the logitech brand from a competitive  channel partner and consumer experience perspective 
we intend to take advantage of the significant opportunities in emerging markets  while leveraging the growth opportunities remaining in our mature markets 
in our pointing devices  keyboards and desktops product lines  we plan to continue our expansion into the notebook arena 
we also see significant opportunities for our mice and keyboards in the business market 
in the audio arena  we expect that our strong presence in the speaker category  combined with our proposed new products  will allow us to continue to generate growth 
we also plan to leverage the opportunities provided by our streaming media product line 
during fiscal year  we plan to build on the momentum achieved in our video product line in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and continue our focus on in store marketing  new products  and partnerships to generate a sustained return to growth 
we also expect our video security products to gain momentum throughout the next fiscal year

in our harmony remote control product line  we will continue to focus on improving every aspect of the user experience to increase our already high level of customer satisfaction and expand the universe of harmony users 
to support our planned growth  we intend to continue to scale our processes to handle the increased complexity of our product lines and improve the product life cycle management process 
we also plan to continue managing our operating expenses in line with our gross profit growth for the year 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap requires the company to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate critical if it i requires management to make judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain  and ii is important to an understanding of logitech s financial condition and operating results 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and actions that may impact the company in the future  actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe the following accounting estimates are most critical to our business operations and to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations  and reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accruals for customer programs we record accruals for product returns  cooperative marketing arrangements  customer incentive programs and price protection 
the estimated cost of these programs is accrued in the period the company sells the product or commits to the program as a reduction of revenue or as an operating expense  if we receive a separately identifiable benefit from the customer and can reasonably estimate the fair value of that benefit 
significant management judgment and estimates must be used to determine the cost of these programs in any accounting period 
returns 
the company grants limited rights to return product 
return rights vary by customer  and range from just the right to return defective product to the right to return a limited percentage of the previous quarter s 
table of contents purchases 
estimates of expected future product returns are recognized at the time of sale based on analyses of historical return trends by customer and by product  inventories owned by and located at distributors and retailers  current customer demand  current operating conditions  and other relevant customer and product information  such as stage of product life cycle 
return trends are influenced by the timing of the sale  the type of customer  operational policies and procedures  product sell through  product quality issues  sales levels  market acceptance of products  competitive pressures  new product introductions  product life cycle status  and other factors 
return rates can fluctuate over time  but are sufficiently predictable to allow us to estimate expected future product returns 
cooperative marketing arrangements 
the company s cooperative marketing arrangements include contractual customer marketing and sales incentive programs 
we enter into customer marketing programs with most of our distribution and retail customers allowing customers to receive a credit equal to a set percentage of their purchases of the company s products for various marketing programs 
the objective of these programs is to encourage advertising and promotional events to increase sales of our products 
accruals for the estimated costs of these marketing programs are recorded based on the contractual percentage of product purchased in the period we recognize revenue 
the company also offers rebates and discounts for certain types of sell through programs 
accruals for these sales incentive programs are recorded at the time of sale based on negotiated terms  historical experience and inventory levels in the channel 
customer incentive programs 
customer incentive programs include volume and consumer rebates 
we offer volume rebates to our distribution and retail customers related to purchase volumes or sales of specific products by distributors to specified retailers 
reserves for volume rebates are recognized as a reduction of the sale price at the time of sale 
estimates of required reserves are determined based on negotiated terms  consideration of historical experience  anticipated volume of future purchases  and inventory levels in the channel 
consumer rebates are offered from time to time at the company s discretion directly to end users 
estimated costs of consumer rebates and similar incentives are recorded at the time the incentive is offered  based on the specific terms and conditions 
certain incentive programs  including consumer rebates  require management to estimate the number of customers who will actually redeem the incentive based on historical experience and the specific terms and conditions of particular programs 
price protection 
we have contractual agreements with certain of our customers that contain terms allowing price protection credits to be issued in the event of a subsequent price reduction contractual price protection 
our decision to make price reductions is influenced by channel inventory levels  product life cycle stage  market acceptance of products  the competitive environment  new product introductions and other factors 
credits are issued for units that customers have on hand or in transit at the date of the price reduction 
reserves for the estimated amounts to be reimbursed to qualifying customers are established quarterly based on planned price reductions  analyses of qualified inventories on hand with distributors and retailers and historical trends by customer and by product 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our accruals for product returns  cooperative marketing arrangements  customer incentive programs and price protection 
future market conditions and product transitions may require the company to take action to increase such programs 
in addition  when the variables used to estimate these costs change  or if actual costs differ significantly from the estimates  we would be required to record incremental reductions to revenue or increase operating expenses 
if  at any future time  the company becomes unable to reasonably estimate these costs  recognition of revenue might be deferred until products are sold to end users  which would adversely impact revenue in the period of transition 
short term investments we have short term investments that are primarily auction rate securities and are classified as available for sale as of march  auction rate securities generally have maturity dates greater than years  with interest rates that typically reset through an auction every days 
the company s short term 
table of contents investments are reported at estimated fair value 
the fair value of short term investments is estimated based on quoted market prices  if available  or by estimating the values of the underlying collateral using published mortgage indices or interest rate spreads for comparably rated collateral and applying discounted cash flow or option pricing methods to the estimated collateral value 
the markets for the auction rate securities we hold as of march  have failed since august  and due to continuing dislocations in the worldwide credit markets  are not expected to resume in the foreseeable future  if at all 
as a result  the company has valued the remaining million in short term investments in its portfolio as of march  solely by pricing the underlying collateral using published mortgage indices or interest rate spreads for comparably rated collateral pools and applying discounted cash flow or option pricing methods to the estimated collateral value 
allowance for doubtful accounts we sell our products through a worldwide network of distributors  retailers and oem customers 
logitech generally does not require any collateral from its customers 
however  we seek to control our credit risk through ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts 
the allowances are based on management s assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts  including their credit worthiness and financial condition  as well as the company s historical experience with bad debts and customer deductions  receivables aging  current economic trends and geographic or country specific risks and the financial condition of its distribution channel 
as of march   two customers each represented of total accounts receivable 
the customers comprising the ten highest outstanding trade receivable balances accounted for approximately of total accounts receivable as of march  a deterioration of a significant customer s financial condition could cause actual write offs to be materially different from the estimated allowance 
if any of these customers receivable balances should be deemed uncollectible or if actual write offs are higher than historical experience  we would have to make adjustments to our allowance for doubtful accounts  which could result in an increase in the company s operating expenses 
inventory valuation the company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of customer orders 
further  our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand 
we record inventories at the lower of cost or market value and record write downs of inventories which are obsolete or in excess of anticipated demand or market value 
a review of inventory is performed each fiscal quarter that considers factors including the marketability and product life cycle stage  product development plans  component cost trends  demand forecasts and current sales levels 
we identify inventory exposures by comparing inventory on hand  in the channel and on order to historical and forecasted sales over six month periods 
inventory on hand which is not expected to be sold or utilized based on review of forecasted sales and utilization is considered excess  and we recognize the write off in cost of sales at the time of such determination 
at the time of loss recognition  a new  lower cost basis for that inventory is established and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances would not result in an increase in the cost basis 
if there were an abrupt and substantial decline in demand for logitech s products or an unanticipated change in technological or customer requirements  we may be required to record additional write downs which could adversely affect gross margins in the period when the write downs are recorded 
share based compensation expense we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payments sfas r  effective april   using the modified prospective 
table of contents transition method 
therefore  results for periods prior to april  have not been restated to include share based compensation expense calculated in accordance with sfas r 
share based compensation expense for fiscal years and includes compensation expense  reduced for estimated forfeitures  for awards granted after april  based on the grant date fair value estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing valuation model  recognized on a straight line basis over the service period of the award 
for share based compensation awards granted prior to but not yet vested as of april   share based compensation expense for fiscal years and was based on the grant date fair value estimated using the black scholes merton option pricing valuation model and reduced for estimated forfeitures recognized on a straight line basis over the service period for each separately vesting portion of the award 
see note employee benefit plans in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of share based compensation 
our estimates of share based compensation expense require a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns  future forfeitures  dividend yield  related tax effects and the selection of an appropriate fair value model 
we estimate expected share price volatility based on historical volatility using daily prices over the term of past options or purchase offerings  as we consider historical share price volatility as most representative of future stock option volatility 
we estimate expected life based on historical settlement rates  which we believe are most representative of future exercise and post vesting termination behaviors 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures  and we record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the company s history and future expectations of dividend payouts 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based compensation expense and related tax effects represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future from what we have recorded in the current period  which could materially affect our results of operations 
accounting for income taxes logitech operates in multiple jurisdictions and its profits are taxed pursuant to the tax laws of these jurisdictions 
the company s effective tax rate may be affected by the changes in or interpretations of tax laws in any given jurisdiction  utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  changes in geographical mix of income and expense  and changes in management s assessment of matters such as the ability to realize deferred tax assets 
as a result of these considerations  we must estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  considering all available evidence such as historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies 
we believe it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized  however  ultimate realization could be negatively impacted by market conditions and other variables not known or anticipated at this time 
in the event we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets  an adjustment would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized  the previously provided valuation allowance would be reversed 
we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin as of april   as required 
the implementation of the provisions of fin requires us to make certain estimates and judgments about the application of tax law  the expected resolution of uncertain tax positions and other matters 
in the event 
table of contents that uncertain tax positions are resolved for amounts different than our estimates  or the related statutes of limitations expire without the assessment of additional income taxes  we will be required to adjust the amounts of the related assets and liabilities in the period in which such events occur 
such adjustments may have a material impact on our income tax provision and our results of operations 
note of the consolidated financial statements describes fin and the effects on our results of operations and financial position arising from its adoption 
valuation of long lived assets we review long lived assets  such as investments  property  plant and equipment  and goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying amount of these assets might not be recoverable 
factors considered important which could require us to review an asset for impairment include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or the strategy for the company s overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and market capitalization relative to net book value 
recoverability of investments  property  plant and equipment  and other intangible assets is measured by comparing the projected undiscounted cash flows the asset is expected to generate with its carrying amount 
if an asset is considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable from our estimated future cash flows 
recoverability of goodwill is measured at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired  and a second test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
while the company has fully integrated all of its acquired companies  it continues to maintain discrete financial information for dconnexion and accordingly determines impairment for the goodwill acquired with the dconnexion acquisition at the entity level 
all other acquired goodwill is evaluated for impairment at a total enterprise level 
in determining fair value  we consider various factors including estimates of future market growth and trends  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods over which our assets will be utilized  and other variables 
we calculate the company s fair value based on the present value of projected cash flows using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate to the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
to date  we have not recognized any impairment of goodwill 
logitech bases its fair value estimates on assumptions it believes to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements

approximately of the company s sales were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar in fiscal year net sales growth benefited from the strengthening of the euro during fiscal year  however this benefit does not consider the impact that currency fluctuations had on our pricing strategy  which may result in selling prices in one currency being raised or lowered to avoid disparity with us dollar prices and to respond to currency driven competitive pricing actions 
retail pointing devices 
sales of our pointing devices increased and units increased during fiscal year compared with fiscal year the growth was led by sales of our cordless mice which increased during the year  with units increasing

sales of our pure fi anywhere speakers in the digital music category also contributed to the sales of our audio products 
retail video 
the company s video sales in dollars and units decreased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year  primarily due to slower than expected consumer demand in the webcam market  particularly in our emea region  where video sales decreased as compared with the prior fiscal year

retail sales in the emea region increased and units increased  led by sales of remotes  audio products  pointing devices  keyboards and desktops 
sales in the emea region have been disproportionately impacted by the decline in video sales  which decreased compared with the prior fiscal year 
modest sales growth in the emea region has hindered the company s overall sales growth for each of the four quarters of fiscal year the disparity between sales growth and unit growth in all regions was primarily due to product mix and currency fluctuations 
in particular  the strengthening of the euro in fiscal year positively impacted the sales growth in the emea region  however this benefit does not consider the impact that currency fluctuations have on the company s pricing strategy  which may result in selling prices in one currency being raised or lowered to avoid disparity with us dollar prices and to respond to currency driven competitive pricing actions 
oem 
our oem products achieved sales growth and unit growth during fiscal year compared with fiscal year oem sales of gaming peripherals increased significantly  driven by microphones for singing games for playstation  wii and xbox the company does not expect sales of microphones for singing games to be a primary driver of oem sales growth in the future

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
as a global concern  the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial results 
foreign currency exchange rates the company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as it transacts business in multiple foreign currencies  including exposure related to anticipated sales  anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
logitech transacts business in over currencies worldwide  of which the most significant to operations are the euro  chinese renminbi cny  british pound sterling  japanese yen  taiwanese dollar  canadian dollar and mexican peso 
the functional currency of the company s operations is primarily the us dollar 
to a lesser extent  certain operations use the euro  swiss 
table of contents franc  japanese yen or the local currency of the country as their functional currencies 
accordingly  unrealized foreign currency gains or losses resulting from the translation of net assets or liabilities denominated in foreign currencies to the us dollar are accumulated in the cumulative translation adjustment component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity

the company s principal manufacturing operations are located in china  with much of its component and raw material costs transacted in cny 
however  the functional currency of its chinese operating subsidiary is the us dollar as its sales and trade receivables are transacted in us dollars 
to hedge against any potential significant appreciation of the cny  the company transferred a portion of its cash investments to cny accounts 
at march   net assets held in cny totaled million 
the company continues to evaluate the level of net assets held in cny relative to component and raw material purchases and interest rates on cash equivalents 
from time to time  the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce the short term effects of foreign currency fluctuations on certain foreign currency receivables or payables and to provide against exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates related to subsidiaries forecasted inventory purchases 
these forward contracts generally mature within one to three months 
the company may also enter into foreign exchange swap contracts to extend the terms of its foreign exchange forward contracts 
gains or losses in fair value on forward contracts which offset translation losses or gains on foreign currency receivables or payables are recognized in earnings monthly and are included in other income expense 
gains or losses in fair value on forward contracts related to forecasted inventory purchases are also recognized in earnings monthly and are included in cost of goods sold 
the notional amounts of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding at march  were million 
the notional amounts of foreign exchange swap contracts outstanding at march  were million 
unrealized net losses on the contracts at march  were not material 

table of contents if the us dollar had appreciated by compared with the hedged foreign currency  an unrealized gain of million in our forward foreign exchange contract portfolio would have occurred 
if the us dollar had depreciated by compared with the hedged foreign currency  a million unrealized loss in our forward foreign exchange contract portfolio would have occurred 
interest rates changes in interest rates could impact the company s anticipated interest income on its cash equivalents and short term investments and interest expense on variable rate short term debt 
the company prepared sensitivity analyses of its interest rate exposures to assess the impact of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
based on the results of these analyses  a basis point decrease or increase in interest rates from the march  and march  period end rates would not have a material effect on the company s results of operations or cash flows
