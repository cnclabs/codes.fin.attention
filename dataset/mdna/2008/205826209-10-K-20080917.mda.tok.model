risk factors forward looking statements this form k contains forward looking statements including statements concerning the future of our industry  product development  business strategy  continued acceptance of our products  market growth  and dependence on significant customers 
these statements can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  expect  anticipate  estimate  continue  or other similar words 
when considering forward looking statements  you should keep in mind the risk factors and other cautionary statements in this form k 
however  the risks described in this form k are not the only risks that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties  not currently known to us or that do not currently appear to be material  may also materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and or operating results in the future 
the risk factors noted below and other factors noted throughout this form k could cause our actual financial condition or results to differ significantly from those contained in any forward looking statement 
our recent acquisition of radyne corporation radyne may not be successful and we may not realize anticipated benefits from this acquisition 
the radyne acquisition may divert our resources and management attention and our operating results may fall short of expectations 
on august  the beginning of our fiscal year  we purchased radyne using a portion of our existing cash and cash equivalents for a preliminary aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
although we expect to realize strategic  operational and financial benefits as a result of the radyne acquisition  we cannot assure whether and to what extent such benefits will be achieved 
in particular  the success of the radyne acquisition will depend  in part  on our ability to realize anticipated efficiencies and cost savings  primarily through the elimination of redundant functions and the integration of certain operations 
no assurances can be given that we will be able to achieve these efficiencies and cost savings 
radyne has a history of inconsistent operating results and missing expectations and we will face operational and administrative challenges as we work to integrate radyne s operations into our business 
in particular  the radyne acquisition has significantly expanded the types of products that we sell  expanded the businesses with which we are engaged in  as well as increased the number of our employees and the number of facilities we operate  thereby presenting us with significant challenges as we will need to manage the substantial increase in scale resulting from the acquisition 
we must integrate a large number of systems  both operational and administrative 
delays in the process could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
ultimately  we may not be successful 
the diversion of our management s attention to these matters and away from other business concerns could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results may fall short of expectations 
future acquisitions and strategic investments may divert our resources and management attention  results may fall short of expectations and  as a result  our operating results may be difficult to forecast and may be volatile 
we intend to continue pursuing acquisitions of investments in businesses  technologies and product lines as a key component of our growth strategy 
any future acquisitions or investments may result in the use of significant amounts of cash  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of debt and amortization expenses or in process research and development charges related to intangibles assets 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the integration of the operations  technologies  products and personnel of an acquired business  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  increased expenses associated with the acquisition  and loss of key employees or customers of any acquired business 
we cannot assure you that our future acquisitions will be successful and will not adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
due to many factors  including the radyne acquisition and the amount of business represented by large contracts  our operating results are difficult to forecast and may be volatile 
we have experienced  and will experience in the future  significant fluctuations in new orders  net sales and operating results  including our net income and earnings per share  from quarter to quarter 
one reason for this is that a significant portion of our business primarily the over the horizon microwave systems of our telecommunications transmission segment  our rf microwave amplifiers segment and our mobile data communications segment is derived from a limited number of relatively large customer contracts  the timing of which cannot be predicted 
our new orders  net sales and operating results  including our net income and earnings per share  also may vary significantly from period to period because of the following factors the financial performance of acquisitions  product mix sold  fluctuating market demand  price competition  new product introductions by our competitors  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  unexpected changes in delivery of components or subsystems  political instability  regulatory developments  changes in income tax rates or tax credits  the price and expected volatility of our stock which will impact  among other items  the amount of stock based compensation expense we may record  and general economic conditions 
in addition  on august   as a result of our acquisition of radyne there will be a significant change to our future financial performance 
accordingly  you should not rely on period to period comparisons as indications of our future performance because these comparisons may not be meaningful 
our business  results of operations  liquidity and financial condition depend on our ability to maintain our level of us government business 
in recent years  we have increased our dependence on us government business 
our sales to the us government including sales to prime contractors to the us government accounted for approximately  and of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 
approximately of our backlog at july  consisted of orders from the us government 
radyne s business and net sales were also significantly dependent on the business it received from the us government 
we expect such business to represent a significant portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future 
us government business exposes us to various risks  including unexpected contract or project terminations or suspensions  unpredictable order placements  reductions or cancellations  reductions in government funds available for our projects due to government policy changes  budget cuts and other spending priorities  penalties arising from post award contract audits  cost audits in which the value of our contracts may be reduced  higher than expected final costs  particularly relating to software and hardware development  for work performed under contracts where we commit to specified deliveries for a fixed price  and unpredictable cash collections of unbilled receivables that may be subject to acceptance of contract deliverables by the customer and contract close out procedures  including government approval of final indirect rates 
all of our us government contracts can be terminated by the us government for its convenience 
termination for convenience provisions provide only for our recovery of costs incurred or committed  settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to termination 
in addition to the right of the us government to terminate  us government contracts are conditioned upon the continuing approval by congress of the necessary spending 
congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a fiscal year basis even though contract performance may take more than one year 
consequently  at the beginning of a major program  the contract may not be fully funded  and additional monies are normally committed to the contract only if  and when  appropriations are made by congress for future fiscal years 
we obtain us government contracts through a competitive bidding process 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to win competitively awarded contracts or that awarded contracts will generate sufficient net sales to result in profitability 
if we are unable to comply with complex us government regulations governing security and contracting practices  we could be disqualified as a supplier to the u 
s government 
as a supplier to the us government  we must comply with numerous regulations  including those governing security and contracting practices 
failure to comply with these procurement regulations and practices could result in fines being imposed against us or our suspension for a period of time from eligibility for bidding on  or for award of  new government contracts 
if we are disqualified as a supplier to government agencies  we would lose most  if not all  of our us government customers and revenues from sales of our products would decline significantly 
among the potential causes for disqualification are violations of various statutes  including those related to procurement integrity  export control  us government security regulations  employment practices  protection of the environment  accuracy of records in the recording of costs  and foreign corruption 
the government could investigate and make inquiries of our business practices and conduct audits of contract performance and cost accounting 
based on the results of such audits  the us government could adjust our contract related costs and fees 
depending on the results of these audits and investigations  the government could make claims against us  and if it were to prevail  certain incurred costs would not be recoverable by us 
we could be adversely affected by the results of ongoing investigations into our compliance with export regulations 
in october  our florida based subsidiary  comtech systems  inc csi  received a customs export enforcement subpoena from the us immigration and customs enforcement ice branch of the department of homeland security 
the subpoena relates to csi s million contract with the brazilian naval commission the brazil contract and it required the production of all books  records and documents  including copies of contracts  invoices and payments related to agreements between csi  its agent  its subcontractor and the brazilian government 
we believe that the ice investigation is focused primarily on whether or not csi was in compliance with export related laws and regulations  including the international traffic in arms regulations itar and the export administration regulations 
csi produced documents in response to the subpoena request 
customs officials have detained certain inventory related to the brazil contract pending resolution of this matter 
we engaged outside counsel to assist csi in its response to the subpoena and related matters and to conduct our own investigation 
based on our ongoing investigation into this matter  we believe that the detained inventory  which consists of commercial satellite equipment  was not modified or adapted in any way to meet brazilian military requirements and was only subject to the jurisdiction of the department of commerce and not the jurisdiction of the us department of state 
in addition  in order to provide certain defense services  including conducting factory acceptance testing at csi s florida facility  we obtained a license referred to as a technical assistance agreement taa from the us department of state 
we believe that the taa authorized all activities under the brazil contract that were subject to the jurisdiction of the us department of state 
we believe that csi made a good faith effort to comply with applicable regulations  however  we believe that csi made inadvertent administrative errors resulting in a taa that did not become effective on a timely basis 
the administrative errors relate primarily to the execution of non disclosure agreements nda with certain third country national employees of csi s agent 
these individuals have now signed appropriate ndas  and  in december  csi filed an amended taa with the us department of state 
csi has requested that the us department of state confirm csi s and our view that the brazil contract does not require any other state department license 
in march  the enforcement division of the us department of state informed us that they were reviewing our amended taa 
in may  the us attorney s office in the middle district of florida informed us that  based on its conversations with the ice agent who initiated the subpoena  it was closing its investigation into the brazil matter 
in june  the ice agent informed us that he would recommend that the detained inventory be released back to us upon the us department of state confirming our position that a state department license for the hardware shipped was not required 
in august  the ice agent informed us that the us department of state wanted to clarify certain technical matters and  on its behalf  the ice agent was going to interview one of our engineers 
this interview occurred in september of we continue to remain cautiously optimistic that we will be able to shortly reship the brazil inventory to our customer 
in addition to their review of the brazil contract  in march  the enforcement division of the us department of state informed us that they sought to confirm our company wide itar compliance for the five year period ended march in response  we expanded the scope of our own investigation 
in june  we provided detailed information and a summary of our findings to the us department of state 
in july  the us department of state requested supplemental information and we responded to their request 
our findings to date indicate that there were certain instances of exports and defense services during the five year period for which we did not have the appropriate authorization from the us department of state  however  none of those instances involved proscribed countries as defined by itar 
we are awaiting additional feedback from the us department of state as it relates to all of the aforementioned matters 
since the receipt of the original brazil subpoena in october  we have engaged outside counsel and export consultants to help us assess and improve  as appropriate  our internal controls with respect to us export controls laws and regulations and laws governing record keeping and dealings with foreign representatives 
in addition  in connection with our august  acquisition of radyne  we are expanding our export internal control assessment to include our newly acquired subsidiaries 
to date  we have noted opportunities for improving our procedures to comply with such laws and regulations  including at our newly acquired radyne subsidiaries and are in the process of making improvements 
during fiscal  we have taken numerous steps to significantly improve our export control processes  including the hiring of additional employees who are knowledgeable and experienced with itar and the engagement of an outside export consultant to conduct additional training 
we are also in the process of implementing enhanced formal company wide itar control procedures  including at our newly acquired radyne subsidiaries 
because our assessments are continuing  we expect to remediate  improve and enhance our internal controls relating to exports throughout fiscal because the above matters are ongoing  we cannot determine the ultimate outcome of these matters 
violations of us export control related laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal fines and or penalties and or result in an injunction against us  all of which could  in the aggregate  materially impact our business  results of operations and cash flows 
should we identify a material weakness relating to our compliance  the ongoing costs of remediation could be material 
in addition  inventory related to the brazil contract including the inventory that has been detained had a net book value of million as of july  if this inventory is permanently seized or not returned to us timely  or we can not resell the inventory to other customers  we would be required to write off the value of this inventory in a future accounting period 
our dependence on international sales and international sales agents may adversely affect us 
us export laws may also restrict our ability to sell our products abroad which reduces our ability to obtain sales from foreign customers 
sales for use by international customers including sales to us domestic companies for inclusion in products that will be sold to international customers represented approximately  and of our consolidated net sales for the fiscal years ended july   and  respectively 
approximately of our backlog at july  consisted of orders for use by foreign customers 
we expect that international sales including sales from radyne will continue to be a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales 
these sales expose us to certain risks  including barriers to trade  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which may make our products less price competitive  political and economic instability  exposure to public health epidemics  availability of suitable export financing  tariff regulations  and other us and foreign regulations that may apply to the export of our products and the generally greater difficulties of doing business abroad 
we attempt to reduce the risk of doing business in foreign countries by seeking subcontracts with large systems suppliers  contracts denominated in us dollars  advance or milestone payments and irrevocable letters of credit in our favor 
however  we may not be able to reduce the economic risk of doing business in foreign countries  in all instances 
in such cases  billed and unbilled receivables relating to international sales are subject to increased collectibility risk and may result in significant write offs  which could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  foreign defense contracts generally contain provisions relating to termination at the convenience of the government 
in some countries  we may rely upon one international sales agent 
we attempt to reduce our reliance on sales agents by establishing additional foreign sales offices and by engaging  where practicable  more than one independent sales representative in a territory 
certain of our products and systems may require licenses from us government agencies for export from the us  and some of our products are not permitted to be exported 
in addition  in certain cases  us export controls also severely limit unlicensed technical discussions such as with any persons who are not us citizens or permanent residents 
as a result  in cases where we may need a license  it may reduce our ability to compete against a non us domiciled foreign company who may not be subject to the same us laws 
we cannot be sure of our ability to gain any licenses that may be required to export our products  and failure to receive required licenses could materially reduce our ability to sell our products outside the us we have significant operations in florida and california  and other locations  which could be materially and adversely impacted  in the event of a natural disaster or other significant disruption 
our telecommunications transmission segment designs and manufactures our over the horizon microwave equipment and systems out of two facilities located in florida  where major hurricanes have occurred in the past 
as of august   our rf microwave amplifiers segment manufactures and designs traveling wave tube amplifier and klystron amplifiers in santa clara  california  close to major earthquake fault lines 
our operations in these and other locations such as in our high volume technology manufacturing center located in tempe  arizona and our mobile data communication segment s network operations center located in germantown  maryland  could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions  including hurricanes  typhoons  tsunamis  floods  earthquakes  fires  water shortages  other extreme weather conditions  medical epidemics  acts of terrorism  power shortages and blackouts  telecommunications failures  and other natural and manmade disasters or disruptions 
in the event of such a natural disaster or other disruption  we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers  distributors  resellers or customers  destruction of facilities  and or loss of life  all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses and materially adversely affect our business  revenue and financial condition 
all of our businesses are subject to rapid technological change  we rely upon licensed technology for some of our products and we must keep pace with changes to compete successfully 
we are engaged in businesses characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  frequent new product announcements and enhancements  and changing customer demands 
the introduction of products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render any of our products and services obsolete or non competitive 
the technology used in our products and services evolves rapidly  and our business position depends  in large part  on the continuous refinement of our scientific and engineering expertise and the development  either through internal research and development or acquisitions  of new or enhanced products and technologies 
we may not have the economic or technological resources to be successful in such efforts and we may not be able to identify and respond to technological improvements made by our competitors in a timely or cost effective fashion 
our doubletalk carrier in carrier bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party 
a significant technological breakthrough by others  including smaller competitors or new firms  could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
reductions in telecommunications equipment and systems spending may negatively affect our revenues  profitability and the recoverability of our assets  including intangible assets 
for the last several years  the us and global economies have been growing and our revenues and profits have increased as our customers have increased their spending on telecommunications equipment and systems 
however  during fiscal  adverse conditions in the us consumer mortgage market have negatively impacted the global economy and nearly all businesses  including ours  are facing uncertain economic environments 
some economists are now predicting a recession 
our businesses have been negatively affected in the past by uncertain economic environments both in the overall market  and more specifically in the telecommunications sector 
as a result of the current global economic conditions  our customers may reduce their budgets for spending on telecommunications equipment and systems 
as a consequence  our current customers and other prospective customers may postpone  reduce or even forego the purchase of our products and systems  which could adversely affect our revenues  profitability and the recoverability of our assets  including intangible assets 
although we remain confident that the long term demand drivers for our businesses  including our satellite earth station products  remain strong  it is currently difficult to assess whether or not future bookings will meet or exceed the levels experienced in fiscal our mobile data communications business is subject to unique risks 
our mobile data communications business segment is reliant upon just a few contracts 
in addition to the other risk factors described in this section  the risk factors applicable to our mobile data communications business include the following our mobile data communications segment s revenues and profits are primarily derived from the movement tracking systems mts contract and the us army s force xxi battle command  brigade and below command and control systems also known as blue force tracking bft contract 
both of these contracts can be terminated at any time and orders are subject to unpredictable funding  deployment and technology decisions by the us government 
because both of these contracts are indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts  the us army is not obligated to purchase any equipment or services under the contracts 
our mts and bft contracts are not subject to automatic renewal or extension upon their scheduled expiration on july  and december   respectively 
in addition  the us army may decide to award future orders  at any time  to other parties 
if another party is awarded future orders or if one or both of our contracts are not renewed  extended or if we fail to succeed in a recompete process  it would have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
in fiscal  the bft program s prime contractor  northrop grumman corporation  awarded a contract to a competitor to develop a new prototype network and related equipment to increase network capacity for the us army s bft tracking system 
although we are currently working closely with the us army to provide additional enhancements to our network capabilities and communications performance and believe that we have and are developing new products that provide compelling technological advancement to our existing products and that are  importantly  backwards compatible with the large number of existing bft and mts systems in active deployment today  it is possible that the us army including our mts customers will ultimately cease or reduce its ordering levels of our products and services 
if this occurs  it would have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
we currently anticipate that we will continue to maintain a substantial inventory in order to provide products to our customers on a timely basis 
certain components required in our production process have purchasing lead times of four months or longer  and the delivery timetables on our contracts require us to provide products in shorter timeframes after we receive an order 
if forecasted orders are not received  we may be left with large inventories of slow moving or unusable parts or terminals that would result in an adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we lease the satellite capacity necessary to operate our system from a limited number of third party satellite networks 
our ability to grow and remain profitable depends on the ability of our satellite network providers to provide sufficient network capacity  reliability and security to our customers 
if our satellite network providers were to increase the prices of their services  or to suffer operational or technical failures  our business  results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our systems occasionally experience downtime 
all satellite communications are subject to the risk that a satellite or ground station failure or a natural disaster may interrupt service 
interruptions in service could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
should we be required to restore service on another system in the event of a satellite failure  our costs could increase which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
to date  commercial satellite based mobile data applications have not been a material part of our business 
in addition  we do not have extensive experience designing  manufacturing or selling microsatellites and related components 
our future success in developing these markets will depend on  among other things  our ability to access the best distribution channels  the development or licensing of applications which create value for the customer and our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
we may have to increase our operating expenses to be successful in these markets 
there are several existing and potential commercial and defense related competitors  such as qualcomm  inc and northrop grumman corporation  that participate in the mobile data communications market and who have much greater financial resources than us 
existing competitors  including terrestrial based service providers  are also aggressively pricing their products and services and may continue to do so in the future 
competitors such as viasat  inc and harris corporation continue to offer new value added products and services  which we may be unable to match on a timely or cost effective basis 
companies  such as surrey satellite technology  ltd 
and microsat systems  inc  compete against us in the microsatellite and related components markets 
increased competition may adversely impact margins throughout the industry 
we anticipate that new competitors will also enter the mobile data communications market in the future 
this could adversely impact our existing business  results of operations and financial condition and could also impair our ability to penetrate the commercial market in a significant way 
our backlog is subject to customer cancellation or modification and such cancellation could result in decreased sales and increased provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
we currently have a backlog of orders  mostly under contracts that the customer may modify or terminate 
almost all of the contracts in our backlog are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the customer or for default in the event that we are unable to perform under the contract 
we cannot assure you that our backlog will result in net sales 
we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends and other factors including the consideration of the amount of backlog we have on hand at any particular point in time 
if our backlog is canceled or modified  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if we determine that our inventory is overvalued  we will be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination 
any such charges could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
our dependence on component availability  government furnished equipment  subcontractor availability and performance and key suppliers  including the core manufacturing expertise of our high volume technology manufacturing center located in tempe  arizona  may adversely affect us 
although we obtain certain components and subsystems from a single source or a limited number of sources  we believe that most components and subsystems are available from alternative suppliers and subcontractors 
a significant interruption in the delivery of such items  however  could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in recent years  we have increased the company wide dependency on our high volume technology manufacturing center located in tempe  arizona  which is part of our telecommunications transmission segment 
in fiscal  and  intersegment sales by the telecommunications transmission segment to the mobile data communications segment were million  million and million  respectively 
intersegment sales in fiscal  and by the telecommunications transmission segment to the rf microwave amplifiers segment were million  million and million  respectively 
if a natural disaster or other business interruption occurred  we do not have immediate access to other manufacturing facilities  and as a result  our business would suffer 
in addition  if our high volume technology manufacturing center is unable to produce sufficient product or maintain quality  it could have a material adverse impact on all three of our business segments  our results of operations and our financial condition 
we intend to continue to increase our company wide dependency on our high volume technology manufacturing center 
for example  the success of the radyne acquisition will depend  in part  on our ability to realize anticipated efficiencies and cost savings  primarily through the result of closing radyne s phoenix  arizona  manufacturing facility and integrating that operation into our tempe  arizona facility 
we also intend to continue to seek contracts with third parties to outsource a portion of their manufacturing to us 
no assurances can be given that we will be able to achieve these efficiencies and cost savings 
in the past  the us government experienced delays in the receipt of certain components that are ultimately provided to us for incorporation into our satellite transceivers that we ship to the us government 
if we do not receive these government furnished components in a timely manner  we could experience delays in fulfilling orders from our customers 
contract cost growth on our fixed price contracts and other contracts that cannot be justified as an increase in contract value due from customers exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business and other risks 
a substantial portion of our products and services are sold under fixed price contracts 
this means that we bear the risk of unanticipated technological  manufacturing  supply or other problems  price increases or other increases in the cost of performance 
operating margin is adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to the customer are incurred 
this cost growth can occur if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect  or if estimates to complete increase 
the cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise 
reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance  availability and timing of funding from the customer  natural disasters  and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more programs could have a material impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
adverse regulatory changes could impair our ability to sell products 
our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that must comply with various us government regulations  including those of the fcc  as well as international laws and regulations 
regulatory changes  including changes in the allocation and availability of frequency spectrum  and in the military standards and specifications that define the current satellite networking environment  could materially harm our business by i restricting development efforts by us and our customers  ii making our current products less attractive or obsolete  or iii increasing the opportunity for additional competition 
changes in  or our failure to comply with  applicable laws and regulations could materially harm our business 
in addition  the increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards and reassign bandwidth for these products and services 
the reduced number of available frequencies for other products and services and the time delays inherent in the government approval process of new products and services have caused and may continue to cause our customers to cancel  postpone or reschedule their installation of communications systems including their satellite  over the horizon microwave  or terrestrial line of sight microwave communication systems 
this  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our sales of products to our customers 
the eu has adopted two directives to facilitate the recycling of electrical and electronic equipment sold in the eu 
the first of these is the waste from electrical and electronic equipment directive  which directs eu member states to enact laws  regulations  and administrative provisions to ensure that producers of electrical and electronic equipment are financially responsible for the collection  recycling  treatment  and environmentally sound disposal of certain products placed on the market after august   and from products in use prior to that date that are being replaced 
the eu has also adopted the restriction on the use of certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs directive 
the rohs directive restricts the use of lead  mercury  and certain other substances in electrical and electronic products placed on the market in the eu after july  similar laws and regulations have been or may be enacted in other regions  including in the us  china and japan 
other environmental regulations may require us to reengineer our products to utilize components that are more environmentally compatible  and such reengineering and component substitution may result in additional costs to us 
there can be no assurance that such existing or future laws will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
our investments in recorded goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of prior acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our radyne acquisition could be impaired as a result of future business conditions  requiring us to record substantial write downs that would reduce our operating income 
we have goodwill and intangible assets of million recorded on our balance sheet as of july  this amount will materially increase as a result of the radyne acquisition 
we evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts and intangible assets annually  or when evidence of potential impairment exists 
the annual impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment 
changes in our operating performance or business conditions  in general  could result in an impairment of goodwill which could be material to our results of operations 
in addition  if we are not successful in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies associated with the radyne acquisition  our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired 
the loss of key technical or management personnel could adversely affect our business 
our success depends on the continued contributions of key technical management personnel  including the key corporate and operating unit management at each of our subsidiaries 
many of our key personnel  particularly the key engineers of our subsidiaries  would be difficult to replace  and are not subject to employment or noncompetition agreements 
our growth and future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineering  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel from other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations is intense 
although we believe that we have been successful to date in recruiting and keeping key personnel  we may not be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel we will need to continue to grow and operate profitably 
also  the management skills that have been appropriate for us in the past may not continue to be appropriate if we continue to grow and diversify 
our business and operating results may be negatively impacted if we are unable to continue to manage growth of our businesses 
certain of our businesses have experienced periods of rapid growth that have placed  and may continue to place  significant demands on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
in addition to anticipated organic growth  our revenues are expected to significantly increase in fiscal as a result of the radyne acquisition 
in order to manage this growth  we must continue to improve and expand our management  operational and financial systems and controls 
we also need to continue to recruit and retain personnel and train and manage our employee base 
we must carefully manage research and development capabilities and production and inventory levels to meet product demand  new product introductions and product and technology transitions 
if we are not able to timely and effectively manage our growth and maintain the quality standards required by our existing and potential customers  we could experience a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our markets are highly competitive 
the markets for our products are highly competitive 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully compete or that our competitors will not develop new technologies and products that are more effective than our own 
we expect the dod s increased use of commercial off the shelf products and components in military equipment will encourage new competitors to enter the market 
also  although the implementation of advanced telecommunications services is in its early stages in many developing countries  we believe competition may intensify as businesses and foreign governments realize the market potential of telecommunications services 
many of our competitors have financial  technical  marketing  sales and distribution resources greater than ours 
protection of our intellectual property is limited  we are subject to the risk of third party claims of infringement 
our doubletalk carrier in carrier bandwidth compression technology is licensed by us from a third party 
our businesses rely in large part upon our proprietary scientific and engineering know how and production techniques 
historically  patents have not been an important part of our protection of our intellectual property rights 
we rely upon the laws of unfair competition  restrictions in licensing agreements and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property 
we limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
these efforts allow us to rely upon the knowledge and experience of our management and technical personnel to market our existing products and to develop new products 
the departure of any of our key management and technical personnel  the breach of their confidentiality and non disclosure obligations to us or the failure to achieve our intellectual property objectives may have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our ability to compete successfully and achieve future revenue growth will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and operate without infringing upon the rights of others 
we may fail to do so 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us we believe that we own or have licensed all intellectual property rights necessary for the operation of our businesses as currently contemplated 
if the technology we use is found to infringe on protected technology  we could be required to change our business practices  license the protected technology  and or pay damages or other compensation to the infringed party 
if we are unable to license protected technology that we use in our business or if we are required to change our business practices  we could be prohibited from making and selling our products or providing certain telecommunications services 
our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations and we may be subject to environmental liabilities 
we engage in manufacturing and are subject to a variety of local  state and federal governmental regulations relating to the storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used to manufacture our products  such as the fabrication of fiberglass antennas by our comtech antenna systems  inc subsidiary 
we are also subject to the rohs directive which restricts the use of lead  mercury and other substances in electrical and electronic products 
the failure to comply with current or future environmental requirements could result in the imposition of substantial fines  suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of operations that could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  the handling  treatment or disposal of hazardous substances by us or our predecessors may have resulted  or could in the future result  in contamination requiring investigation or remediation  or leading to other liabilities  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our fiscal and fiscal federal income tax returns were recently audited by the internal revenue service and our fiscal tax return has been selected for audit 
other returns may be selected for audit in the future 
although adjustments relating to our fiscal and fiscal tax return were immaterial  a resulting tax assessment or settlement for fiscal and other periods that may be selected for future audit could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we are subject to income taxes in both the us and certain foreign jurisdictions  including canada 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax examinations and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 
recently enacted securities laws and regulations are increasing our costs and possible future changes to financial reporting standards may result in incremental costs 
the sarbanes oxley act of required changes in some of our corporate governance  public disclosure and compliance practices 
these changes resulted in increased costs and as we grow  we expect to see our costs increase 
the sec has promulgated and proposed new rules on a variety of subjects including the possibility that we would be required to adopt international financial reporting standards ifrs 
if we are required to change our financial reporting standards and policies to comply with ifrs  our costs could significantly increase 
in addition  the nasdaq stock market llc nasdaq has revised its requirements for companies  such as us  that are listed on the nasdaq 
these changes are increasing our legal and financial compliance costs including making it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance or maintain our current liability coverage 
we believe that these new and proposed laws and regulations could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee  and qualified executive officers 
we are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of identification of material weaknesses in internal controls including those at our newly acquired subsidiaries at radyne  if identified  could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of and related sec rules  we are required to furnish a report of management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls as part of our annual report on form k 
our independent registered accountants are required to attest to and report on management s assessment  as well as provide a separate opinion 
to issue our report  we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion  and then we test and evaluate the results 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses  if any  that may be identified in future periods  or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance 
there likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel  especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies 
changes in financial accounting standards related to stock based awards are expected to continue to have a significant effect on our reported results 
in fiscal  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  a revised standard that requires that we record compensation expense in the statement of operations for employee and director stock based awards using a fair value method 
the adoption of the new standard had a significant effect on our reported earnings  and could adversely impact our ability to provide accurate guidance on our future reported financial results due to the variability of the factors used to estimate the value of stock based awards 
as a result  the ongoing application of this standard could impact the future value of our common stock and may result in greater stock price volatility 
in addition  since our inception  we have used stock based awards as a fundamental component of our employee compensation packages 
we believe that stock based awards directly motivate our employees to maximize long term stockholder value and  through the use of long term vesting  encourage employees to remain with us 
to the extent that this accounting standard makes it less attractive to grant stock based awards to employees  we may incur increased compensation costs  change our equity compensation strategy or find it difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees  each of which could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face risks from the uncertainty of prevailing political conditions 
current global political conditions are uncertain 
for example  the winner of the november us presidential election could significantly change policies or priorities which could have a negative impact on our business 
because the accuracy of our budgeting and forecasting process relies on stable political conditions  the prevailing political environment renders estimates of future income and expenses even more difficult than usual to formulate 
the future direction of the political environment could have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
terrorist attacks and threats  and government responses thereto  and threats of war elsewhere may negatively impact all aspects of our operations  revenues  costs and stock price 
terrorist attacks  the us government s and other governments responses thereto  and threats of war could adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
any escalation in these events or similar or future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers and may affect the availability of materials needed to manufacture our products or the means to transport those materials to manufacturing facilities and finished products to customers 
in addition  these could have an adverse impact on the us and world economy in general 
provisions in our corporate documents  stockholder rights plan  and delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of comtech 
we have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition involving comtech that our stockholders may consider favorable 
for example  we have a classified board and the employment contract with our chief executive officer and contracts with other of our executive officers provide for substantial payments in certain circumstances or in the event of a change of control of comtech 
we also adopted a stockholder rights plan that could cause substantial dilution to a stockholder  and substantially increase the cost paid by a stockholder  who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
these provisions could prevent us from being acquired 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation grants our board of directors the authority to fix the rights  preferences and privileges of and issue up to  shares of preferred stock without stockholder action 
although we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock  such an issuance of any class or series of our preferred stock could have rights which would adversely affect the voting power of the common stock or which could delay  defer  or prevent a change in control of comtech 
in addition  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  an anti takeover law 
in general  this statute provides that except in certain limited circumstances a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
a business combination includes mergers  asset sales and other transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder 
subject to certain exceptions  for purposes of section of the delaware general corporation law  an interested stockholder is a person who  together with affiliates  owns  or within three years did own  or more of the corporation s voting stock 
this provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of comtech 
our debt service obligations may adversely affect our cash flow 
the higher level of indebtedness resulting from the issuance of our convertible senior notes increases the risk that we may default on our debt obligations 
our convertible senior notes  may  at our option  be redeemable for cash on or after february  holders of our convertible senior notes have the right to require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding convertible senior notes on february   february  and february   and upon certain events  including a change in control 
should we decide to redeem some or all of the outstanding convertible senior notes  or if the holders of our convertible senior notes require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding convertible senior notes  we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the interest on our debt or that future working capital  borrowings or equity financing will be available to pay or refinance such debt 
the level of our indebtedness  among other things  could make it difficult for us to make payments on our debt  make it difficult for us to obtain any necessary financing in the future for working capital  acquisitions  capital expenditures  debt service requirements or other purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business 
our stock price is volatile 
the stock market in general  and the stock prices of technology based companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future as well 
factors that could have a significant impact on the market price of our stock are described throughout the risk factors section and include strategic transactions  such as acquisitions and divestures  issuance of potentially dilutive equity type securities future announcements concerning us or our competitors  receipt or non receipt of substantial orders for products and services  quality deficiencies in services or products  results of technological innovations  new commercial products  changes in recommendations of securities analysts  government regulations  proprietary rights or product or patent litigation  changes in economic conditions generally  particularly in the telecommunications sector  changes in securities market conditions  generally  energy blackouts  acts of terrorism or war  inflation or deflation  and rumors or allegations regarding our financial disclosures or practices 
shortfalls in our sales or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately  significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock

unresolved staff comments none 
item properties historically  we have not owned any material properties and facilities and have relied upon a strategy of leasing 
our properties and facilities including radyne facilities are noted below our corporate headquarters are located in an office building complex in melville  new york 
the lease  which is for  square feet  provides for our use of the premises for seven years through july our rf microwave amplifiers segment manufactures our solid state  high power  broadband amplifiers  in a  square foot engineering and manufacturing facility on more than two acres of land in melville  new york and a  square foot facility in topsfield  massachusetts 
we lease the new york facility from a partnership controlled by our chairman  chief executive officer and president 
the lease  as amended  provides for our use of the premises as they now exist for a term of ten years through december we have a right of first refusal in the event of a sale of the facility 
the base annual rent under the lease is subject to customary adjustments 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment manufactures our satellite earth station traveling wave tubes amplifiers  certain solid state amplifiers  and klystron tube amplifiers in two leased manufacturing facilities located in santa clara  california 
these two facilities comprise approximately  square feet and are subject to lease agreements that expire in our rf microwave amplifiers segment also operates a small office in the united kingdom 
although primarily used for our satellite earth station product lines which are part of the telecommunications transmission segment  all three of our business segments utilize our high volume technology manufacturing facilities located in tempe  arizona 
these manufacturing facilities  comprising  square feet  utilize state of the art design and production techniques  including analog  digital and rf microwave production  hardware assembly and full service engineering 
the leases for these facilities expire through fiscal and in each lease we have the option to extend the term of the lease for up to an additional five year period 
as a result of the radyne acquisition  we also currently occupy approximately  square feet of building space in phoenix  arizona 
the lease for this building currently expires in october on august   we adopted and initiated a restructuring plan to achieve operating efficiencies and are currently in the process of consolidating radyne s phoenix  arizona based operations into our tempe  arizona facility 
we are currently in preliminary negotiations with a tenant who subleases  from us  a portion of radyne s phoenix  arizona facility 
this tenant is interested in subleasing the remaining portion of this facility from us 
if these negotiations are not successful  we intend to perform an assessment of whether or not we will be able to sublease the phoenix  arizona facility for the remaining duration of the lease  and at what rent  if any  we might be able to receive  given the poor real estate market conditions in the phoenix  arizona areas as well the uncertainties relating to the local economic environment 
our telecommunications transmission segment leases an additional fourteen facilities  six of which are located in the us the us facilities excluding our arizona based facilities aggregate  square feet and are primarily utilized for manufacturing  engineering  and general office use 
our telecommunications transmission segment also operates five small offices in china  india  north africa  singapore  the united kingdom and canada  all of which aggregate  square feet and are primarily utilized for customer support  engineering and sales 
our mobile data communications segment operates two main facilities aggregating  square feet 
we maintain a  square foot facility located in germantown  maryland which contains our main network operations center 
this lease expires in march our mobile data communications segment also maintains a  square foot facility in ashburn  virginia  which is used to support the design  sales and manufacture of our microsatellite and sens products 
this lease expires in we also have two small offices located in colorado that are primarily used for engineering capabilities 
the terms for all of our leased facilities are generally for multi year periods and we believe that we will be able to renew these leases or find comparable facilities elsewhere 
item legal proceedings in october  our florida based subsidiary  comtech systems  inc csi  received a customs export enforcement subpoena from the us immigration and customs enforcement ice branch of the department of homeland security 
the subpoena relates to csi s million contract with the brazilian naval commission the brazil contract and it required the production of all books  records and documents  including copies of contracts  invoices and payments related to agreements between csi  its agent  its subcontractor and the brazilian government 
we believe that the ice investigation is focused primarily on whether or not csi was in compliance with export related laws and regulations  including the international traffic in arms regulations itar and the export administration regulations 
csi produced documents in response to the subpoena request 
customs officials have detained certain inventory related to the brazil contract pending resolution of this matter 
we engaged outside counsel to assist csi in its response to the subpoena and related matters and to conduct our own investigation 
based on our ongoing investigation into this matter  we believe that the detained inventory  which consists of commercial satellite equipment  was not modified or adapted in any way to meet brazilian military requirements and was only subject to the jurisdiction of the department of commerce and not the jurisdiction of the us department of state 
in addition  in order to provide certain defense services  including conducting factory acceptance testing at csi s florida facility  we obtained a license referred to as a technical assistance agreement taa from the us department of state 
we believe that the taa authorized all activities under the brazil contract that were subject to the jurisdiction of the us department of state 
we believe that csi made a good faith effort to comply with applicable regulations  however  we believe that csi made inadvertent administrative errors resulting in a taa that did not become effective on a timely basis 
the administrative errors relate primarily to the execution of non disclosure agreements nda with certain third country national employees of csi s agent 
these individuals have now signed appropriate ndas  and  in december  csi filed an amended taa with the us department of state 
csi has requested that the us department of state confirm csi s and our view that the brazil contract does not require any other state department license 
in march  the enforcement division of the us department of state informed us that they were reviewing our amended taa 
in may  the us attorney s office in the middle district of florida informed us that  based on its conversations with the ice agent who initiated the subpoena  it was closing its investigation into the brazil matter 
in june  the ice agent informed us that he would recommend that the detained inventory be released back to us upon the us department of state confirming our position that a state department license for the hardware shipped was not required 
in august  the ice agent informed us that the us department of state wanted to clarify certain technical matters and  on its behalf  the ice agent was going to interview one of our engineers 
this interview occurred in september of we continue to remain cautiously optimistic that we will be able to shortly reship the brazil inventory to our customer 
in addition to their review of the brazil contract  in march  the enforcement division of the us department of state informed us that they sought to confirm our company wide itar compliance for the five year period ended march in response  we expanded the scope of our own ongoing investigation 
in june  we provided detailed information and a summary of our findings to the us department of state 
in july  the us department of state requested supplemental information and we responded to their request 
our findings to date indicate that there were certain instances of exports and defense services during the five year period for which we did not have the appropriate authorization from the us department of state  however  none of those instances involved proscribed countries as defined by itar 
we are awaiting additional feedback from the us department of state as it relates to all of the aforementioned matters 
since the receipt of the original brazil subpoena in october  we have engaged outside counsel and export consultants to help us assess and improve  as appropriate  our internal controls with respect to us export controls laws and regulations and laws governing record keeping and dealings with foreign representatives 
in addition  in connection with our august  acquisition of radyne  we are expanding our export internal control assessment to include our newly acquired subsidiaries 
to date  we have noted opportunities for improving our procedures to comply with such laws and regulations  including at our newly acquired radyne subsidiaries and are in the process of making improvements 
during fiscal  we have taken numerous steps to significantly improve our export control processes  including the hiring of additional employees who are knowledgeable and experienced with itar and the engagement of an outside export consultant to conduct additional training 
we are also in the process of implementing enhanced formal company wide itar control procedures  including at our newly acquired radyne subsidiaries 
because our assessments are continuing  we expect to remediate  improve and enhance our internal controls relating to exports throughout fiscal because the above matters are ongoing  we cannot determine the ultimate outcome of these matters 
violations of us export control related laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal fines and or penalties and or result in an injunction against us  all of which could  in the aggregate  materially impact our business  results of operations and cash flows 
should we identify a material weakness relating to our compliance  the ongoing costs of remediation could be material 
in addition  inventory related to the brazil contract including the inventory that has been detained had a net book value of million as of july  if this inventory is permanently seized or not returned to us timely  or we can not resell the inventory to other customers  we would be required to write off the value of this inventory in a future accounting period

we believe many of our solutions play a vital role in providing or enhancing communication capabilities when terrestrial communications infrastructure is unavailable or ineffective 
we conduct our business through three complementary segments telecommunications transmission  mobile data communications and rf microwave amplifiers 
we sell our products to a diverse customer base in the global commercial and government communications markets 
we believe we are a leader in the market segments that we serve 
our telecommunications transmission segment provides equipment and systems that are used to enhance satellite transmission efficiency and that enable wireless communications in environments where terrestrial communications are unavailable  inefficient or too expensive 
our telecommunications transmission segment also operates our high volume technology manufacturing center that is utilized  in part  by our mobile data communications and rf microwave amplifiers segments as well as third party commercial customers who outsource a portion of their manufacturing to us 
accordingly  our telecommunications transmission segment benefits from the related increased operating efficiencies 
our mobile data communications segment provides customers with an integrated solution  including mobile satellite transceivers and satellite network support  to enable global satellite based communications when mobile  real time  secure transmission is required 
our mobile data communications segment also designs and manufactures microsatellites and related components 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment designs  manufactures and markets satellite earth station traveling wave tube amplifiers  klystron amplifiers and solid state amplifiers  including high power  broadband rf microwave amplifier products 
a substantial portion of our sales may be derived from a limited number of relatively large customer contracts  such as our movement tracking system mts contract with the us army and our us army s force xxi battle command  brigade and below command and control systems also known as blue force tracking bft contract  for which the timing of revenues cannot be predicted 
quarterly and period to period sales and operating results may be dramatically affected by one or more of such contracts 
in addition  our gross profit is affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of products  systems and services sold  production efficiencies  estimates of warranty expense  price competition and general economic conditions 
our gross profit may also be affected by the impact of any cumulative adjustments to contracts that are accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
our contracts with the us government can be terminated at any time and orders are subject to unpredictable funding  deployment and technology decisions by the us government 
some of these contracts  such as the mts and bft contracts  are indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts  and as such  the us government is not obligated to purchase any equipment or services under these contracts 
accordingly  we can experience significant fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter and period to period comparisons may not be indicative of a trend or future performance 
revenue from the sale of our products is generally recognized when the earnings process is complete  upon shipment or customer acceptance 
revenue from contracts relating to the design  development or manufacture of complex electronic equipment to a buyer s specification or to provide services relating to the performance of such contracts is generally recognized in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
revenue from contracts that contain multiple elements that are not accounted for under sop are generally accounted for in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue from these contracts is allocated to each respective element based on each element s relative fair value and is recognized when the respective revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
recent acquisitions the radyne acquisition in august  and as more fully described throughout this form k  we acquired radyne for a preliminary aggregate purchase price of approximately million including estimated transaction costs and payments made for outstanding share based stock awards 
we believe that the acquisition of radyne resulted in the following strategic benefits strengthened our leadership position in our satellite earth station product lines in our telecommunications transmission segment  more than doubled the size of our rf microwave amplifiers segment by expanding our amplifier product portfolio and immediately positioning us as a leader  not only in the solid state amplifier market  but in the satellite earth station traveling wave tube amplifier market  broadened the number of products and services that our mobile data communications segment can offer by allowing us to market additional mobile tracking products as well as the design and manufacture of microsatellites and related components  and further diversified our overall global customer base and expanded our addressable markets 
we believe that  over time  we will be able to take advantage of our combined engineering and sales talents to drive further innovation in the marketplace and deliver new and advanced products to our customers in all three of our business segments 
in connection with the radyne acquisition  we also expect that we will be able to achieve operating efficiencies by eliminating redundant functions and related expenses 
in order to achieve these efficiencies  on august   we immediately adopted a restructuring plan and are currently in the process of closing radyne s phoenix  arizona manufacturing facility and integrating that operation into our high volume technology manufacturing center located in tempe  arizona 
in addition  radyne s corporate functions  which were co located in radyne s phoenix  arizona manufacturing facility  are currently being moved to our melville  new york corporate office 
the closing of radyne s facility and related integration is expected to be completed in the second half of fiscal in connection with the realization of operating synergies  we have preliminarily estimated that we may incur up to million of restructuring costs  of which  approximately million relates to possible exit costs relating to the shut down of radyne s phoenix arizona manufacturing facility 
we have already incurred approximately million of severance costs for radyne employees who were notified that they were being terminated on august  we are currently in preliminary negotiations with a tenant who subleases  from us  a portion of the manufacturing facility  and is interested in subleasing the remaining portion of this facility from us 
if the negotiations with this tenant are successful  our actual net cost related to the shut down of the manufacturing facility will be significantly lower 
we anticipate that we will be able to capitalize all of the aforementioned costs as part of purchase accounting in accordance with emerging issues task force  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination eitf 
in addition  in connection with the acquisition  during the three months ended october  our first quarter of fiscal  and in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we expect  based on a preliminary analysis  to record a one time charge of million reflecting the fair market value of in process research and development acquired 
from an operational and financial reporting perspective  as of august   radyne s satellite electronics and video encoders and decoder product lines are now part of our telecommunications transmission segment  radyne s twta and kpa amplifier product portfolios are now part of our rf microwave amplifiers segment and radyne s microsatellites and sens products are now part of our mobile data communications segment 
other tactical and product line acquisitions in august  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of insite consulting  inc insite  a logistics application software company  for million  including transaction costs of million 
insite has developed the geoops enterprise location monitoring system  a software based solution that allows customers to integrate legacy data systems with near real time logistics and operational data systems 
this operation was combined with our existing business and is part of our mobile data communications segment 
in february  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of digicast networks  inc digicast  a manufacturer of digital video broadcasting equipment  for million 
this operation was combined with our existing business and is part of the telecommunications transmission segment 
in july  we acquired the network backhaul assets and the netperformer and accessgate product lines of verso technologies verso for approximately million 
this operation was combined with our existing business and is part of our telecommunications transmission segment 
critical accounting policies we consider certain accounting policies to be critical due to the estimation process involved in each 
revenue recognition on long term contracts 
revenues and related costs from long term contracts relating to the design  development or manufacture of complex electronic equipment to a buyer s specification or to provide services relating to the performance of such contracts are recognized in accordance with sop we primarily apply the percentage of completion method and generally recognize revenue based on the relationship of total costs incurred to total projected costs  or  alternatively  based on output measures  such as units delivered or produced 
profits expected to be realized on such contracts are based on total estimated sales for the contract compared to total estimated costs  including warranty costs  at completion of the contract 
these estimates are reviewed and revised periodically throughout the lives of the contracts  and adjustments to profits resulting from such revisions are made cumulative to the date of the change 
estimated losses on long term contracts are recorded in the period in which the losses become evident 
long term us government cost reimbursable type contracts are also specifically covered by accounting research bulletin no 
government contracts  cost plus fixed fee contracts arb  in addition to sop we have been engaged in the production and delivery of goods and services on a continual basis under contractual arrangements for many years 
historically  we have demonstrated an ability to accurately estimate revenues and expenses relating to our long term contracts 
however  there exist inherent risks and uncertainties in estimating revenues  expenses and progress toward completion  particularly on larger or longer term contracts 
if we do not accurately estimate the total sales  related costs and progress towards completion on such contracts  the estimated gross margins may be significantly impacted or losses may need to be recognized in future periods 
any such resulting changes in margins or contract losses could be material to our results of operations and financial position 
in addition  most government contracts have termination for convenience clauses that provide the customer with the right to terminate the contract at any time 
such terminations could impact the assumptions regarding total contract revenues and expenses utilized in recognizing profit under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
changes to these assumptions could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
historically  we have not experienced material terminations of our long term contracts 
we also address customer acceptance provisions in assessing our ability to perform our contractual obligations under long term contracts 
our inability to perform on our long term contracts could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition 
historically  we have been able to perform on our long term contracts 
accounting for stock based compensation 
as discussed further in notes to consolidated financial statements note j accounting for stock based compensation  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r on august  using the modified prospective method 
we have used and expect to continue to use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the estimated fair value of stock based awards 
the black scholes option pricing model includes assumptions regarding dividend yields  expected volatility  expected option term and risk free interest rates 
the assumptions used in computing the fair value of stock based awards reflect our best estimates  but involve uncertainties relating to market and other conditions  many of which are outside of our control 
we estimate expected volatility by considering the historical volatility of our stock  the implied volatility of publicly traded stock options in our stock and our expectations of volatility for the expected term of stock based compensation awards 
as a result  if other assumptions or estimates had been used for options granted  stock based compensation expense that was recorded could have been materially different 
furthermore  if different assumptions are used in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the future 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of july   our goodwill and other intangible assets aggregated million 
this amount will materially increase as a result of the radyne acquisition 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  we must make various assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors in determining the fair values of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets in future periods 
any such resulting impairment charges could be material to our results of operations 
provision for warranty obligations 
we provide warranty coverage for most of our products  including products under long term contracts  for a period of at least one year from the date of shipment 
we record a liability for estimated warranty expense based on historical claims  product failure rates and other factors 
costs associated with some of our warranties that are provided under long term contracts are incorporated into our estimates of total contract costs 
there exist inherent risks and uncertainties in estimating warranty expenses  particularly on larger or longer term contracts 
as such  if we do not accurately estimate our warranty costs  any changes to our original estimates could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
accounting for income taxes 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the provision for income taxes is based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates in the tax jurisdictions where we operate  permanent differences between financial reporting and tax reporting and available credits and incentives 
we recognize interest and penalties related to certain uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
the us federal government is our most significant income tax jurisdiction 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and tax positions 
we may be challenged upon review by the applicable taxing authority and positions taken by us may not be sustained 
we recognize all or a portion of the benefit of income tax positions only when we have made a determination that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination  based upon the technical merits of the position 
for tax positions that are determined as more likely than not to be sustained upon examination  the tax benefit recognized is the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the development of reserves for income tax positions requires consideration of timing and judgments about tax issues and potential outcomes  and is a subjective critical estimate 
in certain circumstances  the ultimate outcome of exposures and risks involves significant uncertainties 
if actual outcomes differ materially from these estimates  they could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
as discussed in notes to consolidated financial statements note h income taxes and note income taxes  on august  we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no

provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and future usage trends 
other factors may also influence our provision  including decisions to exit a product line  technological change and new product development 
these factors could result in a change in the amount of excess and obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if we determine that our inventory was overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our financial statements at the time of such determination 
any such charges could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon customer payment history and current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of our customers current credit information 
generally  we will require cash in advance or payment secured by irrevocable letters of credit before an order is accepted from an international customer that we do not do business with regularly 
in addition  we seek to obtain insurance for certain international customers 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
measurement of such losses requires consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and the financial health of specific customers 
changes to the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts could be material to our results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of our consolidated net sales fiscal years ended july  net sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses amortization of intangibles operating income interest expense income  net income before provision for income taxes net income business outlook for fiscal we expect that fiscal will be another record year of net sales and net income 
we believe we will continue to successfully execute our business strategies  that we will continue to experience organic growth in our existing businesses and that we will generate incremental net sales and net income as a result of the radyne acquisition 
our outlook by business segment is noted below telecommunications transmission segment we expect that annual net sales in our telecommunications transmission segment will increase in fiscal our acquisition of radyne has further strengthened our leadership position in our satellite earth station product line and we expect annual sales of our satellite earth station products to increase as we believe we will benefit from ongoing strong demand for our bandwidth efficient satellite earth station modems  including those used to support cellular backhaul applications 
annual sales of over the horizon microwave systems are also expected to increase 
we continue to be involved in lengthy negotiations and discussions related to a number of large over the horizon microwave system opportunities  and  although it is extremely difficult to predict the timing of any potential contract award  we believe that we will be awarded one or more contracts relating to these opportunities during fiscal sales in our telecommunications transmission segment can fluctuate dramatically from period to period due to many factors including the strength of our satellite earth station product line bookings and the timing and related receipt of and performance on  large contracts from the us government and international customers for our over the horizon microwave system contracts 
mobile data communications segment we expect that annual net sales in our mobile data communications segment will increase in fiscal  primarily due to increased demand for mts product and services 
through july   we have received million in new orders under the mts contract and have now supplied over  transceivers to the mts program 
there is approximately million of potential mts funding available from the global war on terrorism gwot funding supplement and million from the government s fiscal base budget 
in addition  there is million of potential mts funding available for the government s fiscal budget including gwot 
although we do not expect to receive the full amount of the remaining potential mts funding available in fiscal  we expect orders and related revenue in fiscal to increase as compared to the amount we received in fiscal we also believe that demand for our bft products and services will remain strong 
through july   we have received million in new orders under the bft contract and have now supplied over  transceivers to the bft program 
we continue to be focused on maintaining and expanding our role in both the mts and bft programs by upgrading and enhancing the performance of our satellite network and transceivers 
in addition  as a result of the radyne acquisition  we expect to generate incremental revenue in fiscal from the design and manufacture of microsatellites and from mobile tracking products that incorporate sens technology 
sales and profitability in our mobile data communications segment can fluctuate dramatically from period to period due to many factors including unpredictable funding  deployment and technology decisions by the us government as well as risks from the uncertainty of prevailing political conditions 
rf microwave amplifiers segment we believe that annual net sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment will increase 
as a result of our acquisition of radyne  we more than doubled the size of our rf microwave amplifiers segment and immediately positioned ourselves  not only as a leader in the solid state amplifier market  but as a leader in the satellite earth station traveling wave tube amplifier market and expanded our rf microwave amplifier segment s product portfolio to include klystron tube power amplifiers 
these products are used on us government satellite programs including the family of advanced beyond line of sight terminal and the wideband global satellite communications programs 
sales of our solid state high power broadband amplifiers are expected to be comparable to the levels experienced in fiscal although we currently expect sales of amplifiers that are used on the crew program to decline from the levels achieved in fiscal  we believe we will experience increased sales of solid state  high power  broadband amplifiers used for other defense related and satellite applications 
sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment can fluctuate dramatically from period to period due to many factors including the receipt of and performance on  large contracts from the us government and international customers 
in addition  sales and profitability can fluctuate due to longer than anticipated production times associated with contracts for certain complex amplifiers and high power switches that employ newer technology 
our gross profit  as a percentage of fiscal net sales  is expected to decline from the percentage achieved in fiscal  primarily due to the inclusion of sales of radyne s products which traditionally have been sold at gross margins below those of our existing businesses 
in connection with our acquisition of radyne  on august   we initiated a restructuring plan to achieve operating efficiencies by eliminating redundant functions and related expenses by closing radyne s phoenix  arizona manufacturing facility and integrating that operation into our high volume technology manufacturing center located in tempe  arizona 
we expect this integration to be completed during the second half of fiscal our gross margin in fiscal will also be negatively impacted by amortization of million related to the estimated fair value step up of inventory acquired 
selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal  as a percentage of net sales  are expected to be slightly lower than our historical spending pattern over the past three years  as we expect to benefit from synergies associated with the acquisition of radyne 
we are currently in the process of integrating radyne s corporate functions  into our melville  new york corporate headquarters 
we expect this integration to be completed by the second half of fiscal research and development expenses for fiscal  as a percentage of net sales  are expected to be comparable to our historical spending pattern over the past three years 
during fiscal  we believe that we will begin to take advantage of our combined engineering and sales talents to drive further innovation in the marketplace and deliver new and advanced products to our customers in all three of our business segments 
in addition  in connection with the acquisition  during the three months ended october  our first quarter of fiscal  and in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we expect  based on a preliminary analysis  to record a one time amortization charge of million reflecting the fair value of in process research and development acquired 
total amortization of stock based compensation expense which is allocated to the cost of sales  selling  general and administrative and research and development expense line items in our consolidated statement of operations for fiscal  is expected to be similar to fiscal amortization of intangibles is expected to substantially increase in fiscal due to the radyne and verso acquisitions 
we are accounting for both the acquisitions of radyne and verso in accordance with sfas no 
as of august   and based on our preliminary estimates  we expect incremental amortization of approximately million  of which million to be recorded as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations is related to amortization of intangibles and million to be recorded as cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations is related to the estimated fair value step up of radyne s inventory acquired 
interest income is expected to be significantly lower due to the decline in interest rates as well as the use of cash for the radyne acquisition 
we expect to earn approximately to on our cash and cash equivalents in fiscal interest expense is expected to primarily reflect interest associated with our convertible notes 
our estimated tax rate of for fiscal reflects the fact  among others  that the federal research and experimentation r e credit has expired as of december  our tax rate for fiscal was 
based on the aforementioned  we believe our net income will increase from the levels achieved in fiscal and that fiscal will be another record year 
comparison of fiscal and net sales 
consolidated net sales were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  representing an increase of million  or 
the increase in net sales reflects significant growth in both our mobile data communications and rf microwave amplifiers segments  partially offset by lower net sales  as anticipated  in our telecommunications transmission segment 
net sales in our telecommunications transmission segment were million and million for fiscal and  respectively  a decrease of million  or 
net sales in this segment reflect increased sales of our satellite earth station products which were more than offset by lower sales  as anticipated  of our over the horizon microwave systems 
sales of our satellite earth station products for fiscal were higher than fiscal as we continue to benefit from the ongoing strong demand for our bandwidth efficient satellite earth station modems  including those used to support cellular backhaul applications 
net sales of our over the horizon microwave systems for fiscal were significantly lower than fiscal primarily due to lower sales of our mbps troposcatter modem upgrade kits for use on the us department of defense s dod an trc digital troposcatter terminals and lower indirect sales to our north african country end customer 
net sales in fiscal include sales of million relating to a gross profit adjustment  as discussed below  on a large over the horizon microwave system contract 
our telecommunications transmission segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal sales and profitability in our telecommunications transmission segment can fluctuate from period to period due to many factors including the book and ship nature associated with our satellite earth station products and the timing of  and our related performance on  contracts from the us government and international customers for our over the horizon microwave systems 
net sales in our mobile data communications segment were a record million for fiscal and million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
this increase in net sales was due to the significant increase in deliveries to the us army for orders placed under our new mts and bft contracts 
deliveries to the army national guard  for orders placed under the mts contract  were significantly lower during fiscal net sales for fiscal included sales of million relating to a favorable gross profit adjustment on our original mts contract 
our mobile data communications segment represented of consolidated net sales for fiscal as compared to for fiscal sales and profitability in our mobile data communications segment can fluctuate dramatically from period to period due to many factors  including unpredictable funding  deployment and technology decisions by the us government 
in addition  both our new mts and bft contracts are idiq contracts  and as such  the us army is generally not obligated to purchase any equipment or services under these contracts 
in addition  we are aware  that on occasion  the us government has experienced delays in the receipt of certain components that are eventually provided to us for incorporation into our mobile satellite transceivers 
if we do not receive these us government furnished components in a timely manner  we could experience delays in fulfilling funded and anticipated orders from our customers 
net sales in our rf microwave amplifiers segment were a record million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million  or 
the significant increase in net sales was due to higher sales of our amplifiers and high power switches that are incorporated into defense related systems  primarily sales associated with our participation in the counter remote control improvised explosive device electronic warfare crew program

the increase in gross profit was attributable to the increase in net sales discussed above and related increased operating efficiencies 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal excluding the impact of adjustments discussed below  our gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal would have been 
the increase in the gross profit percentage from to was driven by an increase in the gross profit percentage in both our mobile data communications and telecommunications transmission segments 
these increases were partially offset by the impact of a higher percentage of consolidated net sales occurring within the mobile data communications segment  which typically has a lower gross profit percentage than our telecommunications transmission segment 
in addition  in fiscal  we experienced a lower gross profit percentage in our rf microwave amplifiers segment 
our mobile data communications segment experienced a higher gross profit percentage due to increased operating efficiencies associated with increased sales related to our new mts and bft contracts and a more favorable product mix during fiscal as compared to fiscal our telecommunications transmission segment experienced a higher gross profit percentage as it benefited from increased usage of our high volume technology manufacturing center including both incremental satellite earth station product sales and use by our two other operating segments that was partially offset by lower sales of our mbps troposcatter modem upgrade kits 
in addition  in fiscal our telecommunications transmission segment s gross profit percentage was favorably impacted by a million reduction in our estimated reserve for warranty obligations due to lower than anticipated claims received on contracts whose warranty periods have expired 
our rf microwave amplifiers segment experienced a lower gross profit percentage due to long production times associated with contracts for certain complex amplifiers and high power switches that employ newer technology 
during fiscal we recorded favorable cumulative gross profit adjustments of million of which million related to the mobile data communications segment and million related to the telecommunications transmission segment  resulting from our ongoing review of total estimated contract revenues and costs  and the related gross margin at completion  on long term contracts 
these adjustments were partially offset by a million firmware related warranty provision in our mobile data communications segment

interest expense was million for both fiscal and interest expense primarily relates to our convertible senior notes 
interest income and other 
interest income and other for fiscal was million  as compared to million for fiscal the million increase was primarily due to an increase in interest rates and additional investable cash since july provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes was million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
our effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the passage of legislation  in fiscal  extending the federal research and experimentation credit  including million of tax benefits related to the retroactive application of the credit to fiscal  and the approval by our stockholders of an amendment to the stock incentive plan the plan which will permit us to claim tax deductions for cash incentive awards anticipated to be paid under the plan without limitation under m of the internal revenue code 
in addition  we also recorded incremental tax benefits aggregating million during fiscal including a million tax benefit due to the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations 
our tax rate for fiscal was favorably impacted by the recording of a net benefit of million primarily relating to the favorable settlement of a state tax matter 
excluding adjustments  our effective tax rate for fiscal approximated 
liquidity and capital resources our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents increased to million at july  from million at july   representing an increase of million 
none of our cash equivalents include municipal auction rate securities 
on august  the beginning of our fiscal year  and as more fully described throughout this form k  we purchased radyne using a portion of our existing cash and cash equivalents for a preliminary aggregate purchase price of approximately million including estimated transaction costs and payments made for outstanding share based stock awards 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities  during fiscal as compared to fiscal  was driven by an increase in working capital requirements associated with the significant increase in sales activity in our mobile data communications and rf microwave amplifiers segments 
the increase in working capital requirements primarily for inventory was driven by the timing of shipments to our customers  as well as the necessary investment in inventory in support of current backlog 
net cash used in investing activities for fiscal was million  of which million was for purchases of property  plant and equipment including expenditures relating to ongoing equipment upgrades as well as enhancements to our high volume technology manufacturing center in tempe  arizona 
in fiscal  we purchased the network backhaul assets and the netperformer and accessgate product lines of verso technologies for approximately million 
through july   we incurred approximately million of acquisition costs associated with the purchase of radyne  of which approximately million were paid 
we currently expect capital expenditures for fiscal to be approximately million to million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal  due primarily to the proceeds from stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plan shares aggregating million and a million excess income tax benefit from the exercise of stock awards 
we have historically met both our short term and long term cash requirements with funds provided by a combination of cash and cash equivalent balances  cash generated from operating activities and financing transactions 
based on our anticipated level of future sales and operating income  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and our cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to meet both our currently anticipated short term and long term cash requirements 
in addition  should our short term or long term cash requirements increase beyond our current expectations  we believe that we would have sufficient access to credit from financial institutions and or financing from public and private debt and equity markets 
as of july   our material short term cash requirements primarily consisted of working capital needs and the million of cash and cash equivalents necessary to complete the acquisition of radyne 
in addition to the aggregate purchase price  the acquisition of radyne also triggered certain liabilities associated with radyne s change in control and professional fee agreements  which we assumed  aggregating million 
our material long term cash requirements primarily consists of the possible use of cash to repay million of our convertible senior notes due  including any interest accreted into the principal amount of the notes after february   and contractual non cancellable lease obligations aggregating million 
we are currently in preliminary negotiations with a tenant who subleases  from us  a portion of radyne s phoenix  arizona facility 
if these negotiations are not successful  we intend to perform an assessment on whether or not we will be able to sublease the phoenix  arizona facility for the remaining duration of the lease  and at what rent  if any  we might be able to receive  given the poor real estate market conditions in the phoenix  arizona area as well as uncertainties relating to the local economic environment 
as of july   million of our convertible senior notes were outstanding 
as discussed further in notes to consolidated financial statements note convertible senior notes due  we could be obligated to repurchase these notes in the short term i if all or a portion of the outstanding notes are converted during a conversion period and we elect to deliver cash to the converting noteholders  ii if we elect to redeem some or all of the outstanding notes on or after february  using cash  or iii upon the occurrence of certain events  including a change in control of our company 
financing arrangement on january   we issued million of our convertible senior notes in a private offering pursuant to rule a under the securities act of  as amended 
for further information concerning this financing  see notes to consolidated financial statements note convertible senior notes due commitments in the normal course of business  we routinely enter into binding and non binding purchase obligations primarily covering anticipated purchases of inventory and equipment 
we do not expect that these commitments  as of july   will materially adversely affect our liquidity 
at july   we had contractual cash obligations to repay our convertible senior notes  operating lease obligations including satellite lease expenditures relating to our mobile data communications segment contracts and the financing of a purchase of proprietary technology 
payments due under these long term obligations  excluding interest on the convertible senior notes  are as follows obligations due by fiscal years in thousands total and and after convertible senior notes operating lease commitments other obligations total contractual cash obligations on august  the beginning of our fiscal year  and as more fully described throughout this form k  we purchased radyne using a portion of our existing cash and cash equivalents for a preliminary aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
the acquisition of radyne also triggered certain liabilities associated with radyne s change in control and professional fee agreements aggregating million 
in addition  on august   we immediately adopted a restructuring plan and are currently in the process of closing radyne s phoenix  arizona manufacturing facility and integrating that operation into our high volume technology manufacturing center located in tempe  arizona 
radyne s corporate functions  which were co located in radyne s phoenix  arizona manufacturing facility  are currently being moved to our melville  new york corporate office 
in connection with the realization of operating synergies  we have preliminarily estimated that we might incur up to million of restructuring costs 
such amounts are not included in the above table 
as further discussed in notes to consolidated financial statements note convertible senior notes due  we may  at our option  redeem some or all of the notes on or after february  holders of our convertible senior notes will have the right to require us to repurchase some or all of the outstanding notes on february   february  and february  and upon certain events 
the notes can be converted  at the option of the noteholders  during the conversion period of september  through december  upon receiving notification of a noteholder s intent to convert  we  in accordance with the provisions of the indenture  will inform the noteholder of our intention to deliver shares of common stock or cash  or a combination thereof 
we have entered into standby letter of credit agreements with financial institutions relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts 
at july   the balance of these agreements was million 
legal proceedings brazil subpoena and export matters in october  our florida based subsidiary  comtech systems  inc csi  received a customs export enforcement subpoena from the us immigration and customs enforcement ice branch of the department of homeland security 
the subpoena relates to csi s million contract with the brazilian naval commission the brazil contract and it required the production of all books  records and documents  including copies of contracts  invoices and payments related to agreements between csi  its agent  its subcontractor and the brazilian government 
we believe that the ice investigation is focused primarily on whether or not csi was in compliance with export related laws and regulations  including the international traffic in arms regulations itar and the export administration regulations 
csi produced documents in response to the subpoena request 
customs officials have detained certain inventory related to the brazil contract pending resolution of this matter 
we engaged outside counsel to assist csi in its response to the subpoena and related matters and to conduct our own investigation 
based on our ongoing investigation into this matter  we believe that the detained inventory  which consists of commercial satellite equipment  was not modified or adapted in any way to meet brazilian military requirements and was only subject to the jurisdiction of the department of commerce and not the jurisdiction of the us department of state 
in addition  in order to provide certain defense services  including conducting factory acceptance testing at csi s florida facility  we obtained a license referred to as a technical assistance agreement taa from the us department of state 
we believe that the taa authorized all activities under the brazil contract that were subject to the jurisdiction of the us department of state 
we believe that csi made a good faith effort to comply with applicable regulations  however  we believe that csi made inadvertent administrative errors resulting in a taa that did not become effective on a timely basis 
the administrative errors relate primarily to the execution of non disclosure agreements nda with certain third country national employees of csi s agent 
these individuals have now signed appropriate ndas  and  in december  csi filed an amended taa with the us department of state 
csi has requested that the us department of state confirm csi s and our view that the brazil contract does not require any other state department license 
in march  the enforcement division of the us department of state informed us that they were reviewing our amended taa 
in may  the us attorney s office in the middle district of florida informed us that  based on its conversations with the ice agent who initiated the subpoena  it was closing its investigation into the brazil matter 
in june  the ice agent informed us that he would recommend that the detained inventory be released back to us upon the us department of state confirming our position that a state department license for the hardware shipped was not required 
in august  the ice agent informed us that the us department of state wanted to clarify certain technical matters and  on its behalf  the ice agent was going to interview one of our engineers 
this interview occurred in september of we continue to remain cautiously optimistic that we will be able to shortly reship the brazil inventory to our customer 
in addition to their review of the brazil contract  in march  the enforcement division of the us department of state informed us that they sought to confirm our company wide itar compliance for the five year period ended march in response  we expanded the scope of our own ongoing investigation 
in june  we provided detailed information and a summary of our findings to the us department of state 
in july  the us department of state requested supplemental information and we responded to their request 
our findings to date indicate that there were certain instances of exports and defense services during the five year period for which we did not have the appropriate authorization from the us department of state  however  none of those instances involved proscribed countries as defined by itar 
we are awaiting additional feedback from the us department of state as it relates to all of the aforementioned matters 
since the receipt of the original brazil subpoena in october  we have engaged outside counsel and export consultants to help us assess and improve  as appropriate  our internal controls with respect to us export control laws and regulations and laws governing record keeping and dealings with foreign representatives 
in addition  in connection with our august  acquisition of radyne  we are expanding our export internal control assessment to include our newly acquired subsidiaries 
to date  we have noted opportunities for improving our procedures to comply with such laws and regulations  including at our newly acquired radyne subsidiaries 
during fiscal  we have taken numerous steps to significantly improve our export control processes  including the hiring of additional employees who are knowledgeable and experienced with itar and the engagement of an outside export consultant to conduct additional training 
we are also in the process of implementing enhanced formal company wide itar control procedures  including at our newly acquired radyne subsidiaries 
because our assessments are continuing  we expect to remediate  improve and enhance our internal controls relating to exports throughout fiscal because the above matters are ongoing  we cannot determine the ultimate outcome of these matters 
violations of us export control related laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal fines and or penalties and or result in an injunction against us  all of which could  in the aggregate  materially impact our business  results of operations and cash flows 
should we identify a material weakness relating to our compliance  the ongoing costs of remediation could be material 
in addition  inventory related to the brazil contract including the inventory that has been detained had a net book value of million as of july  if this inventory is permanently seized or not returned to us timely  or we can not resell the inventory to other customers  we would be required to write off the value of this inventory in a future accounting period 
other legal proceedings the company is party to certain other legal actions  which arise in the normal course of business 
although the ultimate outcome of litigation is difficult to accurately predict  the company believes that the outcome of these actions will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a staff position fsp on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
this fsp requires share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents prior to vesting be accounted for as participating securities for purposes of calculating and presenting earnings per share 
we are required to adopt this fsp  retroactively  beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 
early adoption is prohibited 
as we have not historically issued share based payment awards that contain such rights  the adoption of this fsp will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 determining whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf 
this eitf provides guidance on whether or not a freestanding financial instrument or embedded contract feature must be accounted for as a derivative instrument 
we are required to adopt this eitf beginning in the first quarter of our fiscal year 
early adoption is prohibited for those entities that already elected an alternative accounting policy 
since we only have freestanding financial instruments or embedded features that are either indexed to our stock and that would be classified as equity if they were a freestanding instrument  the adoption of this eitf will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued fsp accounting principles board apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb  which clarifies that convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement are not addressed by paragraph of apb opinion no 
 accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants 
in addition  fsp apb indicates that issuers of such instruments generally should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
fsp apb is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is prohibited 
we must adopt fsp apb beginning in the first quarter of fiscal and will be required to retroactively present prior period information 
fsp apb is applicable to our million convertible senior notes 
with respect to the impact of adoption  the fsp will require us to retroactively separate the liability and equity components of such debt in our consolidated balance sheets on a fair value basis 
the fsp will also result in lower reported net income and basic earnings per share since our historical reported interest expense will be retroactively recorded at our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate  which is higher than the stated convertible debt rate 
due to the fact that we have historically included the common shares issuable upon conversion of the notes and adjusted our net income to reflect our nonconvertible debt borrowing rate in diluted earnings per share  the adoption of fsp abp will not impact our historically reported diluted earnings per share

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 
to provide companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the objective of sfas no

to clarify the definition of fair value  establish a framework for measuring fair value and expand the disclosures on fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
sfas no 
also stipulates that  as a market based measurement  fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between a market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and b the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from our investment of available cash balances 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
if the interest rate we receive on our investment of available cash balances excluding approximately million that was used in connection with our radyne acquisition were to change by  our annual interest income would be impacted by approximately million 
our convertible senior notes bear a fixed rate of interest 
as such  our earnings and cash flows are not sensitive to changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
as of july   we estimate the fair market value of our convertible senior notes to be million based on recent trading activity
