item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion is intended to analyze major elements of our consolidated financial statements and provide insight into important areas of management s focus 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
we have accounted for the discontinuance or disposal of certain businesses as discontinued operations  and have adjusted prior period financial information to exclude these businesses from continuing operations 
statements in the following discussion may include forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
see item a 
risk factors  for additional discussion of these factors and risks 
business overview although each of our operating segments continued to capitalize on the current strong demand for our products and services  our results of operations during reflect the significant operating challenges that affected each of our segments during the year 
despite each segment reporting revenue growth compared to the prior year  only our production enhancement division reflected increased profitability  showing a growth of million in pretax profit compared to the prior year 
this division s profit growth was more than offset by the decreased profitability of our other segments  particularly by our maritech resources  inc maritech subsidiary  which  despite a significant increase in oil and gas production  reported a decrease in pretax profit of approximately million compared to maritech s loss was largely due to approximately million  net of intercompany profits  of oil and gas property impairments recorded during the year 
these impairments were primarily due to the reversal of anticipated insurance recoveries as a result of continued delays from our insurance underwriters related to hurricane repair costs  which caused the timing and amount of claim reimbursements on costs incurred  or to be incurred in the future  to become indeterminable 
maritech also recorded approximately million of charges to operating expenses also resulting from the reversal of anticipated insurance recoveries previously recorded as insurance receivables related to certain hurricane repair expenses 
in addition  maritech reported million of decreased pretax profit due to decreased realized oil and gas prices during our fluids division pretax profits decreased by million compared to  largely due to increased product costs  a temporary decrease in shallow water offshore demand  and the cost associated with the termination of a previous supply agreement 
our wa d services segment was hampered during the year by operating inefficiencies  unfavorable terms on certain contracts  and vessel utilization issues 
although consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to during  each of our segments took steps needed to improve their profitability  and to attempt to capitalize on the expected continuing increase in revenues in the future 
we continued to execute our long term growth strategy during  resulting in continuing expansion of our operations  through both internal and external growth 
our maritech operation continues to grow rapidly  through additional oil and gas property acquisitions  and a significant exploitation and development program  resulting in unprecedented oil and gas production levels for this segment 
we also continue to grow geographically  with new international expansion during the year for our production testing  compression services  and fluids and completion services operations 
we expended million of cash acquisition and capital expenditure activity during  however  the december sale of our process services operation generated approximately million 
we intend to continue our growth initiatives  having budgeted over million of capital expenditure activity during significant capital projects planned during the coming year include continuing development of our fluids division s new arkansas calcium chloride plant  continuing development of maritech oil and gas properties  continuing growth of our compression services and production testing fleets  and the construction of a new corporate headquarters building 
we plan to fund these growth projects with our operating cash flow and our long term borrowing capabilities 
although we expect our outstanding debt balance to increase during as a result of our capital expenditure plans  we are carefully managing our debt balance  through the application of any excess operating cash flow 
our total debt to equity ratio was as of december  demand for our products and services depends primarily on activity in the oil and gas exploration and production industry  which is significantly affected by that industry s level of expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves and for the plugging and decommissioning of abandoned oil and gas properties 
industry expenditures  as indicated by rig count statistics and other measures  have generally risen during the past five years and reflect the industry s response to higher crude oil and natural gas pricing during this period 
continued overall strong demand is largely dependent on continued high oil and gas pricing  although we believe that there will also continue to be growth opportunities for our products and services in both the us and international markets  supported primarily by increases in technologically driven deepwater gas well completions in the gulf of mexico  continued reservoir depletion in the us  advancing age of offshore platforms in the gulf of mexico  and increasing development of oil and gas reserves abroad 
our fluids division generates revenues and cash flows by manufacturing and selling completion fluids and providing filtration and associated products and engineering services to domestic and international exploration and production companies 
the demand for these products and services is particularly affected by drilling activity in the gulf of mexico  which has remained flat or has decreased during the past several years due largely to the maturity of the producing fields in the heavily developed portions of the gulf of mexico 
significantly offsetting this impact is the current industry trend for drilling deep water wells that generally require greater volumes of more expensive brine solutions 
in addition  international demand for our fluids division products has been generally increasing 
the fluids division also provides liquid and dry calcium chloride products manufactured at its production facilities or purchased from third party suppliers to a variety of markets outside the energy industry 
fluids division revenues increased during compared to the prior year due to increased prices and service activity 
further growth by our fluids division is predicated on the availability of certain raw materials at acceptable cost levels and increasing demand for our products and services at acceptable sales prices 
in late  our fluids division executed an agreement for the favorable long term supply for bromine  which is used in the manufacture of bromide completion fluids  and in late  entered into an agreement with our previous supplier whereby in consideration of our agreement to pay million  we were released from our remaining purchase requirements under our previous supply agreement  in order to accelerate the transition to this new favorable supply 
our wa d division consists of two operating segments the wa d services and maritech segments 
wa d services generates revenues and cash flows by performing well plug and abandonment  pipeline and platform decommissioning  and removal and site clearance services for oil and gas companies 
in addition  the segment provides diving  marine  engineering  cutting  workover  drilling and other services 
the segment s services are marketed primarily in the gulf coast region of the us  including onshore  offshore and in inland waters 
long term gulf of mexico platform decommissioning and well abandonment activity levels are driven primarily by mms regulations and the age of producing fields  and production platforms  and other structures 
in the shorter term  activity levels are driven by oil and gas commodity prices  sales activity of mature oil and gas producing properties  and overall oil and gas company activity levels 
in addition  the segment intends to capitalize on the current demand for well abandonment and decommissioning activity in the gulf of mexico  including a portion of the work to be performed over the next several years on offshore properties that were damaged or destroyed by the significant hurricanes that occurred in wa d services revenues increased by during  primarily due to increased activity levels for well abandonment and decommissioning services  the division s increased capacity to perform those services  and from the march acquisition of epic diving marine services epic 
approximately of the revenues generated by the wa d services segment were from work performed for maritech  and were eliminated in consolidation 
our maritech segment acquires  manages  develops  and exploits producing oil and gas properties and generates revenues and cash flows from the sale of the associated oil and natural gas production volumes 
through maritech  our wa d division provides oil and gas companies with alternative ways of managing their well abandonment obligations  while effectively baseloading well abandonment and decommissioning work for the wa d services segment of the division 
during  maritech s operations reflected significant increased production volumes and revenues primarily as a result of recent exploitation and development efforts conducted primarily on oil and gas properties acquired in  which more than offset the normal production declines 
during the two year period ended december   maritech has expended approximately million on development and exploitation projects 
accordingly  maritech s revenues during increased by compared to  despite decreased realized natural gas prices during the year 
in december  we acquired certain proved and unproved oil and gas properties from a subsidiary of cimarex energy company the cimarex properties which should provide maritech with additional attractive development projects during and beyond 
maritech expects that the new production volumes resulting from current and future development activities will also generate increased revenues and cash flows during compared to maritech continues to assess the remaining well intervention and debris removal efforts associated with three offshore platforms that were destroyed in the hurricanes 
maritech continues to believe that such hurricane related costs incurred and to be incurred are covered costs pursuant to its various insurance policies 
our production enhancement division generates revenues and cash flows by performing flowback pressure  volume testing  wellhead compression  and other services for oil and gas producers 
the primary testing markets served are in texas  new mexico  colorado  oklahoma  arkansas  louisiana  the us gulf of mexico  and certain international markets 
the division s production testing operations are generally driven by the demand for natural gas and oil and the resulting industry drilling and completion activities in the markets which the division serves 
compressco  the division s wellhead compression service provider  markets its services principally in the mid continent  mid western  western  rocky mountain  and gulf coast regions of the united states as well as in western canada  mexico  and other latin american countries 
demand for wellhead compression services is generally driven by the need to boost production in certain mature gas wells with declining production 
production enhancement division revenues increased in as compared to  primarily due to the growth of the division s existing domestic production testing and compressco operations  as well as from a march acquisition  which expanded the division s production testing market territory into western texas and eastern new mexico 
we anticipate continued growth in revenues and cash flows from the division during  as its domestic operations continue to grow as a result of increased industry activity  and as the division continues to seek new domestic and international markets for its testing and compressco operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates  and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments  including those related to potential impairments of long lived assets including goodwill  the collectibility of accounts receivable  and the current cost of future abandonment and decommissioning obligations 
note b summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on future expectations  which we believe are reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for judgments made about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these judgments and estimates may change as new events occur  as new information is acquired  and with changes in our operating environment 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates  and those differences may be material 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the determination of impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  is conducted periodically whenever indicators of impairment are present 
goodwill is assessed for potential impairment at least annually 
if such indicators are present  the determination of the amount of impairment is based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical  and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  particularly in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
oil and gas properties maritech accounts for its interests in oil and gas properties using the successful efforts method  whereby costs incurred to drill and equip development wells  including unsuccessful development wells  are capitalized  and costs related to unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed as incurred 
all capitalized costs are accumulated and recorded separately for each field  and are depleted on a unit of production basis  based on the estimated remaining proved oil and gas reserves of each field 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering  and economic data for each reservoir 
as a result  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  cash flows  development expenditures  operating and abandonment expenses  and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those initially estimated by maritech 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of proved reserves 
maritech s oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment in value whenever indicators become evident  with any impairment charged to expense 
maritech purchases oil and gas properties and assumes the associated well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
any significant differences in the actual amounts of oil and gas production cash flows produced or decommissioning costs incurred  compared to the estimated amounts recorded  will affect our anticipated profitability 
decommissioning liabilities we estimate the third party market values including an estimated profit to plug and abandon the wells  decommission the pipelines and platforms and clear the sites  and use these estimates to record maritech s well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities  net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any contractual amount to be paid by the previous owners of the property referred to as decommissioning liabilities 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  we perform detailed estimating procedures  analysis  and engineering studies 
whenever practical  maritech utilizes the services of its affiliated companies to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
when these services are performed by an affiliated company  all recorded intercompany revenues are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
any profit we earn in performing such abandonment and decommissioning operations on maritech s properties is recorded as the work is performed 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
once a maritech well abandonment and decommissioning project is performed  any remaining decommissioning liability in excess of the actual cost of the work performed is recorded as additional profit on the project and included in earnings in the period in which the project is completed 
conversely  actual costs in excess of the decommissioning liability are charged against earnings in the period in which the work is performed 
we review the adequacy of our decommissioning liability whenever indicators suggest that either the amount or timing of the estimated cash flows underlying the liability have changed materially 
the timing and amounts of these cash flows are subject to changes in the energy industry environment and may result in additional liabilities recorded  which  in turn  would increase the carrying values of the related properties 
revenue recognition we generate revenue on certain well abandonment and decommissioning projects under contracts which are typically of short duration  and that provide for either lump sum turnkey charges or specific time  material  and equipment charges  which are billed in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
with regard to turnkey contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
total project revenue and cost estimates for turnkey contracts are reviewed periodically as work progresses  and adjustments are reflected in the period in which such estimates are revised 
provisions for estimated losses on such contracts are made in the period such losses are determined 
bad debt reserves reserves for bad debts are calculated on a specific identification basis  whereby we estimate whether or not specific accounts receivable will be collected 
a significant portion of our revenues come from oil and gas exploration and production companies 
if  due to adverse circumstances  certain customers are unable to repay some or all of the amounts owed us  an additional bad debt allowance may be required 
income taxes we provide for income taxes by taking into account the differences between the financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis amounts 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations 
changes in state  federal  and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition  could affect these estimates 
in addition  pursuant to fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which we adopted on january   we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating income tax uncertainties 
these factors include an evaluation of the technical merits of the tax position as well as the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement 
the actual resolution of those uncertainties will inevitably differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
acquisition purchase price allocations we account for acquisitions of businesses using the purchase method  which requires the allocation of the purchase price based on the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired 
we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired using accepted valuation methods  and in many cases  such estimates are based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows expected to be generated from the acquired assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
we have completed several acquisitions during the past several years and have accounted for the various assets including intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on our estimate of fair values 
goodwill represents the excess of acquisition purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standard r  share based payment sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized during and includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
as amended  accounting for share based compensation sfas no 
 and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted beginning january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method  whereby the compensation cost for stock options was measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee was to pay to acquire the stock 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
we estimate the fair value of share based payments of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model requires a number of assumptions  of which the most significant are expected stock price volatility  the expected pre vesting forfeiture rate  and the expected option term the amount of time from the grant date until the options are exercised or expire 
expected volatility is calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods equal to the expected option term 
expected pre vesting forfeitures are estimated based on actual historical pre vesting forfeitures over the most recent periods for the expected option term 
results of operations the following data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the associated notes contained elsewhere in this report

consolidated gross profit decreased to million during compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue was during compared to during the prior year period 
our profitability during was significantly affected by several factors  which are discussed in detail in the divisional comparisons section below 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million during compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to the increased headcount necessary to support our revenue growth and included approximately million of increased salary  benefits  contract labor costs  and other associated employee expenses  net of decreased incentive compensation 
the increase also included approximately million of increased office expenses and approximately million of increased insurance and bad debt expenses  which were partially offset by approximately million of decreased professional services and other general expenses 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were during compared to during the prior year 
other income and expense other income and expense was million of income during compared to million of income during  due to approximately million of decreased gains from sales of assets and approximately million of decreased equity from earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures 
these decreases were partially offset by approximately million of increased other income  primarily due to a million legal settlement received during the current year period 
interest expense and income taxes net interest expense increased from million during to million during the current year due to increased borrowings of long term debt used to fund our capital expenditure and acquisition requirements during and interest expense will increase in future periods to the extent additional borrowings are used to fund our acquisition and capital expenditure plans 
our provision for income taxes during decreased to million compared to million during the prior year  primarily due to decreased earnings 
net income net income before discontinued operations was million during compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million 
net income per diluted share before discontinued operations was on  average diluted shares outstanding during compared to on  average diluted shares outstanding during the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of  we sold our process services operation for approximately million  net of certain adjustments  as such operations were not a strategic part of our core operations 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to discontinue our venezuelan fluids and production testing businesses due to several factors  including the changing political climate in that country 
income from discontinued operations was million during compared to million during  primarily due to the million after tax gain on sale of the process services operations 
net income was million during compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million 
net income per diluted share was on  average diluted shares outstanding during compared to on  average diluted shares outstanding in the prior year 
divisional comparisons fluids division fluids division revenues during were million  compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million  or 
approximately million of this increase was due to increased service activity  particularly for onshore services 
in september and april  the division completed the acquisitions of certain service assets and operations  expanding the division s completion services operations and allowing it to provide such services to customers in the arkansas  new mexico  texoma  and arklatex regions 
we expect these acquired operations to continue to provide increased service revenues to the division in the future  as much of the anticipated increase during was negatively impacted by rainy weather conditions during a portion of the year 
to a lesser extent  the increased revenues were also due to increased product pricing and international sales of the division s chemicals and cbf products 
a portion of the demand for the division s products and services is affected by the level of drilling activity  particularly deepwater drilling  in the gulf of mexico region 
fluids division gross profit decreased to million during  compared to million during the prior year  a decrease of million or 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to during  from during the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to the increased cost of raw materials for the division s products  which particularly affected the profitability of the division s offshore operations 
in addition  weather conditions during much of negatively impacted the division s onshore and completion services operations 
a favorable long term supply for certain of the division s raw material needs has been secured  and  in december  the division terminated its remaining purchase commitment under its previous supply agreement in consideration of its agreement to pay million  which was charged to operations during the fourth quarter of as a result  the division expects to purchase its future raw material needs at a more favorable cost  which will result in cheaper finished goods inventory costs  which should improve the division s gross profit  particularly after it sells its remaining higher cost inventory 
fluids division income before taxes during totaled million compared to million during  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was primarily generated by the million decrease in gross profit discussed above  along with approximately million of increased administrative expenses  partially offset by approximately million of increased other income  primarily from gains from foreign currency and sales of assets 
wa d division wa d division revenues increased significantly from million during to million during  an increase of million or 
wa d division gross profit during totaled million compared to million during the prior year  a decrease of million or 
wa d division loss before taxes was million during compared to million of income before taxes during the prior year  a decrease of million or the division s wa d services operations revenues increased to million during compared to million in the prior year  an increase of million or 
excluding intercompany work performed for maritech  wa d services revenues increased by million  or 
approximately million of the segment s revenue increase was as a result of the march acquisition of the assets and operations of epic and the subsequent expansion and refurbishment of epic s dive support vessel fleet  which was completed in early  although one of these dive support vessels was idled during a portion of the year for mechanical problems 
additional segment revenue increases were primarily due to increased vessel activity levels during much of  although the utilization of these vessels was somewhat limited due to weather conditions during the second and third quarters 
with its current fleet of three heavy lift vessels  the division aims to continue to capitalize on the current demand for well abandonment and decommissioning activity in the gulf of mexico  including the remaining work to be performed over the next several years on offshore properties that were damaged or destroyed in by hurricanes katrina and rita 
the september acquisition of the assets and operations of eot rentals  llc eot also generated approximately million of increased revenues for cutting tool services provided to the division s customers  and is expected to contribute an additional increase in the future 
the wa d services segment of the division reported a million decrease in gross profit  a decrease  from million during to million during the current year 
wa d services gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to during the current year compared to during the prior year 
despite the increase in revenues  the segment experienced operating inefficiencies caused by weather disruptions and unfavorable contract issues that negatively affected gross profit  particularly during the first three quarters 
in addition  epic s newly refurbished dive service vessels  which were placed into service during the first quarter of  also experienced lower utilization due to weather and maintenance issues  with one of its vessels experiencing significant mechanical problems during most of the third quarter 
during  the wa d services segment charged approximately million to operations related to a contested insurance claim 
in response to the current market demand  we have modified the segment s approach to providing our services associated with platforms that were damaged or destroyed by the storms 
we expect that the segment s gross profit margin will increase during future quarters 
intercompany profit on work performed for maritech s insured storm damage repairs is not recognized until such time as the associated insurance claim proceeds are collected by maritech 
during  intercompany profit of million was eliminated in consolidation 
during  insurance claim collections related to prior year intercompany work performed for maritech contributed to the recognition of an additional million of division intercompany gross profit 
the wa d services segment s income before taxes decreased from million during to million during the current year  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was due to the million decrease in gross profit described above  as well as a million increase in administrative expenses due to the division s growth  partially offset by increased other income of approximately million  primarily from a legal settlement received during the current year 
the division s maritech operations reported revenues of million during compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million  or 
increased production volumes generated increased revenues of approximately million  primarily from successful exploitation and development activities 
during the past two years  maritech has expended approximately million on exploitation and development activities  and such activity is expected to continue in the future  particularly following maritech s acquisition of the cimarex properties in december in addition  during a portion of the first quarter of  many of maritech s producing properties remained shut in as a result of third quarter hurricanes 
these revenue increases from increased production were partially offset by approximately million of lower realized oil and gas prices  including approximately million from decreased pricing for maritech s natural gas production 
realized natural gas prices during included the impact of a natural gas swap derivative hedge contract  which resulted in maritech realizing a price of mmbtu throughout for a portion of its gas production 
this derivative contract expired at the end of during and early  maritech entered into several new commodity hedge contracts extending through  including natural gas swap derivative hedge contracts  which resulted in maritech receiving an average price of mmbtu for a portion of its natural gas production 
in addition  during  maritech recorded approximately million less of prospect and other fee revenues compared to the prior year 
the division s maritech operations reported a negative gross profit of million during compared to million of positive gross profit during  a decrease of million or 
this decrease occurred despite the segment s exploitation and development activity  which resulted in the addition of several newly productive wells 
maritech s gross profit as a percentage of revenues also decreased during the current year to a negative compared to a positive during the prior year 
a large portion of this decrease in maritech s gross profit was due to approximately million of increased oil and gas property impairments 
maritech recorded million of impairments during  primarily due to the reversal of anticipated insurance recoveries as a result of certain future well intervention and debris removal costs being contested by our insurance provider  compared to million of impairments during this decrease in anticipated insurance recoveries further reduced maritech s gross profit associated with certain hurricane damage repair costs incurred  and resulted in a million charge to operating expense  as the timing and amount of the reimbursement of these costs has also become indeterminable 
during the fourth quarter of  maritech filed a lawsuit against certain of its insurance underwriters related to certain contested well intervention and debris removal costs incurred and to be incurred on certain offshore platforms which were destroyed by hurricanes 
in addition  maritech s gross profit decreased due to the decreased realized commodity prices discussed above  million of increased depletion expense  million of increased excess decommissioning and abandonment costs  and million of increased insurance premiums 
during  maritech also recorded increased dry hole costs of approximately million and reflected decreased gains from insurance proceeds compared to the prior year period of approximately million 
the division s maritech operations reported a loss before taxes of million during compared to million of income before taxes during the prior year  a million decrease 
this decrease was due to the million decrease in gross profit and approximately million of decreased gains on sales of properties  partially offset by million of decreased administrative costs compared to the prior year  primarily due to decreased incentive compensation 
production enhancement division production enhancement division revenues increased from million during to million during the current year  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to million of increased revenues from the division s production testing operations  particularly from increased demand for services provided by the beacon resources  llc subsidiary beacon  which was acquired in february increased production testing activity in mexico and brazil also contributed to the increased revenues during compressco revenues also increased by approximately million compared to the prior year period  due to its overall growth both domestically  and in latin america 
compressco continues to add to its compressor fleet to meet the growing demand for its services 
in addition  the division recorded revenues of approximately million during related to an environmental services contract 
production enhancement division gross profit increased from million during to million during  an increase of million or 
each of the areas highlighted in the revenue discussion above contributed to the higher gross profits 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly  however  from during to during  primarily due to increased operating expenses for the division s domestic production testing operations 
income before taxes for the production enhancement division increased from million during to million during the current year  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to the million of increased gross profit discussed above  less approximately million of increased administrative costs and approximately million of decreased other income  primarily from decreased equity earnings in an unconsolidated joint venture and from decreased foreign currency gains 
corporate overhead corporate overhead includes corporate general and administrative expenses  interest income and expense  and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are not allocated to our operating divisions  as they relate to our general corporate activities 
corporate overhead increased by million from million during to million during  primarily due to increased net interest expense of approximately million 
this increase in corporate interest expense during was due to the increased outstanding balance of long term debt  which was used to fund our capital expenditure requirements during and corporate general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million compared to the prior year  as approximately million of increased office expenses and approximately million of increased insurance expenses were offset by approximately million of decreased personnel related costs  primarily due to decreased incentive compensation recorded during in addition  during  we reflected approximately million of decreased other income 
compared to consolidated comparisons revenues and gross profit total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to million during  an increase of 
consolidated gross profit also increased significantly to million during compared to million during  an increase of 
consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue was during compared to during general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million during compared to million during  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to our overall growth and included approximately million of increased salary  incentive  benefits and other associated employee expenses  approximately million of increased office expenses  approximately million of higher professional service expenses  and approximately million of increased insurance expenses  which was partially offset by approximately million of decreased other general expenses 
included as part of increased employee expenses during is approximately million of compensation expense recorded pursuant to sfas no 
r  which was adopted on january  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to approximately during compared to approximately during other income and expense other income and expense was million of income during compared to million of income during  due to approximately million of additional gains on sales of assets in this increase was partially offset by approximately million of decreased other income  consisting primarily of decreased gains from foreign currency fluctuations and decreased earnings from an unconsolidated joint venture 
interest expense and income taxes net interest expense increased from million during to million during due to the significant borrowings of long term debt used to fund our capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions during the periods 
our provision for income taxes during increased to million compared to million during  primarily due to increased earnings 
net income net income before discontinued operations was million during compared to million during  an increase of million 
net income per diluted share before discontinued operations was on  average diluted shares outstanding during compared to on  average diluted shares outstanding in during the fourth quarter of  we sold our process services operation for approximately million  net of certain adjustments 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we made the decision to discontinue our venezuelan fluids and production testing businesses due to several factors  including the changing political climate in that country 
net income from discontinued operations per diluted share during was compared to a net income per diluted share of during  primarily due to decreased process services profitability levels

net income per diluted share was on  average diluted shares outstanding during compared to on  average diluted shares outstanding during divisional comparisons fluids division fluids division revenues increased from million during to million during  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to increased product pricing and service activity  which more than offset the decreased production from our lake charles calcium chloride manufacturing facility  which began operating at a reduced level beginning in late  due to the loss of a major raw material supplier 
fluids division gross profit increased significantly to million during  compared to million during  an increase of million or 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from during to during this increase was primarily due to the increased prices  a more favorable mix of higher margin products and services  and the sale of lower cost inventory during the period 
inventory costs increased during for the division s products and raw materials 
fluids division income before taxes during totaled million compared to million during  an increase of million or 
this increase was generated by the million increase in gross profit discussed above  which was partially offset by approximately million of increased administrative expenses  approximately million of decreased gains on sales of assets  and approximately million of decreased gains on foreign currency fluctuations

wa d division income before taxes was million during compared to million during  an increase of million or 
the division s wa d services segment revenues increased to million during compared to million during  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to the increased well abandonment and decommissioning activity in the gulf of mexico region following the significant hurricanes during the third quarter of as well as the division s increased capacity to serve its customers 
approximately million of this increase was from increased work performed for maritech  and was eliminated in consolidation 
the division anticipates continued increased demand for its services  as operators repair or decommission damaged platforms and pipelines and accelerate their abandonment and decommissioning plans due  in part  to the risk of future storm damage and due to the increased insurance costs related to offshore assets 
to increase its capacity to provide services  the division purchased the db derrick barge in february  made extensive repairs and modifications to one of its existing vessels  and entered into arrangements to lease three additional vessels the anna iv  which was utilized from march to november  the orion  which was leased beginning in july  and the achiever  which was leased beginning in september these vessel leases have subsequently been terminated 
the db was refurbished and it began operating in july the orion and the achiever were placed in service beginning september and october  respectively 
the march acquisition of the assets of epic  a full service diving operation  contributed approximately million of revenues during subsequent to the acquisition of epic  the division purchased and subsequently refurbished a dynamically positioned dive support vessel  which was renamed the epic diver  and refurbished two other epic dive support vessels 
each of these vessels was placed in service during the first quarter of  and they are expected to contribute additional revenues in the future 
the epic acquisition allows the division to provide additional services to its customers  including maritech  and to supply a substantial portion of such services for wa d services operations 
the wa d services segment of the division reported a million increase in gross profit  from million during to million during wa d services gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to during compared to during  primarily due to increased operating expenses caused by weather disruptions 
in addition  the wa d services segment incurred certain expenses related to the expansion of its heavy lift vessel fleet and the refurbishment of one of its existing heavy lift vessels and several of its dive support vessels 
these increased costs were more than offset by the overall increase in segment revenues  and by diving and support operations  which contributed million of segment gross profit 
the division s increased vessel fleet and the addition of the epic diving operations are expected to provide additional efficiencies in the future  as the division attempts to capitalize on the current market demand for its services 
wa d services segment income before taxes increased to million during compared to million during  an increase of million or 
this increase was due to the million increase in gross profit described above  less approximately million  primarily from increased administrative expenses  including the administrative expenses incurred during the year associated with epic s operations 
the division s maritech segment reported revenues of million during compared to million during  an increase of million or 
approximately million of this increase was from increased production volumes primarily due to acquisitions of producing properties and successful exploitation and development activities 
during the third quarter of  maritech acquired producing oil and gas properties in three significant acquisitions 
beginning in the last half of the third quarter of  production from a majority of maritech s producing properties  including its newly acquired properties  was shut in as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita  which caused varying levels of damage to the majority of its offshore production platforms and destroyed three of its platforms and one of its production facilities 
while the vast majority of maritech s properties have resumed production  a small portion of maritech s daily production remains shut in 
in addition  maritech s revenues increased approximately million during as a result of higher realized oil and gas commodity prices compared to the prior year period 
also  maritech reported million of increased prospect fee and service revenue during the current year period 
realized natural gas prices during include the impact of a natural gas swap derivative hedge contract that resulted in maritech realizing a price of mmbtu throughout the year for a portion of its gas production 
this derivative contract expired as of december  the division s maritech segment reported gross profit of million during compared to million during  a million increase 
maritech s gross profit as a percentage of revenues also increased significantly during to compared to during the significant growth in maritech s production volumes primarily resulting from the acquisitions completed during the third quarter of  plus the increased realized commodity prices discussed above was partially offset by approximately million of increased operating expenses  including approximately million of increased depreciation  depletion  and accretion costs primarily associated with production from the newly acquired and developed properties 
this increase in operating expenses also includes approximately million of increased insurance premium costs and approximately million of well intervention costs and other hurricane damage repair costs  charged to earnings  which we believe will not be reimbursed under our insurance coverage 
such costs were either incurred during the period or have been reflected as increased decommissioning liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
partially offsetting these increases  we included approximately million of increased gain associated with insurance claim proceeds in excess of the net carrying value of destroyed assets 
in addition  during  maritech reported an impairment charge of approximately million as required under successful efforts accounting 
the division has completed most of the required repairs to its damaged platform facilities  and has performed certain well intervention operations on wells associated with two of the three destroyed platforms 
maritech is currently assessing the extent of the damages related to the third destroyed platform  as well as the debris removal effort for each of the destroyed platforms 
the division s maritech segment reported income before taxes of million during compared to million during  a million increase 
this increase was due to the million increase in gross profit discussed above and million of increased gains on sales of properties compared to the prior year period  partially offset by million of increased administrative costs associated with maritech s growth 
production enhancement division production enhancement division revenues increased million during compared to  from million during to million during this increase was due to the increased revenues from the division s compressco and production testing operations 
the division s production testing operations revenues increased by million during compared to  due to the first quarter acquisition of beacon  the increased activity from its domestic customers  and from recent growth of its latin american operations  including its operation in brazil 
compressco revenues increased by million compared to the prior year  due to its overall growth domestically  as well as in canada and mexico 
compressco continues to add to its compressor fleet to meet the growing demand for its services 
production enhancement division gross profit increased from million during to million during  an increase of million or 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues also increased  from during to during  reflecting the acquisition of beacon as well as the increased demand for compressor and production testing services described above 
income before taxes for the production enhancement division increased  from million during to million during  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to the increased gross profit discussed above  plus million of increased gains from currency fluctuation  less million of increased administrative costs primarily associated with beacon and compressco  plus million of decreased gains on asset sales 
corporate overhead corporate overhead includes corporate general and administrative expenses  corporate depreciation and amortization  interest income and expense  and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are not allocated to our operating divisions  as they relate to our general corporate activities 
corporate overhead increased from million during to million during  primarily due to the acquisitions and the staff growth resulting from the expansion of its existing businesses 
this growth resulted in increased administrative costs of million 
the increase in administrative costs resulted from million of increased salary  incentive  benefit  and other associated employee expenses  including million of compensation expense required under sfas no 
r  million of increased professional fee expenses  and million of increased office  insurance  and other general expenses 
total estimated unrecognized compensation cost from unvested stock options pursuant to sfas no 
r as of december  was approximately million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
corporate interest expense during increased by million compared to due to the increased outstanding balance of long term debt  which was used to fund our capital expenditure program and the acquisitions completed during the third quarter of and the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources over each of the past three years  we have utilized our operating cash flow and increased borrowing capacity to aggressively grow our businesses  both through acquisitions as well as through our internal capital expenditure plans 
during this three year period  we have generated approximately million of net cash flow from operating activities  million of proceeds from asset sales and other investing activities  and million of debt borrowings  which we used to fund approximately million of capital expenditures  million of business acquisitions  and million of debt repayments 
this growth strategy has resulted in us reporting total assets of approximately billion and total long term debt outstanding of approximately million as of december  during  we invested a total of approximately million in investing activities  including approximately million of cash capital expenditures  approximately million for acquisitions  including the purchase of the eot operation and a fluids transfer operation  and net of approximately million from the disposal of our process services operation 
to fund a portion of this growth  we increased our borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our outstanding long term debt facility is scheduled to mature no earlier than we anticipate capital expenditure activity in of over million  much of which will help further grow our operations 
we continue to generate increased operating cash flow from each of our operating divisions  which we plan to use to fund a majority of these anticipated capital expenditures 
cash flow in excess of our capital expenditures will be used principally to reduce the outstanding balance under our credit facility  which was approximately million as of february  we have additional borrowing capacity of approximately million as of february   and believe we have various options to additionally expand our capital resources should the need arise 
operating activities despite greatly reduced earnings during  cash flow generated by operating activities totaled approximately million  due to the significant non cash charges for depreciation  oil and gas property impairments  the reversal of anticipated insurance recoveries  and other non cash charges during the year 
operating cash flow during increased significantly compared to the prior year  as operating cash flow was net of approximately million of cash expended for increased inventory volumes and costs  and approximately million of increased accounts receivable  due largely to increased amounts pursuant to insured hurricane repair costs 
future operating cash flow is also largely dependent upon the level of oil and gas industry activity  particularly in the gulf of mexico region of the us our increased revenues from existing businesses during reflect the increased demand for a majority of our products and services  and we expect that such demand will continue to be relatively high during the operating cash flow impact from this increased demand is expected to be limited or partially offset  however  by the increased product  operating  and administrative costs required to deliver our products and services and our equipment and personnel capacity constraints 
through december   we have expended approximately million for well intervention and repair work on certain maritech wells and platforms that were damaged or destroyed as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita in we estimate that remaining storm related repairs  primarily the remaining well intervention and debris removal costs associated with three destroyed platforms  will result in approximately to million of additional costs  which are expected to be incurred in and beyond 
approximately million of the repair and well intervention costs previously expended and submitted to insurance have been reimbursed  however  our insurance underwriters have continued to maintain that certain well intervention and repair costs do not qualify as covered costs under the policies 
in addition  the underwriters have maintained that there is no additional coverage provided under an endorsement we obtained in august for the cost of removal of these platforms or for other damage repairs on certain properties in excess of the insured values provided by our property damage policy 
after continuing to provide requested information to the underwriters regarding the damaged wells  and having numerous discussions with the underwriters  brokers  and insurance adjusters  we have yet to receive the requested reimbursement for these contested costs 
in late  we filed a lawsuit against the underwriters in an attempt to collect the reimbursement for these well intervention costs incurred as well as future well intervention and debris removal costs to be incurred 
we continue to believe that these costs are covered costs pursuant to the policies 
however  during the fourth quarter of  we reversed the anticipated insurance recoveries previously included in estimating maritech s decommissioning liability  increasing the decommissioning liability to million to reflect the well intervention work to be performed  assuming no insurance reimbursements will be received 
in addition  we reversed a portion of our anticipated insurance recoveries previously included in accounts receivable associated with certain damage repair costs incurred  resulting in a million charge to operating expense  as the amount and timing of further reimbursements of these costs from our insurance providers are now also indeterminable 
if we successfully collect reimbursements from our insurance providers  such reimbursements will be credited to operations in the periods collected 
future operating cash flow will also be affected by the oil and gas prices received for maritech s production 
during and early  following recent acquisitions and exploitation and development drilling operations that have increased its oil and gas production levels  maritech entered into additional oil and gas derivative transactions  some of which extend through  that are designated to hedge a portion of maritech s operating cash flows from risks associated with the fluctuating prices of oil and natural gas 
future operating cash flow will also be affected by the timing and amount of expenditures required for the plugging  abandonment  and decommissioning of maritech s oil and gas properties 
the third party discounted fair value  including an estimated profit  of maritech s decommissioning liability as of december  totals million million undiscounted 
during  we performed plugging  abandonment and decommissioning operations on a significant number of maritech s properties  extinguishing approximately million of maritech s decommissioning liability 
the cash outflow necessary to extinguish the remainder of maritech s decommissioning liability is expected to occur over several years  shortly after the end of each property s productive life 
the amount and timing of these cash outflows is estimated based on expected costs  as well as the timing of future oil and gas production and the resulting depletion of maritech s oil and gas reserves 
such estimates are imprecise and subject to change due to changing cost estimates  commodity prices  revisions of reserve estimates  and other factors 
during  maritech adjusted its decommissioning liability by approximately million  either based on the cost it incurred for work performed during the year  or related to adjusted estimates of the cost of future work to be performed 
in addition  maritech increased its decommissioning liability associated with the three offshore platforms which were destroyed during the hurricanes 
maritech estimates that future well intervention and debris removal activity associated with these destroyed platforms will cost approximately million 
actual costs could exceed these estimates due to the non routine nature of this work 
maritech s estimated decommissioning liability is net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any contractual amounts to be paid by the previous owners of the properties 
in some cases  the previous owners are contractually obligated to pay maritech a fixed amount for the future well abandonment and decommissioning work on these properties as the work is performed  partially offsetting maritech s future obligation expenditures 
as of december   maritech s total undiscounted decommissioning obligation is approximately million and consists of maritech s liability of million  plus approximately million  which is contractually required to be reimbursed to maritech pursuant to such contractual arrangements with the previous owners 
investing activities during  we expended approximately million of cash for capital expenditures  including the purchase of oil and gas properties  and approximately million of net cash for acquisitions  for a total of million 
in the fourth quarter of  we paid approximately million  subject to further adjustment  for maritech s acquisition of oil and gas properties from cimarex energy the cimarex properties 
a majority of the productive properties will begin production in mid following the completion of a connecting pipeline and the hookup of six subsea wells 
maritech is constructing this connecting pipeline  at an estimated cost of million  which will also serve other producing properties operated by third parties 
in january  we paid approximately million  subject to further adjustment  for maritech s acquisition of oil and gas properties from stone energy company 
in december  we entered into an agreement to sell a portion of maritech s interest in certain of the newly acquired cimarex properties for cash  and such sale is expected to close as early as march in april  we acquired a fluids transfer service operation in exchange for million paid at closing  with additional consideration of up to million to be paid based on revenues generated by the acquired operation over the next two years 
in september  we also acquired the assets and operations of eot  an onshore and offshore cutting tools operation  for million paid at closing  with an additional million to be paid over the next two years 
each of the above transactions was primarily funded by long term borrowings from our revolving bank credit facility 
in december  we sold our process services operation  which we identified as not a strategic part of our core operations 
the sale generated available cash of approximately million  offsetting a large portion of the capital expenditure activity discussed above  and resulting in net cash expended on investing activities of million 
total cash capital expenditures of approximately million during included approximately million by our wa d division 
approximately million was expended by the division s maritech subsidiary  primarily related to acquisition and development expenditures on its offshore oil and gas properties 
in addition  our wa d division expended approximately million relating to the wa d services segment operations  primarily for construction and refurbishment costs on three dive support vessels  which were placed in service during the first quarter of the production enhancement division spent approximately million  consisting of approximately million related to compressco compressor fleet expansion  and approximately million to replace and enhance a portion of the production testing equipment fleet 
the fluids division reflected approximately million of capital expenditures  primarily related to plant expansion projects during the year and the initial phase of the el dorado calcium chloride plant project 
corporate capital expenditures were approximately million 
during the past two years  we have expended an aggregate of million on cash capital expenditures and acquisitions 
of this amount  approximately million  or  has been for the acquisition  development and exploitation of maritech oil and gas properties  and has resulted in significantly increased maritech revenues and cash flows 
the december acquisition of the cimarex properties provides maritech with a significant portfolio of development prospects  which it intends to exploit in the years ahead 
in addition to its continuing capital expenditure program  maritech also continues to pursue the purchase of additional producing oil and gas properties as part of our strategy to support our wa d services operations and to provide additional exploitation and development opportunities 
while future purchases of such properties may also be primarily funded through the assumption of the associated decommissioning liabilities  the transactions may also involve the payment or receipt of cash at closing or the receipt of cash when associated well abandonment and decommissioning work is performed in the future 
we plan to expend over million on additional capital additions during  including maritech s development program 
the significant majority of such planned capital expenditures is related to identified opportunities to grow and expand our existing businesses  and may be postponed or cancelled as conditions change 
projects planned during include the continuing development of our el dorado  arkansas calcium chloride facility and the expansion of the west memphis  arkansas brominated fluids production facility  plans which over the next three years are expected to total approximately million 
also  we have begun the construction of a new corporate headquarters building located in the woodlands  texas  which is expected to cost approximately million 
our growth strategy continues to include the pursuit of suitable acquisitions or opportunities to establish operations in additional niche oil and gas service markets 
to the extent we consummate a significant acquisition  our liquidity position will be affected 
we expect to fund our capital expenditure activity through cash flows from operations and from our bank credit facility 
should additional capital be required  we believe that we have the ability to raise such capital through the issuance of additional debt or equity 
financing activities to fund our capital and working capital requirements  we may supplement our existing cash balances and cash flow from operating activities as needed from long term borrowings  short term borrowings  equity issuances  and other sources of capital 
we have a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks  pursuant to a credit facility agreement which was amended in june and december the restated credit facility 
as of february   following the january acquisition of additional maritech oil and gas properties  we had an outstanding balance of million  and million in letters of credit and guarantees against the million revolving credit facility  leaving a net availability of million 
the restated credit facility  which is scheduled to mature in  is unsecured and guaranteed by certain of our material domestic subsidiaries 
borrowings generally bear interest at the british bankers association libor rate plus to  depending on one of our financial ratios 
as of december   the average interest rate on the outstanding balance under the credit facility was 
we pay a commitment fee ranging from to on unused portions of the facility 
the restated credit facility agreement contains customary covenants and other restrictions  including certain financial ratio covenants  and includes limitations on aggregate asset sales  individual acquisitions  and aggregate annual acquisitions and capital expenditures 
access to our revolving credit line is dependent upon our ability to comply with certain financial ratio covenants set forth in the restated credit facility agreement 
significant deterioration of the financial ratios could result in a default under the restated credit facility agreement and  if not remedied  could result in termination of the agreement and acceleration of any outstanding balances under the facility prior to the restated credit facility agreement also includes cross default provisions relating to any other indebtedness greater than a defined amount 
if any such indebtedness is not paid or is accelerated and such event is not remedied in a timely manner  a default will occur under the restated credit facility 
we were in compliance with all covenants and conditions of our credit facility as of december  our continuing ability to comply with these financial covenants centers largely upon our ability to generate adequate cash flow 
historically  our financial performance has been more than adequate to meet these covenants  and we expect this trend to continue 
in september  we issued and sold through a private placement million in aggregate principal amount of series a senior notes and million euros approximately million equivalent at december  in aggregate principal amount of series b senior notes pursuant to a master note purchase agreement 
the series a senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate of and mature on september  the series b senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate of and also mature on september  in april  we issued and sold through a private placement  million in aggregate principal amount of series a senior notes pursuant to our existing master note purchase agreement dated september  as supplemented the series a senior notes  together with the series a senior notes and series b senior notes are collectively referred to as the senior notes 
interest on the a and b senior notes is due semiannually on march and september of each year 
the series a senior notes bear interest at the fixed rate of  and mature on april  interest on the a senior notes is due semiannually on april and october of each year 
pursuant to the master note purchase agreement  as supplemented  the senior notes are unsecured and guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the master note purchase agreement contains customary covenants and restrictions  requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and contains customary default provisions  as well as cross default provisions relating to any other indebtedness of million or more 
we were in compliance with all covenants and conditions of our senior notes as of december  upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default under the master note purchase agreement  the senior notes may become immediately due and payable  either automatically or by declaration of holders of more than in principal amount of the senior notes outstanding at the time 
in may  we filed a universal acquisition shelf registration statement on form s that permits us to issue up to million of common stock  preferred stock  senior and subordinated debt securities  and warrants in one or more acquisition transactions that we may undertake from time to time 
as part of our strategic plan  we evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses and assets and intend to consider attractive acquisition opportunities  which may involve the payment of cash or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
such acquisitions may be funded with existing cash balances  funds under our credit facility  or securities issued under our acquisition shelf registration on form s in addition to the aforementioned revolving credit facility  we fund our short term liquidity requirements from cash generated by operations  short term vendor financing and  to a lesser extent  from leasing with institutional leasing companies 
we believe we have the ability to generate additional capital to fund our capital expenditure plans through the issuance of additional debt or equity 
in january  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
during and  we made no purchases of our common stock pursuant to this authorization 
during  we purchased  shares of our common stock at a cost of approximately million pursuant to this authorization 
we also received million  million and million during  and  respectively  from the exercise of stock options by employees 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due total thereafter in thousands long term debt interest on debt purchase obligations decommissioning and other asset retirement obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations decommissioning liabilities related to oil and gas properties generally must be satisfied within twelve months after a property s lease expires 
lease expiration generally occurs six months after the last producing well on the lease ceases production 
we have estimated the timing of these payments based upon anticipated lease expiration dates  which are subject to many changing variables  including the estimated life of the producing oil and gas properties  which is affected by changing oil and gas commodity prices 
the amounts shown represent the estimated fair values as of december  amounts exclude other long term liabilities reflected in our consolidated balance sheet that do not have known payment streams 
these excluded amounts include approximately million of liabilities under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlements 
see note f income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
off balance sheet arrangements an off balance sheet arrangement is defined as any contractual arrangement to which an entity that is not consolidated with us is a party  under which we have  or in the future may have any obligation under a guarantee contract that requires initial recognition and measurement under us generally accepted accounting principles  a retained or contingent interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity or similar arrangement that serves as credit  liquidity  or market risk support to that entity for the transferred assets  any obligation under certain derivative instruments  or any obligation under a material variable interest held by us in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development services with us 
as of december  and  we had no off balance sheet arrangements that may have a current or future material affect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
commitments and contingencies litigation we are named defendants in several lawsuits and respondents in certain governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of lawsuits or other proceedings against us cannot be predicted with certainty  management does not expect these matters to have a material adverse impact on the financial statements 
as previously disclosed  our maritech subsidiary incurred significant damage as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita 
although portions of the well intervention costs previously expended on these facilities and submitted to our insurers have been reimbursed  our insurance underwriters have continued to maintain that well intervention costs for certain of the damaged wells do not qualify as covered costs and that certain well intervention costs for qualifying wells are not covered under the policies 
in addition  the underwriters have also maintained that there is no additional coverage provided under an endorsement we obtained in august for the cost of removal of these platforms and for other damage repairs on certain properties in excess of the insured values provided by our property damage policy 
on november   we filed a lawsuit in the th judicial district court  montgomery county  texas  entitled maritech resources  inc v 
certain underwriters and insurance companies at lloyd s  london subscribing to policy no 
gau and steege kingston  in which we are seeking damages for breach of contract and various related claims and a declaration of the extent of coverage of an endorsement to the policy

we have reviewed estimated remediation costs prepared by our independent  third party environmental engineering consultant  based on a detailed environmental study 
the estimated remediation costs range from million to million 
based upon our review and discussions with our third party consultants  we established a reserve for such remediation costs which is included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   and following the performance of certain remediation activities at the site  the amount of the reserve for these remediation costs  included in current liabilities  is approximately million 
the reserve will be further adjusted as information develops or conditions change 
we have not been named a potentially responsible party by the epa or any state environmental agency 
product purchase obligations in the normal course of our fluids division operations  we enter into supply agreements with certain manufacturers of various raw materials and finished products 
some of these agreements have terms and conditions that specify a minimum or maximum level of purchases over the term of the agreement 
other agreements require us to purchase the entire output of the raw material or finished product produced by the manufacturer 
our purchase obligations under these agreements apply only with regard to raw materials and finished products that meet specifications set forth in the agreements 
we recognize a liability for the purchase of such products at the time we receive them 
during  we significantly increased our purchase obligations as a result of the execution of a long term supply agreement with chemtura corporation  and the amendment of a previous supply agreement 
under the amended agreement with the previous supplier  we remained committed to purchase certain volumes of product through in december  we were released from these further purchases pursuant to an agreement terminating the amended agreement in exchange for our agreement to pay million in five installments during and early as of december   the aggregate amount of the fixed and determinable portion of the purchase obligation pursuant to our fluids division s supply agreements  including the buyout installments discussed above  was approximately million  extending through insurance contingencies through december   we have expended approximately million of well intervention work on certain wells associated with three maritech offshore platforms which were destroyed as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita in we estimate that future well intervention efforts related to these destroyed platforms  including platform debris removal  will result in approximately million of additional costs 
approximately million of the well intervention costs previously expended and submitted to insurance have been reimbursed  however  our insurance underwriters have continued to maintain that well intervention costs for certain of the damaged wells do not qualify as covered costs and that certain well intervention costs for qualifying wells are not covered under the policy 
in addition  the underwriters have also maintained that there is no additional coverage provided under an endorsement we obtained in august for the cost of removal of these platforms or for other damage repairs on certain properties in excess of the insured values provided by our property damage policy 
after continuing to provide requested information to the underwriters regarding the damaged wells  and having numerous discussions with the underwriters  we have yet to receive the requested reimbursement for these contested costs 
in late  we filed a lawsuit against the underwriters in an attempt to collect the reimbursement for these well intervention costs incurred as well as future well intervention and debris removal costs to be incurred 
we continue to believe that these costs are covered costs pursuant to the policies 
however  during the fourth quarter of  we reversed the anticipated insurance recoveries previously included in estimating maritech s decommissioning liability  increasing the liability to million to reflect the well intervention work to be performed  assuming no insurance reimbursements will be received  as the amount and timing of further reimbursements from our insurance providers are now indeterminable 
if we successfully collect reimbursements from our insurance providers  such reimbursements will be credited to operations in the period collected 
in addition  in the event that our actual well intervention costs are more or less than the associated decommissioning liabilities  as adjusted  the difference may be reported in income in the period in which the work is performed 
in october  one of our drilling rig barges was damaged by a fire  and a claim was submitted pursuant to our insurance coverage 
the drilling rig barge was repaired during for a cost of approximately million 
in january  we collected approximately million of insurance reimbursements as a result of our claim for the repair costs incurred 
in february  we received a notice from our insurance underwriters  stating that they consider that approximately million of this claim is not covered under the applicable policy 
we have reviewed the underwriters position with regard to this claim  and believe it is without merit 
in august  the underwriters responded to our position with regard to this claim  requested additional information on a portion of the remaining costs incurred  and agreed to continue discussions 
in september  we met with underwriters to discuss the claim and delivered the additional requested information  and we are currently awaiting any further questions 
as of december   approximately million is included in our accounts receivable associated with the repair costs incurred for this asset  as such costs are considered probable of being reimbursed pursuant to our applicable insurance policy 
this amount is net of the approximately million of insurance reimbursements received  and approximately million of costs that were charged to expense during we continue to work with the underwriters to pursue reimbursement of our repair costs 
other contingencies related to its acquired interests in oil and gas properties  our maritech subsidiary estimates the third party fair values including an estimated profit to plug and abandon wells  decommission the pipelines and platforms  and clear the sites  and uses these estimates to record maritech s decommissioning liabilities  net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any amounts contractually agreed to be paid in the future by the previous owners of the properties 
in some cases  previous owners of acquired oil and gas properties are contractually obligated to pay maritech a fixed amount for the future well abandonment and decommissioning work on these properties as such work is performed 
as of december   maritech s decommissioning liabilities are net of approximately million for such future reimbursements from these previous owners 
in march  we acquired beacon  a production testing operation  for approximately million paid at closing and an additional million to be paid  subject to adjustment  over a three year period through march in addition  the acquisition provides for additional contingent consideration of up to million to be paid in march  depending on the average of beacon s annual pretax results of operations over the three year period following the closing date through march through december   we have estimated the amount of beacon s pretax results of operations as defined in the agreement to date since the acquisition and have determined that this amount is less than the amount required to generate a payment pursuant to this contingent consideration provision 
any amount payable pursuant to this contingent consideration provision will be reflected as a liability as it becomes fixed and determinable at the end of the three year period

is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements  but will result in additional disclosures related to the use of fair values in the financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk any balances outstanding under the floating rate portion of our bank credit facility are subject to market risk exposure related to changes in applicable interest rates 
we borrow funds pursuant to our bank credit facility as necessary to fund our capital expenditure requirements and certain acquisitions 
these instruments carry interest at an agreed upon percentage rate spread above libor 
based on the balances of floating rate debt outstanding as of december   each increase of basis points in the libor rate would result in a decrease in earnings of approximately  the following table sets forth  as of december  and  our cash flows for the outstanding principal balances of our long term debt obligations which bear a variable rate of interest and weighted average effective interest rates by their expected maturity dates

in september  we borrowed euros to fund the acquisition of our european calcium chloride assets 
we entered into long term euro denominated borrowings  as we believe such borrowings provide a natural currency hedge for our euro based operating cash flow 
we also have exposure related to operating receivables and payables denominated in euros as well as other currencies  however  such transactions are not pursuant to long term contract terms  and the amount of such foreign currency exposure is not determinable or considered material 
the following table sets forth as of december  and  our cash flows for the outstanding principal balances of our long term debt obligations which are denominated in euros 
this information is presented in us dollar equivalents 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by their expected maturity dates 
as described above  we utilize the long term borrowings detailed in the following table as a hedge to our investment in our acquired foreign operations and  currently  we are not a party to a foreign currency swap contract or other derivative instrument designed to further hedge our currency exchange rate risk exposure 
our exchange rate risk exposure related to these borrowings will generally be offset by the offsetting fluctuations in the value of the related foreign investment

realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices in the us natural gas market 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and such price volatility is expected to continue 
our risk management activities involve the use of derivative financial instruments  such as swap agreements  to hedge the impact of market price risk exposures for a portion of our oil and gas production 
we are exposed to the volatility of oil and gas prices for the portion of our oil and gas production that is not hedged 
net of the impact of the crude oil hedges as of december  described below  each per barrel decrease in future crude oil prices would result in a decrease in after tax earnings of  each decrease in future gas prices of per mcf would result in a decrease in after tax earnings of  fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
as of december  and  we had the following cash flow hedging swap contracts outstanding relating to a portion of our maritech subsidiary s oil and gas production commodity contract daily volume contract price contract term december  oil swap barrels day barrel january  december  oil swap barrels day barrel january  december  oil swap  barrels day barrel january  december  oil swap  barrels day barrel january  december  oil swap barrels day barrel january  december  oil swap barrels day barrel january  december  oil swap barrels day barrel january  december  oil swap barrels day barrel january  december  oil swap barrels day barrel january  december  oil swap  barrels day barrel january  december  natural gas swap  mmbtu day mmbtu january  december  natural gas swap  mmbtu day mmbtu january  december  december  oil swap barrels day barrel january  december  oil swap barrels day barrel january  december  oil swap barrels day barrel january  december  oil swap barrels day barrel january  december  oil swap barrels day barrel january  december  in january and february  we entered into certain natural gas swap contracts  covering a total of  mmbtu day from february to december  with an average contract price of mmbtu 
in addition  we entered into certain natural gas swap contracts  covering a total of  mmbtu day for  with an average contract price of mmbtu 
each oil and gas swap contract uses the nymex wti west texas intermediate oil price and the nymex henry hub natural gas price as the referenced price  respectively 
the market value of our oil swaps at december  was  the portion of this market value associated with swap contracts is reflected as a current liability  and the portion related to later periods is reflected as a long term liability 
a increase in the future price of oil would result in the market value of the combined oil derivative liability increasing by  the market value of our natural gas swaps at december  was  and is reflected as a current asset 
a increase in the future price of natural gas would result in the market value of the combined natural gas derivative asset decreasing by the market value of our oil swaps at december  was  which is reflected as a current asset
