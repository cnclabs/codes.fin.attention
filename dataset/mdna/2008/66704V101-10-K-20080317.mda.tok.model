overview management s discussion and analysis provides additional insight into northstar neuroscience  inc and is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our audited financial statements and accompanying footnotes thereto 
we are a development stage medical device company focused on developing and commercializing innovative neurostimulation therapies to restore function and quality of life for people suffering from neurological diseases and disorders 
we incorporated in the state of washington on may   and since inception we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the development and commercialization of medical technologies utilizing electrical stimulation to treat neurological diseases and disorders 
we are currently conducting  or plan to initiate  clinical trials using our proprietary renova cortical stimulation system for the treatment of major depressive disorder and stroke motor recovery 
we continue to explore additional applications for our cortical stimulation platform and monitor relevant research activities on other neurological diseases and disorders 
we have completed enrollment and are actively treating patients in our prospect trial  which is our initial feasibility trial using cortical stimulation to treat major depressive disorder and in our sahale feasibility trial for tinnitus 
we also have completed enrolling patients in the everest pivotal trial for stroke motor recovery and announced the primary endpoint data in january of from to  we conducted the everest pivotal trial to investigate whether cortical stimulation in conjunction with rehabilitation therapy would lead to improved hand and arm function and activities of daily living compared to the control group which received rehabilitation therapy alone 
on january   we announced that the everest trial did not meet its primary efficacy endpoint and we do not expect ongoing or 
table of contents subsequent analysis  once completed  will demonstrate sufficient evidence of efficacy to pursue marketing approval from the fda based on everest data alone 
we have commenced planning next steps  including additional clinical work and an analysis of the business opportunity for a potentially optimized therapy for stroke motor recovery 
on february   we announced and began implementing restructuring actions with the objective of streamlining our business in response to the announcement of the results of the everest trial 
the restructuring actions include a workforce reduction of approximately 
we intend to focus our ongoing resources on the evaluation and development of our renova cortical stimulation system for the treatment of major depressive disorder  while also pursuing focused research on stroke motor recovery 
we will continue to conduct research on the feasibility of our system for the treatment of other neurological diseases and disorders consistent with our financial and operational resources 
to date  we have not generated any revenue from the sale of cortical stimulation products  and we have incurred net losses in each year since our inception 
the limited revenue we have generated since inception has been from the commercial sale of an earlier product  which was sold to a third party in we expect our net losses to continue  though at a reduced magnitude relative to recent losses  as we continue our clinical trial activities  our research and development efforts  and continue to operate as a public held company 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private placements of equity securities 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate estimates  including  but not limited to those related to share based compensation and clinical trial accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our audited financial statements for the year ended december  we believe that the following accounting policies relating to research  development and clinical trial accruals and share based compensation are the most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
research  development and clinical trial accruals research and development costs are expensed as incurred or paid 
we record accruals for estimated clinical trial costs  comprised primarily of services rendered under contract by our clinical trial sites  based on patient enrollment and progression through the clinical trial protocol 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of our research and development expenses 
share based compensation pursuant to sfas r through december   we accounted for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 or apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation an interpretation of apb  and related interpretations 
we had adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  as amended 

table of contents effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  which requires the recognition of share based compensation expense at fair value 
we adopted sfas r under the prospective transition method and  therefore  we did not restate results for prior periods 
pursuant to sfas r  our estimate of share based compensation expense requires a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns  and future forfeitures 
the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes over its term because of the greater possibility of significant increases in stock price 
we have determined the implied volatility of future periods based primarily on the historical volatility of our common stock subsequent to our initial public offering 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that options granted are expected to remain outstanding 
the expected term also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
further  longer option terms provide more opportunity to exploit market highs 
historical data  however  demonstrates that employees typically do not wait until the end of the contractual term of a nontransferable option to exercise 
when establishing an estimate of the expected term of an award  we continue to use the simplified method of determining expected term as permitted by sec staff accounting bulletins and  as we do not have sufficient exercise experience on which to base a determination of expected term 
we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and from time to time we will likely change the valuation assumptions used to estimate the value of future share based awards granted 
pursuant to financial accounting standards board staff position no 
r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards  we have adopted the simplified method to calculate our additional paid in capital  or apic  pool of excess tax benefit 
this method was used to calculate our beginning apic pool and to determine the subsequent effect on the apic pool for stock based compensation awards that were outstanding upon our adoption of sfas r 
income taxes effective january   we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
based on the implementation guidance set forth in the pronouncement and our review of our tax positions leading up to and subsequent to adoption  fin did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we adopted sfas no 
on january   and we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and 
table of contents certain other items at fair value 
we adopted sfas no 
on january   and we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in june  fasb s emerging issues task force  or eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting for advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  or eitf the consensus will require us to defer and capitalize prepaid  nonrefundable research and development payments to third parties over the period in which the research and development activities are performed or the services are provided  subject to an assessment of recoverability 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and early adoption is not permitted 
subsequent to our adoption of eitf on january   a change in accounting policy will occur whereby nonrefundable prepayments for research and development services will be deferred and recognized as the services are rendered 
under our existing accounting policy such payments are charged to research and development expense as paid 
this accounting policy change may impact our financial condition and the results of operations in the future 
results of operations for the years ended december   and research and development expenses our research and development expenses primarily consist of costs incurred to conduct clinical trials  engineering development costs associated with our renova cortical stimulation system  and regulatory compliance activities 
research and development expenses are comprised of direct clinical trial costs  employee compensation  including share based compensation  supplies and materials  consultant services  information technology support  travel  and facilities 
we expensed research and development costs at the earlier of when they were incurred  or when they were paid and non refundable 
from our inception through december   we have incurred million in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  million in  and million in the million  or  increase in was primarily due to increased compensation and benefits  including stock compensation  of million for additional staffing to support clinical trials and planning for commercialization efforts associated with our renova system 
greater expenses associated with commercialization efforts in can be attributed to prototypes of commercial product and expenses related to engineering consultants increasing in the aggregate by million 
the increases were partially offset by a reduction in clinical trial costs of million  primarily due to the completion of the everest clinical trial enrollment in  and a net increase of other development expenses of the increase of million  or  in compared to was due to substantial increases in expenses related to the everest clinical trial of million and increased headcount related expenses of million  partially offset by a net decrease in other development costs of  we expect our research and development expenses to decrease in principally due to lower overall clinical trial costs since we have no further pivotal trials scheduled for we also expect to experience decreases in activity associated with the commercialization efforts of the renova system 
our research and development efforts will be focused on the treatment of depression  as well as research relating to the viability of treatment of other indications with our renova cortical stimulation system 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses include compensation for executive  finance  intellectual property  marketing and administrative personnel  including share based compensation  and facilities expenses 
other significant expenses include professional fees for accounting and legal services  including legal services associated with our efforts to obtain and maintain protection for the intellectual property related to our cortical stimulation system 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  million in  and million in the million  or  increase in compared to was primarily due to a million increase in compensation and benefits  including stock compensation  for additional staffing to support operating as a publicly held company  infrastructure development  and initial marketing efforts related to commercialization planning 
the expenses also included a million increase in professional services for accounting  investor relations  and legal services relating to public company matters and intellectual property  a  increase in consultant expenses related to reimbursement and it infrastructure development  and a  net increase in other general and administrative expenses  primarily relating to insurance  recruiting  relocation and travel associated with increased personnel 
the increase of million  or  in over was primarily due to increased personnel costs of million  increased professional service costs of million for accounting  investor relations  legal services relating to public company matters and intellectual property  and net increases in other general and administrative expenses of  primarily relating to consultants  board of directors fees and expenses  insurance  market research and reimbursement planning 
we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease in due to a decrease in activity related to commercialization and marketing efforts associated with the stroke motor recovery application of our system  and overall lower headcount related costs as a result of our february reduction in force 
other operating expenses since inception  other operating expenses have included severance expenses  losses on subleases of our facilities  and intellectual property settlements 
no other operating expenses were incurred during during an expense of million was incurred to settle a potential ownership dispute and secure ownership rights related to one of our issued us patents and six of our us patent applications 
the settlement was expensed on the date incurred 
in  we had  of other operating expenses related to a loss on sublet office space 
interest income  net interest income  net was million in  million in  and  in the increase of million in over was due to interest earned on a higher average balance of investments over the full year 
the increase of million in over was due primarily to interest earned on the investment of proceeds received mid year from our initial public offering 
other expenses income  net other expenses income  net included million of expense in  and income of  in the expense of million in was due to losses incurred on debt repayment and non cash warrant revaluation charges 
the other income of  in represents amortization of a gain on assets sold in a prior year 
liquidity and capital resources we have incurred losses since our inception in may and  as of december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of million 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we have funded our operations to date principally from the sale of equity securities  raising net proceeds of million through december  
table of contents cash flow information is as follow  in millions year ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities in   and primarily reflects the net loss for those periods  offset in part by non cash operating expenses including share based compensation  loss on debt repayment  depreciation  and amortization of premiums on investments  and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
net cash provided by and used in investing activities net cash provided by and used in investing activities in   and primarily reflects the net of purchases and maturities of investments and purchases of fixed assets 
net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities during reflects the exercises of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from our initial public offering of million  offset by repayment of debt of approximately million 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily from the issuance of debt 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements to date  we have not commercialized any product based on our cortical stimulation technology and we have not achieved profitability 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur substantial net losses for the next several years as we develop our products  conduct and complete clinical trials  pursue additional applications for our technology platform and expand our clinical development 
we do not anticipate generating any product revenue unless and until we successfully obtain fda approval for  and begin selling  our renova cortical stimulation system 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents  investments  and related interest income will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements into if our available cash  cash equivalents and investments are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  or if we develop additional products or pursue additional applications for our products  we may seek to sell additional equity or issue debt securities before the sale of additional equity securities may result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations 
we will require additional capital beyond our currently forecasted amounts 
any such required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of  delay  or eliminate some or all of  our planned research  development and commercialization activities  which could materially harm our business 
we anticipate spending additional funds over the next year for the development of new applications of our renova system that may also require the expenditure of significant financial resources and take several years to complete  from development to ultimate commercialization 
we expect to fund the development of applications for our renova system with our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances 

table of contents our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations and the costs to complete development of products are forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially and negatively as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development of medical devices  such as our renova cortical stimulation system  we are unable to estimate the exact amounts of capital outlays and operating expenditures necessary to complete ongoing clinical trials and successfully deliver a commercial product to market 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the scope  rate of progress  and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  clinical trial results  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the working capital required for general and administrative expenses  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and potential commercial supplies of our renova cortical stimulation system and any other products that we may develop  the rate of market acceptance of our device  the effect of competing products and market developments  any revenue generated by sales of our future products  the cost of filing and prosecuting patent applications and defending and enforcing our patent and other intellectual property rights  the cost of defending  in litigation or otherwise  any claims that we infringe third party patent or other intellectual property rights  the cost of defending other litigation or disputes with third parties  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products  and technologies 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our outstanding contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period total less than year years years more than years in thousands operating leases total the table above reflects payment obligations that are fixed and determinable 
our commitments for operating leases primarily relate to the lease for our corporate headquarters in seattle  washington 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates primarily due to our investment portfolio 
we maintain an investment portfolio consisting mainly of money market  federal and state government obligations  municipal obligations  corporate obligations  auction rate securities  and asset backed securities 
we have the intent and ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity  therefore  we do not anticipate that changes in market interest rates will have a material impact on our operating results or cash flows 
our investment strategy is governed by a cash and investment policy that strives to preserve capital and is reviewed with our board of directors periodically 
the provisions of our cash and investment policy as of december  include  among other provisions all investments must be rated as investment grade by a recognized rating agency  investment securities from a single issuer that is not guaranteed by the good faith and credit of the united states government is limited to expected maturity is limited to months and the average maturity of the portfolio is limited to months  and derivatives  synthetics or similar instruments and instruments accounted for off balance sheet are specifically prohibited without prior authorization from the board of directors 
consistent with general market conditions  our investment portfolio is subject to credit and interest rate risks with the investment securities held 
we manage our investments pursuant to provisions of our cash and investment policy  in an effort to minimize exposures to credit quality  changes in credit quality  and individual security positions 
since our portfolio is comprised of income generating securities yielding returns based on stated interest rates  as interest rates change our portfolio value may change materially and future rates of return may diminish as interest rates decline 
we do not use derivative or other instruments to hedge our risks associated with changes in interest rates 
management has reviewed the composition of the investment portfolio and believes that as of december   the portfolio was in compliance with the cash and investment policy 
additionally  subsequent to december   all auction rate securities were liquidated at regularly scheduled auctions  and no losses were realized
