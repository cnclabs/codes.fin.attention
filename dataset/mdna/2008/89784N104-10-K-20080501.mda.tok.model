critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the ate of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the period 
our management bases its estimates on historical experience  and on other factors and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights the policies management feels are critical 
for a summary of all our critical accounting policies  including those discussed below see note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
sales recognition sales are recognized across all segments of the business when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  price has been fixed or is determinable  and collectibility can be reasonably assured 
sales within our us and international wholesale segments are recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers 
sales are recorded net of estimates of returns  discounts  operational chargebacks and markdowns 
returns and allowances require pre approval from management and discounts are based on trade terms 
we review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis 
our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results 
retail store sales are recognized net of estimated returns at the time of sale to consumers 
e commerce sales of products ordered through our retail internet site known as www 
truereligionbrandjeans 
com are recognized upon estimated delivery and receipt of the shipment by its customers 
sales also are reduced by an estimate of returns 
revenue from licensing arrangement is recognized when earned in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements  generally based upon the higher of a contractually guaranteed minimum royalty levels and b estimates of sales and royalty data received from our licensees 
sales returns and allowances a significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net income is estimating the portion of revenues that are not realizable 
in particular  wholesale revenue is reduced by estimates of returns  discounts  operational charge backs and markdowns 
retail revenue  including e commerce sales  also is reduced by estimates of returns 
in determining estimates of returns  discounts  and operational charge backs  our management analyzes historical trends  seasonal results  and current economic and market conditions 
we review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis 
our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results 
uncollectible accounts our us wholesale segment sells to merchant factors the accounts receivable that merchant factors has approved for credit 
merchant factors assumes the credit risk for these receivables 
we sold receivables of million to merchant factors in at times  our customers place orders that exceed the credit that they have available from the factor 
we evaluate those orders to consider if the customer is worthy of additional credit based on our past experience with the customer 
in the event we elect to sell merchandise to the customer on credit  we take the credit risk for the amounts that are above the credit limit established with the factor 
as of december   the amount of due from factor for which we bear the credit risk is million 
also  we extend credit to wholesale customers that satisfy our defined credit criteria 
management evaluates our accounts receivables to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
in performing this evaluation  significant judgments and estimates are made  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for larger accounts and customers 
based on this information  management provides a reserve for the estimated amounts believed to be uncollectible 
although our management believes that our major customers are sound and creditworthy  a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales  cash flows and or financial condition 
inventories wholesale and consumer direct inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined using the average cost method 
slow moving merchandise can typically be sold at prices exceeding our cost in our outlet retail stores or to wholesale customers who specialize in off price merchandise 
we have not recorded inventory write downs in the past 
our denim manufacturing process includes two phases i cut and sew  and ii washing and finishing 
at times we will instruct our contract manufacturers to send goods to us that have been completed through the cut and sew phase only 
by delaying the second phase of the manufacturing process  we can use updated market information about which washes and finishes are most popular before it sends these unwashed goods to the laundries and finishing houses to complete the manufacturing process 
the denim products that we hold between the cut and sew phase and the wash and finish phase are considered work in progress 
stock based compensation stock options effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r  which requires us to measure the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the costs are recognized over the period during which an employee or director is required to provide services in exchange for the award 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we applied accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  to measure compensation costs for its stock based compensation programs 
under apb  we recorded no compensation expense for stock options granted to employees and directors if the options strike price was equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date 
if the option price was below the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date  we recognized compensation expense over the stock option s vesting period 
also  the vesting terms for some stock options granted in were later accelerated which resulted in compensation expense in some cases 
for stock options granted to employees and directors where the options strike price was below the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date  compensation expense was recognized for the difference between the strike price and the closing market price our common stock on the grant date 
through  we presented the effect on net earnings and earnings per share of the fair value provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method 
under this accounting method  stock based compensation expense considered the unvested portion of all stock options outstanding  calculated using the provisions of sfas no 
as provided for under the modified prospective method  we did not restate our results for the periods prior to restricted stock compensation we recognize restricted stock compensation expense using the straight line method over the requisite service period of the entire award 
the requisite service period is the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for an award  which often is the vesting period 
if a portion of the restricted stock vests immediately or in another period such that the cumulative expected vested amount exceeds the cumulative straight line expense amount  we record compensation expense equal to at least the cumulative compensation expense of the expected vested amount of the restricted stock 
leases we lease all of our branded retail stores and our corporate headquarters 
we recognize lease expense on a straight line basis over the minimum lease term 
for leases that contain rent holiday periods and scheduled rent increases  we record a liability for the difference between the lease expense and the amount payable under the leases 
in some lease agreements we receive incentives to set up our stores in certain developments 
these incentives are recorded as a deferred rent and recognized as a reduction to rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease term 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas fsp and fasb staff position no 
fas fsp fas  affecting implementation of sfas fsp fas excludes fasb statement no 
 accounting for leases sfas  and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements under sfas  from the scope of sfas fsp fas delays the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized at fair value on a recurring basis  to fiscal years beginning after november  for all other items  sfas was effective for the company as of january  we have adopted sfas as amended by fsp fas and fsp fas as of january  the adoption will not have a material affect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
fas permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas was effective for the company as of january  we do not expect to change the measurement of our assets and liabilities as a result of sfas therefore  sfas will have no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r will significantly change the accounting for business combinations 
under sfas r  an acquiring entity will be required to recognize all the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a transaction at the acquisition date fair value with limited exceptions 
sfas r will change the accounting treatment for certain specific acquisition related items including expensing acquisition related costs as incurred  valuing non controlling interest minority interests at fair value at the acquisition date  and expensing restructuring costs associated with an acquired business 
sfas r also includes a substantial number of new disclosure requirements 
sfas r is to be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  early adoption is not permitted 
generally  the effect of sfas r will depend on future acquisitions  if any

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk exchange rate risk we received united states dollars usd for all product sales and licensing revenue during the year ended december  inventory purchases from contract manufacturers are denominated in usd 
marketable securities our investments in marketable securities may consist of united states government and government agency bonds  auction rate securities and commercial paper 
auction rate securities are variable rate bonds whose interest rate is periodically reset  typically every   or days 
the underlying securities have contractual maturities from through the auction rate securities are classified as available for sale in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and are recorded at fair value 
any unrealized gains or temporary unrealized losses  if any  are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company assesses whether an other than temporary impairment loss on an investment has occurred due to declines in fair value or other market conditions 
at december  and  the company does not believe any unrealized losses represent other than temporary impairments based on its evaluation of available evidence as of these dates 
we have the ability to hold such securities long term 
as of december   we held million of auction rate securities 
a total of million of these securities are collateralized by higher education funded student loans  million par amount of which are supported by federal government as part of the federal family education loan program ffelp 
the dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined calendar intervals is intended to provide liquidity to the holder of the auction rate securities by matching buyers and sellers within a market context enabling the holder to gain immediate liquidity by selling such interests at par or rolling over their investment 
if there is an imbalance between buyers and sellers the risk of a failed auction exists 
we had not experienced a failed auction for any of our securities as of december  however  we had eight issues fail at auction in february  march  and april with a total par value of million 
given the deteriorating credit markets and the increased incidence of failure within the auction market  there can be no assurances as to when we will be able to liquidate a particular issue 
in such case of a failure we would not be able to access those funds until a future auction of these investments is successful  the security is called by the issuer or a buyer is found outside of the auction process 
furthermore  if this situation were to persist despite our ability to hold such investments for the long term  we may be required to record an impairment charge at a future date 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate these investments as there is no assurance as to when  or if  the market for this investment class will return to orderly operations 
as such  we anticipate that the anticipated recovery period for these investments may be longer than twelve months and as a result we have reclassified million of these investments from short term to long term marketable securities at december  all short term marketable securities at december  were sold and converted to cash equivalents subsequent to december
