item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this activity constitutes a separate operating segment for financial reporting purposes  which is designated other non regulated 
employees at december   phi had  employees  including  employed by pepco  employed by dpl  employed by ace and  employed by phi service company 
the balance were employed by phi s competitive energy and other non regulated businesses 
approximately  employees including  employed by pepco  employed by dpl  employed by ace  employed by phi service company  and employed by conectiv energy are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various locals of the international brotherhood of electrical workers 
environmental matters phi  through its subsidiaries  is subject to regulation by various federal  regional  state  and local authorities with respect to the environmental effects of its operations  including air and water quality control  solid and hazardous waste disposal  and limitations on land use 
in addition  federal and state statutes authorize governmental agencies to compel responsible parties to clean up certain abandoned or unremediated hazardous waste sites 
phi s subsidiaries may incur costs to clean up currently or formerly owned facilities or sites found to be contaminated  as well as other facilities or sites that may have been contaminated due to past disposal practices 
phi s subsidiaries currently projected capital expenditures plan for the replacement of existing or installation of new environmental control facilities that are necessary for compliance with environmental laws  rules or agency orders by its subsidiaries are million in and million in the actual costs of environmental compliance may be materially different from this capital expenditures plan depending on the outcome of the matters addressed below or as a result of the imposition of additional environmental requirements or new or different interpretations of existing environmental laws and regulations 
the projected capital expenditures for and include million and million  respectively  of expenditures to comply with multipollutant regulations adopted by the delaware department of natural resources and environmental control dnrec 
conectiv energy has appealed these regulations  as described below 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and liquidity capital requirements compliance with delaware multipollutant regulations 
the million in expected expenditures in and for compliance with the multipollutant regulations is only a portion of the total capital expenditures of million  which phi currently estimates will be necessary for multipollutant regulation compliance over the long term 
air quality regulation the generating facilities and operations of phi s subsidiaries are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations  including the federal clean air act caa  which limit emissions of air pollutants  require permits for operation of facilities and impose recordkeeping and reporting requirements 
sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxide  mercury and nickel emissions among other things  the acid rain provisions of the caa regulate total sulfur dioxide so emissions from affected generating units and allocate allowances to each affected unit that permit the unit to emit a specified amount of so the generating facilities of phi s subsidiaries that require so allowances use allocated allowances or allowances acquired  as necessary  in the open market to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements 
also under current regulations implementing caa standards  each of the states in which phi subsidiaries own and operate generating units regulate nitrogen oxide nox emissions from generating units and allocate nox allowances 
most of the generating units operated by phi subsidiaries are subject to nox emission limits 
these units use allocated allowances or allowances purchased in the open market as necessary to achieve compliance with these regulations 
in  the us environmental protection agency epa issued its clean air interstate rule cair  which imposes additional reductions of so and nox emissions from electric generating units in eastern states and the district of columbia  including each of the states in which phi subsidiaries own and operate generating units 
cair uses an allowance system to cap state wide emissions of so and nox in two stages beginning in for nox and for so states may implement cair by adopting epa s trading program or through regulations that at a minimum achieve the reductions that would be achieved through implementation of epa s program 
each state covered by cair may determine independently which emission sources to control and which control measures to adopt 
cair includes model rules for multi state cap and trade programs for power plants that states may choose to adopt to meet the required emissions reductions 
these regulations may require installation of pollution control devices and or fuel modifications for generating units owned by conectiv energy and pepco energy services 
the states in which phi subsidiaries own and operate generating units have adopted  or are in the process of adopting  regulations to implement cair which will require  beginning in  the surrender of a nox annual allowance for each ton of nox emitted during the year and  beginning in  will require the surrender of more than one so allowance for each ton of so emitted 
to implement cair  the new jersey department of environmental protection njdep in june adopted a new nox trading program that will replace the existing nox trading program in this new trading program will allocate nox annual and nox ozone season allowances to conectiv energy s carll s corner  cedar  middle  mickleton  cumberland and sherman generating units  and will operate in a manner similar to njdep s existing nox trading program 
conectiv energy s edge moor  christiana and hay road generating units in delaware will be subject to federal cair for nox and so pennsylvania is expected to promulgate cair regulations in that will be applicable to conectiv energy s bethlehem generating units and the generating units being constructed in peach bottom township  pennsylvania  known as the delta project 
virginia will implement cair by participating in epa s cap and trade program and conectiv energy s tasley peaking unit will be subject to cair requirements 
conectiv energy s maryland generating units are smaller than cair s applicability threshold and therefore are not subject to cair 
pepco energy services benning road generating units located in the district of columbia will be subject to cair requirements 
however  it is not yet certain whether the district will adopt a state implementation plan or whether the district will rely on the federal program 
pepco energy services buzzard point generating units and its landfill gas generating units will not be subject to cair 
conectiv energy and pepco energy services units will use nox annual  nox ozone season and so allowances allocated or purchased in the open market as necessary to comply with cair 
although implementation of cair will increase costs for conectiv energy and pepco energy services units  phi currently does not anticipate that cair will have a significant impact on the operation of the affected generating units 
in  epa finalized its clean air mercury rule camr  which established mercury emissions standards for new or modified sources and capped state wide emissions of mercury beginning in the regulations  which permitted states to implement camr by adopting epa s market based cap and trade allowance program for coal fired utility boilers or through regulations that at a minimum achieve the reductions that would be achieved through epa s program  were vacated by the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in february in december  njdep published final rules regulating mercury emissions from power plants and industrial facilities in new jersey that impose standards  effective december   that are significantly stricter than epa s now vacated federal camr for coal fired plants 
conectiv energy has initiated a monitoring program at the deepwater generating facility  its only coal fired generating plant in new jersey  in order to show compliance with njdep s mercury regulations 
on november   dnrec adopted regulations to require large coal fired and residual oil fired electric generating units to develop control strategies to address air quality in delaware 
these control strategies are intended to assure attainment of ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particulate matter  address local scale fine particulate emission problems  reduce mercury emissions  satisfy the now vacated federal camr rule  improve visibility and help satisfy delaware s regional haze obligations 
for conectiv energy s edge moor coal fired units  these multipollutant regulations establish stringent short term emission limits for emissions of nox  so and mercury  and for edge moor s residual oil fired generating unit  impose more stringent sulfur in fuel limits and establish stringent short term emission limits for nox emissions 
the regulations also cap annual emissions of nox and so from edge moor s coal fired and residual oil fired units  and mercury from edge moor s coal fired units 
compliance with the regulations will require the installation of new pollution control equipment and or the enhancement of existing equipment  and may require the imposition of restrictions on the operation of those units 
conectiv energy submitted a compliance plan for its facilities to dnrec in june conectiv energy estimates that it will cost up to million to install the control equipment necessary to comply with the regulations 
these estimated costs do not include increased costs associated with operating control equipment 
in december  conectiv energy filed a complaint with the delaware superior court seeking review of dnrec s adoption of the regulations 
the appeal is pending 
in a march rulemaking  epa removed coal and oil fired units from the list of source categories requiring maximum achievable control technology for hazardous air pollutants such as mercury and nickel under caa section  thus  for the time being  eliminating the possibility that control devices would be required under this section of the caa to reduce nickel emissions from the oil fired unit at conectiv energy s edge moor generating facility 
in the decision issued on february   the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit determined that the delisting of coal and oil fired units from regulation under caa section was unlawful 
carbon dioxide emissions delaware  maryland and new jersey along with connecticut  maine  massachusetts  new hampshire  rhode island  vermont and new york are signatories to the regional greenhouse gas initiative rggi 
under rggi  each of the participating states has committed to the adoption of legislation or regulations designed to stabilize and eventually reduce emissions of carbon dioxide co emissions  including the implementation of a regional co budget and allowance trading program to regulate emissions from fossil fuel fired power plants 
the regulations implementing this program are expected to require fossil fuel fired electric generating units commencing in to hold co allowances equivalent to their historic baseline co emissions and to reduce co emissions incrementally beginning in to achieve an overall reduction from baseline by each state is permitted to adopt its own regulations and can develop its own allowance allocation auction mechanisms 
until delaware  maryland and new jersey adopt regulations  phi will not be in a position to determine whether the allowances allocated to the generating facilities operated by its subsidiaries will be sufficient to cover the co emissions from those facilities  the financial impact of acquiring allowances through auction  or the potential financial and operational consequences of the regulations 
in february  the new jersey governor signed an executive order which requires new jersey to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to levels by  and to below levels by the executive order requires njdep to coordinate with njbpu  new jersey s department of transportation  new jersey s department of community affairs and other interested parties to evaluate policies and measures that will enable new jersey to achieve the greenhouse gas emissions reduction levels set forth in the executive order 
in july  new jersey enacted legislation requiring njdep to promulgate regulations by july  that establish a greenhouse gas emissions monitoring and reporting program to evaluate progress toward the and greenhouse gas limits 
in january  new jersey enacted legislation requiring the njdep to develop regulations for a trading program for co allowances to be created under rggi 
regulatory actions in delaware and maryland implementing co regulations are expected in water quality regulation provisions of the federal water pollution control act  also known as the clean water act cwa  establish the basic legal structure for regulating the discharge of pollutants from point sources to surface waters of the united states 
among other things  the cwa requires that any person wishing to discharge pollutants from a point source generally a confined  discrete conveyance such as a pipe obtain a national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes permit issued by epa or by a state agency under a federally authorized state program 
all of the steam generating facilities operated by phi s subsidiaries have npdes permits authorizing their pollutant discharges which are subject to periodic renewal 
in july  epa issued final regulations under section b of the cwa that are intended to minimize potential adverse environmental impacts from power plant cooling water intake structures on aquatic resources by establishing performance based standards for the operation of these structures at large existing electric generating plants  including conectiv energy s deepwater and edge moor generating facilities 
these regulations may require changes to cooling water intake structures as part of the npdes permit renewal process 
in january  the us court of appeals for the second circuit issued a decision in riverkeeper  inc v 
united states environmental protection agency commonly known as the riverkeeper ii decision  that remanded to epa for additional rulemaking substantial portions of these regulations for large existing electric generating plants 
epa has not yet initiated the additional rulemaking 
petitions for review of the riverkeeper ii decision have been filed with the us supreme court by various interested parties 
the supreme court has not yet determined whether it will hear the appeal 
the capital expenditures  if any  that may be needed as a consequence of these regulations will not be known until these proceedings are concluded and until each affected facility completes additional studies and addresses related permit requirements 
epa has delegated authority to administer the npdes program to a number of state agencies including dnrec 
the npdes permit for conectiv energy s edge moor generating facility expired on october   but has been administratively extended until dnrec issues a renewal permit 
conectiv energy submitted a renewal application to the dnrec in april studies required under the existing permit to determine the impact on aquatic organisms of the plant s cooling water intake structures were completed in site specific alternative technologies and operational measures have been evaluated and discussed with dnrec 
dnrec  however  has not announced how it intends to address section b requirements in the renewal npdes permit in light of riverkeeper ii and the remand of substantial portions of the federal regulations under the new jersey water pollution control act  njdep implements regulations  administers the new jersey pollutant discharge elimination system njpdes program with epa oversight  and issues and enforces njpdes permits 
in june  conectiv energy filed a timely application for renewal of the njpdes permit for the deepwater generating facility 
timely filing of the application for renewal administratively extended the existing permit 
the previous njpdes permit for deepwater required that conectiv energy perform several studies to determine whether or not deepwater s cooling water intake structures satisfy applicable requirements for protection of the environment 
while those study requirements were consistent with requirements under epa s regulations implementing cwa section b  the result of the riverkeeper ii decision may require reevaluation of the design and operational measures that conectiv energy anticipated using for future compliance with section b at deepwater 
in view of the uncertainty associated with riverkeeper ii  conectiv energy asked njdep to modify or stay a cooling water intake structure design upgrade requirement in deepwater s njpdes permit  and njdep agreed to stay that permit requirement 
pepco and a subsidiary of pepco energy services discharge water from a steam generating plant and service center located in the district of columbia under a npdes permit issued by epa in november pepco filed a petition with epa s environmental appeals board seeking review and reconsideration of certain provisions of epa s permit determination 
in may  pepco and epa reached a settlement on pepco s petition  under which epa withdrew certain contested provisions and agreed to issue a revised draft permit for public comment 
epa has not yet issued the revised draft permit 
a timely renewal application was filed in may and the companies are operating under the november permit  excluding the withdrawn conditions  in accordance with the settlement agreement 
on november   njdep adopted amendments to its regulations under the flood hazard area control act fhaca to minimize damage to life and property from flooding caused by development in flood plains 
the amended regulations impose a new regulatory program to mitigate flooding and related environmental impacts from a broad range of construction and development activities  including electric utility transmission and distribution construction that was previously unregulated under the fhaca and that is otherwise regulated under a number of other state and federal programs 
ace is evaluating whether to appeal the adoption of these regulations to the appellate division of the superior court of new jersey 
phi cannot predict at this time the costs of complying with the fhaca regulations due  among other things  to the possibility that njdep will issue exemptions from the new regulations 
in september  njdep proposed amendments to the agency s regulations under the freshwater wetlands protection act fwpa 
phi believes that these proposed amendments may hinder development of electric transmission and distribution systems by increasing the regulatory obstacles necessary to site public service infrastructure 
on december   ace filed comments concerning the proposed amendments  urging njdep not to change the manner in which the fwpa regulations presently apply to utility lines  poles  and other utility property 
an accurate estimate of phi s compliance costs is not feasible until the regulations are adopted 
in  epa amended its oil pollution prevention regulations to require facilities  that because of their location could reasonably be expected to discharge oil in quantities that may be harmful to the environment  to amend and implement spill prevention  control  and countermeasure spcc plans and facility response plans frps by february since  epa has provided a number of extensions to the compliance deadline 
as a result of those extensions  phi facilities subject to the regulations must now comply with these regulatory requirements by july  phi has undertaken an analysis of its facilities to identify equipment sites for which physical modifications are necessary to reduce the risk of a release of oil and comply with epa s spcc and frp regulations 
physical modification of facilities through the construction of containment structures or replacement of oil filled equipment with non oil filled equipment is scheduled from through with an anticipated cost of approximately million 
hazardous substance regulation the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of cercla  authorizes epa  and comparable state laws authorize state environmental authorities  to issue orders and bring enforcement actions to compel responsible parties to investigate and take remedial actions at any site that is determined to present an actual or potential threat to human health or the environment because of an actual or threatened release of one or more hazardous substances 
parties that generated or transported hazardous substances to such sites  as well as the owners and operators of such sites  may be deemed liable under cercla or comparable state laws 
pepco  dpl and ace each has been named by epa or a state environmental agency as a potentially responsible party at certain contaminated sites 
see note  commitments and contingencies legal proceedings environmental litigation to the consolidated financial statements of phi included in item in addition  dpl and ace have undertaken efforts to remediate currently or formerly owned facilities found to be contaminated  including two former manufactured gas plant sites and other owned property

item a 
risk factors the businesses of phi  pepco  dpl and ace are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including the events or conditions identified below 
the occurrence of one or more of these events or conditions could have an adverse effect on the business of any one or more of the companies  including  depending on the circumstances  its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
unless otherwise noted  each risk factor set forth below applies to each of phi  pepco  dpl and ace 
phi and its subsidiaries are subject to substantial governmental regulation  and unfavorable regulatory treatment could have a negative effect 
phi s power delivery businesses are subject to regulation by various federal  state and local regulatory agencies that significantly affects their operations 
each of pepco  dpl and ace is regulated by state regulatory agencies in its service territories  with respect to  among other things  the rates it can charge retail customers for the supply and distribution of electricity and additionally for dpl the supply and distribution of natural gas 
in addition  the rates that the companies can charge for electricity transmission are regulated by ferc  and dpl s natural gas transportation is regulated by ferc 
the companies cannot change supply  distribution  or transmission rates without approval by the applicable regulatory authority 
while the approved distribution and transmission rates are intended to permit the companies to recover their costs of service and earn a reasonable rate of return  the profitability of the companies is affected by the rates they are able to charge 
in addition  if the costs incurred by any of the companies in operating its transmission and distribution facilities exceed the allowed amounts for costs included in the approved rates  the financial results of that company  and correspondingly  phi  will be adversely affected 
phi s subsidiaries also are required to have numerous permits  approvals and certificates from governmental agencies that regulate their businesses 
phi believes that each of its subsidiaries has  and each of pepco  dpl and ace believes it has  obtained or sought renewal of the material permits  approvals and certificates necessary for its existing operations and that its business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws  however  none of the companies is able to predict the impact of future regulatory activities of any of these agencies on its business 
changes in or reinterpretations of existing laws or regulations  or the imposition of new laws or regulations  may require any one or more of phi s subsidiaries to incur additional expenses or significant capital expenditures or to change the way it conducts its operations 
pepco may be required to make additional divestiture proceeds gain sharing payments to customers in the district of columbia and maryland 
phi and pepco only pepco currently is involved in regulatory proceedings in maryland and the district of columbia related to the sharing of the net proceeds from the sale of its generation related assets 
the principal issue in the proceedings is whether pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes and accumulated deferred investment tax credits associated with the sold assets and  if so  whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the internal revenue code and its implementing regulations 
depending on the outcome of the proceedings  pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to customers and payments to the internal revenue service irs in the amount of the associated accumulated deferred investment tax credits  and pepco might be unable to use accelerated depreciation on district of columbia and maryland allocated or assigned property 
see item phi management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory and other matters divestiture cases for additional information 
the operating results of the power delivery business and the competitive energy businesses fluctuate on a seasonal basis and can be adversely affected by changes in weather 
the power delivery business is seasonal and weather patterns can have a material impact on their operating performance 
demand for electricity is generally higher in the summer months associated with cooling and demand for electricity and natural gas is generally higher in the winter months associated with heating as compared to other times of the year 
accordingly  each of phi  pepco  dpl and ace has generated less revenue and income when temperatures are warmer than normal in the winter and cooler than normal in the summer 
in maryland  however  the decoupling of distribution revenue for a given reporting period  from the amount of power delivered during the period as the result of the adoption by the mpsc of a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism for retail customers  has had the effect of eliminating changes in customer usage due to weather conditions or for other reasons as a factor having an impact on reported revenue and income 
historically  the competitive energy operations of conectiv energy and pepco energy services also have produced less revenue when weather conditions are milder than normal  which can negatively impact phi s income from these operations 
the competitive energy businesses energy management services generally are not seasonal 
facilities may not operate as planned or may require significant maintenance expenditures  which could decrease revenues or increase expenses 
operation of the pepco  dpl and ace transmission and distribution facilities and the competitive energy businesses generation facilities involves many risks  including the breakdown or failure of equipment  accidents  labor disputes and performance below expected levels 
older facilities and equipment  even if maintained in accordance with sound engineering practices  may require significant capital expenditures for additions or upgrades to keep them operating at peak efficiency  to comply with changing environmental requirements  or to provide reliable operations 
natural disasters and weather related incidents  including tornadoes  hurricanes and snow and ice storms  also can disrupt generation  transmission and distribution delivery systems 
operation of generation  transmission and distribution facilities below expected capacity levels can reduce revenues and result in the incurrence of additional expenses that may not be recoverable from customers or through insurance  including deficiency charges imposed by pjm on generation facilities at a rate up to two times the capacity payment price which the generation facility receives 
furthermore  if the company owning the facilities is unable to perform its contractual obligations for any of these reasons  that company  and correspondingly phi  may incur penalties or damages 
the transmission facilities of the power delivery business are interconnected with the facilities of other transmission facility owners whose actions could have a negative impact on operations 
the electricity transmission facilities of pepco  dpl and ace are directly interconnected with the transmission facilities of contiguous utilities and  as such  are part of an interstate power transmission grid 
ferc has designated a number of regional transmission organizations to coordinate the operation of portions of the interstate transmission grid 
pepco  dpl and ace are members of the pjm rto 
in  ferc approved pjm as the sole provider of transmission service in the pjm rto region  which today consists of all or parts of delaware  illinois  indiana  kentucky  maryland  michigan  new jersey  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  tennessee  virginia  west virginia and the district of columbia 
pepco  dpl and ace operate their transmission facilities under the direction and control of pjm 
pjm rto and the other regional transmission organizations have established sophisticated systems that are designed to ensure the reliability of the operation of transmission facilities and prevent the operations of one utility from having an adverse impact on the operations of the other utilities 
however  the systems put in place by pjm rto and the other regional transmission organizations may not always be adequate to prevent problems at other utilities from causing service interruptions in the transmission facilities of pepco  dpl or ace 
if any of pepco  dpl or ace were to suffer such a service interruption  it could have a negative impact on it and on phi 
the cost of compliance with environmental laws  including laws relating to emissions of greenhouse gases  is significant and new environmental laws may increase expenses 
the operations of phi s subsidiaries  including pepco  dpl and ace  are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental statutes  rules and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  spill prevention  waste management  natural resources  site remediation  and health and safety 
these laws and regulations can require significant capital and other expenditures to  among other things  meet emissions standards  conduct site remediation and perform environmental monitoring 
if a company fails to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations  even if caused by factors beyond its control  such failure could result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and liabilities and the need to expend significant sums to come into compliance 
in addition  phi s subsidiaries are required to obtain and comply with a variety of environmental permits  licenses  inspections and other approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approval  or if there is a failure to obtain  maintain or comply with any such approval  operations at affected facilities could be halted or subjected to additional costs 
there is growing concern at the federal and state levels about co and other greenhouse gas emissions 
as a result  it is possible that state and federal regulations will be developed that will impose more stringent limitations on emissions than are currently in effect 
any of these factors could result in increased capital expenditures and or operating costs for one or more generating plants operated by phi s conectiv energy and pepco energy services businesses 
until specific regulations are promulgated  the impact that any new environmental regulations  voluntary compliance guidelines  enforcement initiatives  or legislation may have on the results of operations  financial position or liquidity of phi and its subsidiaries is not determinable 
phi  pepco  dpl and ace each continues to monitor federal and state activity related to environmental matters in order to analyze their potential operational and cost implications 
new environmental laws and regulations  or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations  could impose more stringent limitations on the operations of phi s subsidiaries or require them to incur significant additional costs 
current compliance strategies may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future 
failure to retain and attract key skilled professional and technical employees could have an adverse effect on the operations 
the ability of each of phi and its subsidiaries  including pepco  dpl and ace  to implement its business strategy is dependent on its ability to recruit  retain and motivate employees 
competition for skilled employees in some areas is high and the inability to retain and attract these employees could adversely affect the company s business  operations and financial condition 
phi s competitive energy businesses are highly competitive 
phi only the unregulated energy generation  supply and marketing businesses primarily in the mid atlantic region are characterized by intense competition at both the wholesale and retail levels 
phi s competitive energy businesses compete with numerous non utility generators  independent power producers  wholesale and retail energy marketers  and traditional utilities 
this competition generally has the effect of reducing margins and requires a continual focus on controlling costs 
phi s competitive energy businesses rely on some generation  transmission  storage  and distribution assets that they do not own or control to deliver wholesale and retail electricity and natural gas and to obtain fuel for their generation facilities 
phi only phi s competitive energy businesses depend upon electric generation and transmission facilities  natural gas pipelines  and natural gas storage facilities owned and operated by others 
the operation of their generation facilities also depends upon coal  natural gas or diesel fuel supplied by others 
if electric generation or transmission  natural gas pipelines  or natural gas storage are disrupted or capacity is inadequate or unavailable  the competitive energy businesses ability to buy and receive and or sell and deliver wholesale and retail power and natural gas  and therefore to fulfill their contractual obligations  could be adversely affected 
similarly  if the fuel supply to one or more of their generation plants is disrupted and storage or other alternative sources of supply are not available  the competitive energy businesses ability to operate their generating facilities could be adversely affected 
changes in technology may adversely affect the power delivery business and phi s competitive energy businesses 
research and development activities are ongoing to improve alternative technologies to produce electricity  including fuel cells  micro turbines and photovoltaic solar cells 
it is possible that advances in these or other alternative technologies will reduce the costs of electricity production from these technologies  thereby making the generating facilities of phi s competitive energy businesses less competitive 
in addition  increased conservation efforts and advances in technology could reduce demand for electricity supply and distribution  which could adversely affect the power delivery businesses of pepco  dpl and ace and phi s competitive energy businesses 
changes in technology also could alter the channels through which retail electric customers buy electricity  which could adversely affect the power delivery businesses of pepco  dpl and ace 
phi s risk management procedures may not prevent losses in the operation of its competitive energy businesses 
phi only the operations of phi s competitive energy businesses are conducted in accordance with sophisticated risk management systems that are designed to quantify risk 
however  actual results sometimes deviate from modeled expectations 
in particular  risks in phi s energy activities are measured and monitored utilizing value at risk models to determine the effects of potential one day favorable or unfavorable price movements 
these estimates are based on historical price volatility and assume a normal distribution of price changes and a probability of occurrence 
consequently  if prices significantly deviate from historical prices  phi s risk management systems  including assumptions supporting risk limits  may not protect phi from significant losses 
in addition  adverse changes in energy prices may result in economic losses in phi s earnings and cash flows and reductions in the value of assets on its balance sheet under applicable accounting rules 
the commodity hedging procedures used by phi s competitive energy businesses may not protect them from significant losses caused by volatile commodity prices 
phi only to lower the financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations  phi s competitive energy businesses routinely enter into contracts to hedge the value of their assets and operations 
as part of this strategy  phi s competitive energy businesses utilize fixed price  forward  physical purchase and sales contracts  tolling agreements  futures  financial swaps and option contracts traded in the over the counter markets or on exchanges 
each of these various hedge instruments can present a unique set of risks in its application to phi s energy assets 
phi must apply judgment in determining the application and effectiveness of each hedge instrument 
changes in accounting rules  or revised interpretations to existing rules  may cause hedges to be deemed ineffective as an accounting matter 
this could have material earnings implications for the period or periods in question 
conectiv energy s objective is to hedge a portion of the expected power output of its generation facilities and the costs of fuel used to operate those facilities so it is not completely exposed to energy price movements 
hedge targets are approved by phi s corporate risk management committee and may change from time to time based on market conditions 
conectiv energy generally establishes hedge targets annually for the next three succeeding month periods 
within a given month horizon  the actual hedged positioning in any month may be outside of the targeted range  even if the average for a month period falls within the stated range 
management exercises judgment in determining which months present the most significant risk  or opportunity  and hedge levels are adjusted accordingly 
since energy markets can move significantly in a short period of time  hedge levels may also be adjusted to reflect revised assumptions 
such factors may include  but are not limited to  changes in projected plant output  revisions to fuel requirements  transmission constraints  prices of alternate fuels  and improving or deteriorating supply and demand conditions 
in addition  short term occurrences  such as abnormal weather  operational events  or intra month commodity price volatility may also cause the actual level of hedging coverage to vary from the established hedge targets 
these events can cause fluctuations in phi s earnings from period to period 
due to the high heat rate of the pepco energy services generating facilities  pepco energy services generally does not enter into wholesale contracts to lock in the forward value of its plants 
to the extent that phi s competitive energy businesses have unhedged positions or their hedging procedures do not work as planned  fluctuating commodity prices could result in significant losses 
conversely  by engaging in hedging activities  phi may not realize gains that otherwise could result from fluctuating commodity prices 
business operations could be adversely affected by terrorism 
the threat of  or actual acts of  terrorism may affect the operations of phi or any of its subsidiaries in unpredictable ways and may cause changes in the insurance markets  force an increase in security measures and cause disruptions of fuel supplies and markets 
if any of its infrastructure facilities  such as its electric generation  fuel storage  transmission or distribution facilities  were to be a direct target  or an indirect casualty  of an act of terrorism  the operations of phi  pepco  dpl or ace could be adversely affected 
corresponding instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism also could adversely affect the ability to raise needed capital 
insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all casualty losses that the companies might incur 
phi and its subsidiaries  including pepco  dpl and ace  currently have insurance coverage for their facilities and operations in amounts and with deductibles that they consider appropriate 
however  there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
in addition  some risks  such as weather related casualties  may not be insurable 
in the case of loss or damage to property  plant or equipment  there is no assurance that the insurance proceeds  if any  received will be sufficient to cover the entire cost of replacement or repair 
revenues  profits and cash flows may be adversely affected by economic conditions 
periods of slowed economic activity generally result in decreased demand for power  particularly by industrial and large commercial customers 
as a consequence  recessions or other downturns in the economy may result in decreased revenues and cash flows for the power delivery businesses of pepco  dpl and ace and phi s competitive energy businesses 
the irs challenge to cross border energy sale and lease back transactions entered into by a phi subsidiary could result in loss of prior and future tax benefits 
phi only pci maintains a portfolio of cross border energy sale leaseback transactions  which as of december   had a book value of approximately billion and from which phi currently derives approximately million per year in tax benefits in the form of interest and depreciation deductions 
on february   the treasury department and irs issued a notice informing taxpayers that the irs intends to challenge the tax benefits claimed by taxpayers with respect to certain of these transactions 
as part of the normal phi tax audit for and  the irs disallowed the tax benefits claimed by phi with respect to these leases for those years 
the tax benefits claimed by phi with respect to these leases from through december  were approximately million 
phi has filed a protest against the irs adjustments and the unresolved audit has been forwarded to the irs appeals office 
if the irs prevails  phi would be subject to additional taxes  along with interest and possibly penalties on the additional taxes  which could have a material adverse effect on phi s results of operations and cash flows 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulatory and other matters federal tax treatment of cross border leases for additional information 
changes in tax law could have a material adverse effect on the tax benefits that phi realizes from the portfolio of cross border energy sale leaseback transactions entered into by one of its subsidiaries 
in recent years  efforts have been made by members of the us senate to pass legislation that would have the effect of deferring the deduction of losses associated with leveraged lease transactions involving tax indifferent parties for taxable years beginning after the year of enactment regardless of when the transaction was entered into 
these proposals  which would affect transactions such as those included in pci s portfolio of cross border energy leases  would effectively defer the deduction of losses associated with such leveraged lease transactions until the taxable year in which the taxpayer recognized taxable income from the lease  which is typically toward the end of the lease term 
to date  no such legislation has been enacted  however  there are continuing efforts by members of the us senate to add legislation to various senate bills directed to the deferral or other curtailment of the tax benefits realized from such transactions 
enactment of legislation of this nature could result in a material delay of the income tax benefits that phi would receive in connection with pci s portfolio of cross border energy leases 
furthermore  if legislation of this type were enacted  under the financial accounting standards board staff position on financial accounting standard  phi would be required to adjust the book value of the leases and record a charge to earnings equal to the repricing impact of the deferred deductions which could result in a material adverse effect on phi s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
irs revenue ruling on mixed service costs could require phi to incur additional tax and interest payments in connection with the irs audit of this issue for the tax years through irs revenue ruling 
during  pepco  dpl and ace changed their methods of accounting with respect to capitalizable construction costs for income tax purposes 
the change allowed the companies to accelerate the deduction of certain expenses that were previously capitalized and depreciated 
through december   these accelerated deductions generated incremental tax cash flow benefits of approximately million consisting of million for pepco  million for dpl and million for ace for the companies  primarily attributable to their tax returns 
in  the treasury department issued proposed regulations that  if adopted in their current form  would require pepco  dpl and ace to change their method of accounting with respect to capitalizable construction costs for income tax purposes for future tax periods beginning in based on the proposed regulations  phi in its federal tax return adopted an alternative method of accounting for capitalizable construction costs that management believes will be acceptable to the irs 
at the same time as the proposed regulations were released  the irs issued revenue ruling  which is intended to limit the ability of certain taxpayers to utilize the method of accounting for income tax purposes they utilized on their tax returns for and prior years with respect to capitalizable construction costs 
in line with this revenue ruling  the irs revenue agent s report for the and tax returns disallowed substantially all of the incremental tax benefits that pepco  dpl and ace had claimed on those returns by requiring the companies to capitalize and depreciate certain expenses rather than treat such expenses as current deductions 
phi has filed a protest against the irs adjustments and the issue is among the unresolved audit matters relating to the and audits pending before the appeals office 
in february  phi paid approximately million of taxes to cover the amount of additional taxes and interest that management estimated to be payable for the years through based on the method of tax accounting that phi  pursuant to the proposed regulations  adopted on its tax return 
however  if the irs is successful in requiring pepco  dpl and ace to capitalize and depreciate construction costs that result in a tax and interest assessment greater than management s estimate of million  phi will be required to pay additional taxes and interest only to the extent these adjustments exceed the million payment made in february phi and its subsidiaries are dependent on their ability to successfully access capital markets 
an inability to access capital may adversely affect their businesses 
phi  pepco  dpl and ace each rely on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity and to satisfy their capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from their operations 
capital market disruptions  or a downgrade in credit ratings  would increase the cost of borrowing or could adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets 
in addition  a reduction in phi s credit ratings could require phi or its subsidiaries to post additional collateral in connection with some of the competitive energy businesses wholesale marketing and financing activities 
disruptions to the capital markets could include  but are not limited to recession or an economic slowdown  the bankruptcy of one or more energy companies  significant increases in the prices for oil or other fuel  a terrorist attack or threatened attacks  or a significant transmission failure 
in accordance with the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of and the sec rules thereunder  phi s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting and is required to assess annually the effectiveness of these controls 
the inability to certify the effectiveness of these controls due to the identification of one or more material weaknesses in these controls also could increase financing costs or could adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets 
future defined benefit plan funding obligations are affected by assumptions regarding the valuation of phi s benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets  actual experience which varies from the assumptions could result in an obligation of phi  pepco  dpl or ace to make significant unplanned cash contributions to the retirement plan 
phi follows the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions in accounting for pension benefits under its non contributory defined benefit plan the phi retirement plan 
in addition  on december   phi implemented sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas no 
which requires that companies recognize a net liability or asset to report the funded status of their defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the balance sheet 
in accordance with these accounting standards  phi makes assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
changes in assumptions  such as the use of a different discount rate or expected return on plan assets  affect the calculation of projected benefit obligations pbo  accumulated benefit obligation abo  reported pension liability  regulated assets  or accumulated other comprehensive income on phi s consolidated balance sheet and on the balance sheets of pepco  dpl and ace  and reported annual net periodic pension benefit cost on phi s consolidated statement of earnings and on the statements of earnings of pepco  dpl and ace 
use of alternative assumptions could also impact the expected future cash funding requirements of phi  pepco  dpl and ace for the phi retirement plan if the plan did not meet the minimum funding requirements of the employment retirement income security act of erisa 
phi s cash flow  ability to pay dividends and ability to satisfy debt obligations depend on the performance of its operating subsidiaries 
phi s unsecured obligations are effectively subordinated to the liabilities and the outstanding preferred stock of its subsidiaries 
phi only phi is a holding company that conducts its operations entirely through its subsidiaries  and all of phi s consolidated operating assets are held by its subsidiaries 
accordingly  phi s cash flow  its ability to satisfy its obligations to creditors and its ability to pay dividends on its common stock are dependent upon the earnings of the subsidiaries and the distribution of such earnings to phi in the form of dividends 
the subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on any debt or equity securities issued by phi or to make any funds available for such payment 
because the claims of the creditors of phi s subsidiaries and the preferred stockholders of ace are superior to phi s entitlement to dividends  the unsecured debt and obligations of phi are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities of its subsidiaries and to the rights of the holders of ace s preferred stock to receive dividend payments 
energy companies are subject to adverse publicity which makes them vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes 
the energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of highly publicized allegations of misconduct in recent years 
in addition  many utility companies have been publicly criticized for their performance during natural disasters and weather related incidents 
adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures  regulatory authorities  and other government officials less likely to view energy companies such as phi and its subsidiaries in a favorable light  and may cause phi and its subsidiaries to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies 
provisions of the delaware general corporation law may discourage an acquisition of phi 
phi only as a delaware corporation  phi is subject to the business combination law set forth in section of the delaware general corporation law  which could have the effect of delaying  discouraging or preventing an acquisition of phi 
because pepco is a wholly owned subsidiary of phi  and each of dpl and ace are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of phi  phi can exercise substantial control over their dividend policies and businesses and operations 
pepco  dpl and ace only all of the members of each of pepco s  dpl s and ace s board of directors  as well as many of pepco s  dpl s and ace s executive officers  are officers of phi or an affiliate of phi 
among other decisions  each of pepco s  dpl s and ace s board is responsible for decisions regarding payment of dividends  financing and capital raising activities  and acquisition and disposition of assets 
within the limitations of applicable law  and subject to the financial covenants under each company s respective outstanding debt instruments  each of pepco s  dpl s and ace s board of directors will base its decisions concerning the amount and timing of dividends  and other business decisions  on the company s respective earnings  cash flow and capital structure  but may also take into account the business plans and financial requirements of phi and its other subsidiaries

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pepco holdings  inc 
general overview in  and  respectively  phi s power delivery operations produced   and of phi s consolidated operating revenues including revenues from intercompany transactions and   and of phi s consolidated operating income including income from intercompany transactions 
the power delivery business consists primarily of the transmission  distribution and default supply of electric power  which for   and  was responsible for   and  respectively  of power delivery s operating revenues 
the distribution of natural gas contributed  and of power delivery s operating revenues in  and  respectively 
power delivery represents one operating segment for financial reporting purposes 
the power delivery business is conducted by phi s three utility subsidiaries pepco  dpl and ace 
each of these companies is a regulated public utility in the jurisdictions that comprise its service territory 
each company is responsible for the delivery of electricity and  in the case of dpl  natural gas in its service territory  for which it is paid tariff rates established by the local public service commission 
each company also supplies electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its service territory who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive energy supplier 
the regulatory term for this supply service varies by jurisdiction as follows delaware provider of last resort service polr before may  standard offer service sos on and after may  district of columbia sos maryland sos new jersey basic generation service bgs virginia default service in this form k  these supply service obligations are referred to generally as default electricity supply 
pepco  dpl and ace are also responsible for the transmission of wholesale electricity into and across their service territories 
the rates each company is permitted to charge for the wholesale transmission of electricity are regulated by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
transmission rates are updated annually based on a ferc approved formula methodology 
the profitability of the power delivery business depends on its ability to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its capital investments through the rates it is permitted to charge 
power delivery s operating results are seasonal  generally producing higher revenue and income in the warmest and coldest periods of the year 
operating results also can be affected by economic conditions  energy prices and the impact of energy efficiency measures on customer usage of electricity 
effective june   the maryland public service commission mpsc approved new electric service distribution base rates for pepco and dpl the maryland rate order 
the mpsc also approved a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism bsa for retail customers 
see regulatory and other matters rate proceedings 
for customers to which the bsa applies  pepco and dpl recognize distribution revenue based on an approved distribution charge per customer 
from a revenue recognition standpoint  the bsa thus decouples the distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period 
this change in the reporting of distribution revenue has the effect of eliminating changes in customer usage whether due to weather conditions  energy prices  energy efficiency programs or other reasons as a factor having an impact on reported revenue 
as a consequence  the only factors that will cause distribution revenue to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer 
the competitive energy business provides competitive generation  marketing and supply of electricity and gas  and related energy management services primarily in the mid atlantic region 
these operations are conducted through subsidiaries of conectiv energy holding company collectively  conectiv energy and pepco energy services  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  pepco energy services  each of which is treated as a separate operating segment for financial reporting purposes 
for the years ended december   and  the operating revenues of the competitive energy business including revenue from intercompany transactions were equal to   and  respectively  of phi s consolidated operating revenues  and the operating income of the competitive energy business including operating income from intercompany transactions was   and of phi s consolidated operating income for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  amounts equal to   and respectively  of the operating revenues of the competitive energy business were attributable to electric energy and capacity  and natural gas sold to the power delivery segment 
conectiv energy provides wholesale electric power  capacity and ancillary services in the wholesale markets and also supplies electricity to other wholesale market participants under long and short term bilateral contracts 
conectiv energy supplies electric power to pepco  dpl and ace to satisfy a portion of their default electricity supply load  as well as default electricity supply load shares of other utilities within pjm rto and isone wholesale markets 
phi refers to these activities as merchant generation load service 
conectiv energy obtains the electricity required to meet its merchant generation load service power supply obligations from its own generation plants  bilateral contract purchases from other wholesale market participants  and purchases in the wholesale market 
conectiv energy also sells natural gas and fuel oil to very large end users and to wholesale market participants under bilateral agreements 
phi refers to these sales operations as energy marketing 
pepco energy services provides retail energy supply and energy services primarily to commercial  industrial  and governmental customers 
pepco energy services sells electricity and natural gas to customers primarily in the mid atlantic region 
pepco energy services provides energy savings performance contracting services  owns and operates two district energy systems  and designs  constructs and operates combined heat and power and central energy plants 
pepco energy services provides high voltage construction and maintenance services to customers throughout the us and low voltage electric construction and maintenance services and streetlight asset management services in the washington  dc area and owns and operates electric generating plants in washington  dc conectiv energy s primary objective is to maximize the value of its generation fleet by leveraging its operational and fuel flexibilities 
pepco energy services primary objective is to capture retail energy supply and service opportunities predominantly in the mid atlantic region 
the financial results of the competitive energy business can be significantly affected by wholesale and retail energy prices  the cost of fuel and gas to operate the conectiv energy plants  and the cost of purchased energy necessary to meet its power and gas supply obligations 
the competitive energy business  like the power delivery business  is seasonal  and therefore weather patterns can have a material impact on operating results 
through its subsidiary potomac capital investment corporation pci  phi maintains a portfolio of cross border energy sale leaseback transactions with a book value at december  of approximately billion 
this activity constitutes a fourth operating segment  which is designated as other non regulated  for financial reporting purposes 
for a discussion of phi s cross border leasing transactions  see regulatory and other matters federal income tax treatment of cross border leases in this management s discussion and analysis 
business strategy phi s business strategy is to remain a regional diversified energy delivery utility and competitive energy services company focused on value creation and operational excellence 
the components of this strategy include achieving earnings growth in the power delivery business by focusing on infrastructure investments and constructive regulatory outcomes  while maintaining a high level of operational excellence 
supplementing phi s utility earnings through competitive energy businesses that focus on serving the competitive wholesale and retail markets primarily in pjm rto 
pursuing technologies and practices that promote energy efficiency  energy conservation and the reduction of green house gas emissions 
in furtherance of this business strategy  phi may from time to time examine a variety of transactions involving its existing businesses  including the entry into joint ventures or the disposition of one or more businesses  as well as possible acquisitions 
phi also may reassess or refine the components of its business strategy as it deems necessary or appropriate in response to a wide variety of factors  including the requirements of its businesses  competitive conditions and regulatory requirements

conectiv energy the impact of operating revenue changes and fuel and purchased energy and other services cost of sales changes with respect to the conectiv energy component of the competitive energy business are encompassed within the discussion that follows 
operating revenues of the conectiv energy segment are derived primarily from the sale of electricity 
the primary components of its costs of sales are fuel and purchased power 
because fuel and electricity prices tend to move in tandem  price changes in these commodities from period to period can have a significant impact on operating revenue and costs of sales without signifying any change in the performance of the conectiv energy segment 
for this reason  phi from a managerial standpoint focuses on gross margin as a measure of performance 
conectiv energy gross margin merchant generation load service consists primarily of electric power  capacity and ancillary services sales from conectiv energy s generating plants  tolling arrangements entered into to sell energy and other products from conectiv energy s generating plants and to purchase energy and other products from generating plants of other companies  hedges of power  capacity  fuel and load  the sale of excess fuel primarily natural gas and emission allowances  electric power  capacity  and ancillary services sales pursuant to competitively bid contracts entered into with affiliated and non affiliated companies to fulfill their default electricity supply obligations  and fuel switching activities made possible by the multi fuel capabilities of some of conectiv energy s power plants

sales of ace generating facilities on september   ace completed the sale of its interest in the keystone and conemaugh generating facilities for million after giving effect to post closing adjustments 
on february   ace completed the sale of the bl england generating facility for a price of million 
no gain or loss was realized on these sales 
sale of interest in cogeneration joint venture during the first quarter of  conectiv energy recognized a million pre tax gain million after tax on the sale of its equity interest in a joint venture which owns a wood burning cogeneration facility 
proceeds from settlement of mirant bankruptcy claims in  pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generating assets to mirant 
in  mirant commenced a voluntary bankruptcy proceeding in which it sought to reject certain obligations that it had undertaken in connection with the asset sale 
as part of the asset sale  pepco entered into the tpas 
under a settlement to avoid the rejection by mirant of its obligations under the tpas in the bankruptcy proceeding  the terms of the tpas were modified to increase the purchase price of the energy and capacity supplied by mirant and pepco received the tpa claim 
in december  pepco sold the tpa claim  plus the right to receive accrued interest thereon  to an unaffiliated third party for million 
in addition  pepco received proceeds of 
million in settlement of an asbestos claim against the mirant bankruptcy estate 
after customer sharing  pepco recorded a pre tax gain of million from the settlement of these claims 
in connection with the asset sale  pepco and mirant also entered into a back to back arrangement  whereby mirant agreed to purchase from pepco the megawatts of electricity and capacity that pepco is obligated to purchase annually through from panda under the panda ppa at the purchase price pepco is obligated to pay to panda 
as part of the further settlement of pepco s claims against mirant arising from the mirant bankruptcy  pepco agreed not to contest the rejection by mirant of its obligations under the back to back arrangement in exchange for the payment by mirant of damages corresponding to the estimated amount by which the purchase price that pepco is obligated to pay panda for the energy and capacity exceeded the market price 
in  pepco received as damages million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of mirant common stock issued to it by mirant 
these funds are being accounted for as restricted cash based on management s intent to use such funds  and any interest earned thereon  for the sole purpose of paying for the future above market capacity and energy purchase costs under the panda ppa 
correspondingly  a regulatory liability has been established in the same amount to help offset the future above market capacity and energy purchase costs 
this restricted cash has been classified as a non current asset to be consistent with the classification of the non current regulatory liability  and any changes in the balance of this restricted cash  including interest on the invested funds  are being accounted for as operating cash flows 
as of december   the balance of the restricted cash account was million 
based on a reexamination of the costs of the panda ppa in light of current and projected wholesale market conditions conducted in the fourth quarter of  pepco determined that  principally due to increases in wholesale capacity prices  the present value above market cost of the panda ppa over the term of the agreement are expected to be significantly less than the current amount of the restricted cash account balance 
accordingly  on february   pepco filed applications with the dcpsc and the mpsc requesting orders directing pepco to maintain million in the restricted cash account and to use that cash  and any future earnings on the cash  for the sole purpose of paying the future above market cost of the panda ppa or  in the alternative  to fund a transfer or assignment of the remaining obligations under the panda ppa to a third party 
pepco also requested that the order provide that any cash remaining in the account at the conclusion of the panda ppa be refunded to customers and that any shortfall be recovered from customers 
pepco further proposed that the excess proceeds remaining from the settlement approximately million  representing the amount by which the regulatory liability of million at december  exceeded million be shared approximately equally with its customers in accordance with the procedures previously approved by each commission for the sharing of the proceeds received by pepco from the sale to mirant of its generating assets 
the regulatory liability of million at december  differs from the restricted cash amount of million on that date  in part  because the regulatory liability has been reduced for the portion of the december panda charges in excess of market that had not yet been paid from the restricted cash account 
the amount of the restricted cash balance that pepco is permitted to retain will be recorded as earnings upon approval of the sharing arrangement by the respective commissions 
at this time  pepco cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings 
in settlement of other damages claims against mirant  pepco in also received a settlement payment in the amount of million 
of this amount i million was recorded as a reduction in operating expenses  ii million was recorded as a reduction in a net pre petition receivable claim from mirant  iii million was recorded as a reduction in the capitalized costs of certain property  plant and equipment and iv 
million was recorded as a liability to reimburse a third party for certain legal costs associated with the settlement 
sale of buzzard point property in august  pepco sold for million excess non utility land located at buzzard point in the district of columbia 
the sale resulted in a pre tax gain of million which was recorded as a reduction of operating expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings 
financial investment liquidation in october  pci received million in cash and recorded an after tax gain of million related to the liquidation of a financial investment that was written off in capital requirements capital expenditures pepco holdings total capital expenditures for the year ended december  totaled million of which million related to pepco excluding million of reimbursements related to the settlement of the mirant bankruptcy claims  million related to dpl and million related to ace 
the remainder of million was primarily related to conectiv energy and pepco energy services 
the power delivery expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services  distribution reliability  and transmission

distribution  transmission and gas delivery the projected capital expenditures for distribution other than blueprint for the future  transmission other than mapp and gas delivery are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and reliability 
blueprint for the future during  pepco  dpl and ace each announced an initiative that it refers to as the blueprint for the future 
these initiatives combine traditional energy efficiency programs with new technologies and systems to help customers manage their energy use and reduce the total cost of energy 
the programs include demand side management efforts  such as rebates or other financial incentives for residential customers to replace inefficient appliances and for business customers to use more energy efficient equipment  such as improved lighting and hvac systems 
under the programs  customers also could receive credits on their bills for allowing the utility company to cycle  or intermittently turn off  their central air conditioning or heat pumps when wholesale electricity prices are high 
the programs contemplate that business customers would receive financial incentives for using energy efficient equipment  and would be rewarded for reducing use during periods of peak demand 
additionally  pepco and dpl intend to install smart meters for all customers in the district of columbia  maryland and delaware  providing the utilities with the ability to remotely read the meters and identify the location of a power outage 
pepco  dpl and ace have made filings with their respective regulatory commissions for approval of certain aspects of these programs 
the projected costs for phi s utility subsidiaries for the years through are included in the table above 
mapp project on october   phi received the approval of the pjm board of managers to build a new mile  kilovolt interstate transmission line as part of pjm s regional transmission expansion plan to address the reliability objectives of the pjm rto system 
the transmission line  which is referred to as the mapp project  will be located in northern virginia  maryland  the delmarva peninsula  and new jersey 
the preliminarily estimated cost of the mapp project is approximately billion 
construction is expected to occur in sections over a six year period with completion targeted by phi also plans to add significant kilovolt support lines in maryland and new jersey to connect with the new kilovolt line at an approximate cost of million 
pjm continues to evaluate the kilovolt support lines 
only the projected construction costs associated with the kilovolt transmission line for the years through are included in the table above 
delta project on december   conectiv energy announced a decision to construct a mw natural gas and oil fired combined cycle electricity generation plant to be located in peach bottom township  pennsylvania delta project 
the total construction expenditures for the delta project are expected to be million  with projected expenditures of million in  million in  million in  and million in  and are included in conectiv energy s projected capital expenditures shown in the table above 
the total expenditures include million in development costs and three combustion turbines currently held in inventory by conectiv energy 
the plant is expected to become operational by june cumberland project in  conectiv energy began construction of a new combustion turbine power plant in millville  new jersey 
the total construction expenditures for this project are expected to be million of which million was expended in  with projected expenditures of million in and million in these future expenditures are included in conectiv energy s projected capital expenditures shown in the table above 
compliance with delaware multipollutant regulations as required by the delaware multipollutant emissions regulations adopted by the delaware department of natural resources and environmental control  phi  in june  filed a compliance plan for controlling nitrogen oxide nox  sulfur dioxide so and mercury emissions from its edge moor power plant 
the plan includes installation of a sodium based sorbent injection system and a selective non catalytic reduction sncr system and carbon injection for edge moor units and  and use of an sncr system and lower sulfur oil at edge moor unit conectiv energy currently believes that with these modifications  it will be able to meet the requirements of the new regulations at an estimated capital cost of million 
the compliance plan filed by conectiv energy contemplates capital expenditures of million of capital in and million of capital in dividends pepco holdings annual dividend rate on its common stock is determined by the board of directors on a quarterly basis and takes into consideration  among other factors  current and possible future developments that may affect phi s income and cash flows 
in  phi s board of directors declared quarterly dividends of cents per share of common stock payable on march   june   september  and december  on january   the board of directors declared a dividend on common stock of cents per share payable march   to shareholders of record march  phi generates no operating income of its own 
accordingly  its ability to pay dividends to its shareholders depends on dividends received from its subsidiaries 
in addition to their future financial performance  the ability of phi s direct and indirect subsidiaries to pay dividends is subject to limits imposed by i state corporate and regulatory laws  which impose limitations on the funds that can be used to pay dividends and  in the case of regulatory laws  as applicable  may require the prior approval of the relevant utility regulatory commissions before dividends can be paid  ii the prior rights of holders of existing and future preferred stock  mortgage bonds and other long term debt issued by the subsidiaries  and any other restrictions imposed in connection with the incurrence of liabilities  and iii certain provisions of ace s certificate of incorporation which provides that  if any preferred stock is outstanding  no dividends may be paid on the ace common stock if  after payment  ace s common stock capital plus surplus would be less than the involuntary liquidation value of the outstanding preferred stock 
pepco and dpl have no shares of preferred stock outstanding 
currently  the restriction in the ace charter does not limit its ability to pay dividends 
pension funding pepco holdings has a noncontributory retirement plan the phi retirement plan that covers substantially all employees of pepco  dpl and ace and certain employees of other pepco holdings subsidiaries 
as of the valuation  the phi retirement plan satisfied the minimum funding requirements of the employment retirement income security act of erisa without requiring any additional funding 
phi s funding policy with regard to the phi retirement plan is to maintain a funding level in excess of of its accumulated benefit obligation abo 
in and  no contributions were made to the phi retirement plan 
in  the abo for the phi retirement plan decreased from  due to an increase in the discount rate used to value the abo obligation  which more than offset the accrual of an additional year of service for participants 
the phi retirement plan assets achieved returns in above the level assumed in the valuation 
as a result of the combination of these factors  no contribution was made to the phi retirement plan  because the funding level at year end was in excess of of the abo 
in  as a result of similar factors  phi made no contribution to the phi retirement plan 
assuming no changes to the current pension plan assumptions  phi projects no funding will be required under erisa in  however  phi may elect to make a discretionary tax deductible contribution  if required to maintain its assets in excess of abo for the phi retirement plan 
legislative changes  in the form of the pension protection act of  impact the funding requirements for pension plans beginning in the pension protection act alters the manner in which liabilities and asset values are determined for the purpose of calculating required pension contributions 
based on preliminary actuarial projections and assuming no changes to current pension plan assumptions  phi believes it is unlikely that there will be a required contribution in contractual obligations and commercial commitments summary information about pepco holdings consolidated contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   is as follows contractual maturity obligation a total less than year years years after years millions of dollars variable rate demand bonds commercial paper long term debt b long term project funding interest payments on debt capital leases liabilities and accrued interest related to effectively settled and uncertain tax positions operating leases non derivative fuel and purchase power contracts c total a estimates relating to the future funding of phi s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are not included in this table

third party guarantees  indemnifications and off balance sheet arrangements pepco holdings and certain of its subsidiaries have various financial and performance guarantees and indemnification obligations which are entered into in the normal course of business to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties as discussed below 
as of december   pepco holdings and its subsidiaries were parties to a variety of agreements pursuant to which they were guarantors for standby letters of credit  performance residual value  and other commitments and obligations 
these commitments and obligations  in millions of dollars  were as follows guarantor phi dpl ace other total energy marketing obligations of conectiv energy a energy procurement obligations of pepco energy services a guaranteed lease residual values b other c total a pepco holdings has contractual commitments ensuring the performance and related payments of conectiv energy and pepco energy services to counterparties under routine energy sales and procurement obligations  including retail customer load obligations of pepco energy services and requirements under bgs contracts entered into by conectiv energy with ace 
b subsidiaries of pepco holdings have guaranteed residual values in excess of fair value of certain equipment and fleet vehicles held through lease agreements 
as of december   obligations under the guarantees were approximately million 
assets leased under agreements subject to residual value guarantees are typically for periods ranging from years to years 
historically  payments under the guarantees have not been made by the guarantor as  under normal conditions  the contract runs to full term at which time the residual value is minimal 
as such  pepco holdings believes the likelihood of payment being required under the guarantee is remote 
c other guarantees consist of pepco holdings has guaranteed a subsidiary building lease of million 
pepco holdings does not expect to fund the full amount of the exposure under the guarantee 
pci has guaranteed facility rental obligations related to contracts entered into by starpower communications  llc  a joint venture in which pci prior to december had a interest 
as of december   the guarantees cover the remaining million in rental obligations 
pepco holdings and certain of its subsidiaries have entered into various indemnification agreements related to purchase and sale agreements and other types of contractual agreements with vendors and other third parties 
these indemnification agreements typically cover environmental  tax  litigation and other matters  as well as breaches of representations  warranties and covenants set forth in these agreements 
typically  claims may be made by third parties under these indemnification agreements over various periods of time depending on the nature of the claim 
the maximum potential exposure under these indemnification agreements can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount depending on the nature of the claim and the particular transaction 
the total maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnification agreements is not estimable due to several factors  including uncertainty as to whether or when claims may be made under these indemnities

contractual arrangements with credit rating triggers or margining rights under certain contractual arrangements entered into by phi s subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy business and other transactions  the subsidiary may be required to provide cash collateral or letters of credit as security for its contractual obligations if the credit ratings of the subsidiary are downgraded 
in the event of a downgrade  the amount required to be posted would depend on the amount of the underlying contractual obligation existing at the time of the downgrade 
based on contractual provisions in effect at december   phi estimates that if a one level downgrade in the credit rating of phi and each of its relevant subsidiaries were to occur  the additional aggregate cash collateral or letters of credit amount required would be million 
phi believes that it and its utility subsidiaries maintain adequate short term funding sources in the event the additional collateral or letters of credit are required 
see sources of capital short term funding sources 
many of the contractual arrangements entered into by phi s subsidiaries in connection with competitive energy and default electricity supply activities include margining rights pursuant to which the phi subsidiary or a counterparty may request collateral if the market value of the contractual obligations reaches levels in excess of the credit thresholds established in the applicable arrangements 
pursuant to these margining rights  the affected phi subsidiary may receive  or be required to post  collateral due to energy price movements 
as of december   pepco holdings subsidiaries engaged in competitive energy activities and default electricity supply activities provided net cash collateral in the amount of million in connection with these activities 
environmental remediation obligations phi s accrued liabilities as of december  include approximately million  of which million is expected to be incurred in  for potential environmental cleanup and other costs related to sites at which an operating subsidiary is a potentially responsible party prp  is alleged to be a third party contributor  or has made a decision to clean up contamination on its own property 
for information regarding projected expenditures for environmental control facilities  see item business environmental matters 
the most significant environmental remediation obligations as of december   were million  of which million is expected to be incurred in  payable by dpl in accordance with a consent agreement reached with the delaware department of natural resources and environmental control  for remediation  site restoration  natural resource damage compensatory projects and other costs associated with environmental contamination that resulted from an oil release at the indian river power plant  which was sold in june million in environmental remediation costs  of which million is expected to be incurred in  payable by conectiv energy associated with the deepwater generating facility

million  of which approximately  is expected to be incurred in  payable by dpl in connection with the wilmington coal gas south site located in wilmington  delaware  to remediate residual material from the historical operation of a manufactured gas plant 
 of which approximately  is expected to be incurred in  payable by pepco for long term monitoring associated with a pipeline oil release that occurred in sources of capital pepco holdings sources to meet its long term funding needs  such as capital expenditures  dividends  and new investments  and its short term funding needs  such as working capital and the temporary funding of long term funding needs  include internally generated funds  securities issuances and bank financing under new or existing facilities 
phi s ability to generate funds from its operations and to access capital and credit markets is subject to risks and uncertainties 
volatile and deteriorating financial market conditions  diminished liquidity and tightening credit may affect efficient access to certain of phi s potential funding sources 
see item a 
risk factors for additional discussion of important factors that may impact these sources of capital 
internally generated cash the primary source of pepco holdings internally generated funds is the cash flow generated by its regulated utility subsidiaries in the power delivery business 
additional sources of funds include cash flow generated from its non regulated subsidiaries and the sale of non core assets 
short term funding sources pepco holdings and its regulated utility subsidiaries have traditionally used a number of sources to fulfill short term funding needs  such as commercial paper  short term notes and bank lines of credit 
proceeds from short term borrowings are used primarily to meet working capital needs but may also be used to fund temporarily long term capital requirements 
pepco holdings maintains an ongoing commercial paper program of up to million 
pepco  dpl  and ace have ongoing commercial paper programs of up to million  up to million  and up to million  respectively 
the commercial paper can be issued with maturities of up to days 
phi  pepco  dpl and ace maintain a credit facility which supports the issuance of commercial paper and is available to provide for short term liquidity needs 
the aggregate borrowing limit under the facility is billion  all or any portion of which may be used to obtain loans or to issue letters of credit 
phi s credit limit under the facility is million 
the credit limit of each of pepco  dpl and ace is the lesser of million and the maximum amount of debt the company is permitted to have outstanding by its regulatory authorities  except that the aggregate amount of credit used by pepco  dpl and ace at any given time collectively may not exceed million 
the interest rate payable by each company on utilized funds is based on the prevailing prime rate or eurodollar rate  plus a margin that varies according to the credit rating of the borrower 
the facility also includes a swingline loan sub facility  pursuant to which each company may make same day borrowings in an aggregate amount not to exceed million 
any swingline loan must be repaid by the borrower within seven days of receipt thereof 
all indebtedness incurred under the facility is unsecured 
the facility commitment expiration date is may   with each company having the right to elect to have of the principal balance of the loans outstanding on the expiration date continued as non revolving term loans for a period of one year from such expiration date 
the facility is intended to serve primarily as a source of liquidity to support the commercial paper programs of the respective companies 
the companies also are permitted to use the facility to borrow funds for general corporate purposes and issue letters of credit 
in order for a borrower to use the facility  certain representations and warranties made by the borrower at the time the credit agreement was entered into also must be true at the time the facility is utilized  and the borrower must be in compliance with specified covenants  including the financial covenant described below 
however  a material adverse change in the borrower s business  property  and results of operations or financial condition subsequent to the entry into the credit agreement is not a condition to the availability of credit under the facility 
among the covenants to which each of the companies is subject are i the requirement that each borrowing company maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to total capitalization of or less  computed in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement  which calculation excludes certain trust preferred securities and deferrable interest subordinated debt from the definition of total indebtedness not to exceed of total capitalization  ii a restriction on sales or other dispositions of assets  other than sales and dispositions permitted by the credit agreement  and iii a restriction on the incurrence of liens on the assets of a borrower or any of its significant subsidiaries other than liens permitted by the credit agreement 
the credit agreement does not include any rating triggers 
long term funding sources the sources of long term funding for phi and its subsidiaries are the issuance of debt and equity securities and borrowing under long term credit agreements 
proceeds from long term financings are used primarily to fund long term capital requirements  such as capital expenditures and new investments  and to repay or refinance existing indebtedness 
regulatory restrictions on financing activities the issuance of both debt and equity securities by the principal subsidiaries of phi requires approval of either ferc or one or more state public utility commissions 
neither ferc approval nor state public utility commission approval is required as a condition to the issuance of securities by phi 
state financing authority pepco s long term financing activities including the issuance of securities and the incurrence of debt are subject to authorization by the district of columbia public service commission dcpsc and mpsc 
dpl s long term financing activities are subject to authorization by mpsc and the delaware public service commission dpsc 
ace s long term and short term consisting of debt instruments with a maturity of one year or less financing activities are subject to authorization by the new jersey board of public utilities njbpu 
each utility  through periodic filings with the state public service commission s having jurisdiction over its financing activities  typically maintains standing authority sufficient to cover its projected financing needs over a multi year period 
ferc financing authority under the federal power act fpa  ferc has jurisdiction over the issuance of long term and short term securities of public utilities  but only if the issuance is not regulated by the state public utility commission in which the public utility is organized and operating 
under these provisions  ferc has jurisdiction over the issuance of short term debt by pepco and dpl 
because conectiv energy and pepco energy services also qualify as public utilities under the fpa and are not regulated by a state utility commission  ferc approval would be required for the issuance of securities by those companies 
to the extent ferc approval is required for the issuance of securities by phi and its subsidiaries  the companies  in accordance with regulations adopted by ferc  are relying on authority granted in a financing order issued by the securities and exchange commission prior to the repeal of public utility holding company act the financing order  which extends through june  prior to june   phi s utility subsidiaries will file for new financing authority for the issuance of securities for which ferc approval is required 
money pool under the financing order  pepco holdings is authorized to operate a system money pool 
the money pool is a cash management mechanism used by pepco holdings to manage the short term investment and borrowing requirements of its subsidiaries that participate in the money pool 
pepco holdings may invest in but not borrow from the money pool 
eligible subsidiaries with surplus cash may deposit those funds in the money pool 
deposits in the money pool are guaranteed by pepco holdings 
eligible subsidiaries with cash requirements may borrow from the money pool 
borrowings from the money pool are unsecured 
depositors in the money pool receive  and borrowers from the money pool pay  an interest rate based primarily on pepco holdings short term borrowing rate 
pepco holdings deposits funds in the money pool to the extent that the pool has insufficient funds to meet the borrowing needs of its participants  which may require pepco holdings to borrow funds for deposit from external sources 
after expiration of the financing order  phi and its subsidiaries expect to engage in intra system cash management programs such as the money pool under a blanket authorization adopted by ferc 
regulatory and other matters proceeds from settlement of mirant bankruptcy claims in  pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generating assets to mirant 
in  mirant commenced a voluntary bankruptcy proceeding in which it sought to reject certain obligations that it had undertaken in connection with the asset sale 
as part of the asset sale  pepco entered into the tpas 
under a settlement to avoid the rejection by mirant of its obligations under the tpas in the bankruptcy proceeding  the terms of the tpas were modified to increase the purchase price of the energy and capacity supplied by mirant and pepco received the tpa claim 
in december  pepco sold the tpa claim  plus the right to receive accrued interest thereon  to an unaffiliated third party for million 
in addition  pepco received proceeds of 
million in settlement of an asbestos claim against the mirant bankruptcy estate 
after customer sharing  pepco recorded a pre tax gain of million from the settlement of these claims 
in connection with the asset sale  pepco and mirant also entered into a back to back arrangement  whereby mirant agreed to purchase from pepco the megawatts of electricity and capacity that pepco is obligated to purchase annually through from panda under the panda ppa at the purchase price pepco is obligated to pay to panda 
as part of the further settlement of pepco s claims against mirant arising from the mirant bankruptcy  pepco agreed not to contest the rejection by mirant of its obligations under the back to back arrangement in exchange for the payment by mirant of damages corresponding to the estimated amount by which the purchase price that pepco is obligated to pay panda for the energy and capacity exceeded the market price 
in  pepco received as damages million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of mirant common stock issued to it by mirant 
these funds are being accounted for as restricted cash based on management s intent to use such funds  and any interest earned thereon  for the sole purpose of paying for the future above market capacity and energy purchase costs under the panda ppa 
correspondingly  a regulatory liability has been established in the same amount to help offset the future above market capacity and energy purchase costs 
this restricted cash has been classified as a non current asset to be consistent with the classification of the non current regulatory liability  and any changes in the balance of this restricted cash  including interest on the invested funds  are being accounted for as operating cash flows 
as of december   the balance of the restricted cash account was million 
based on a reexamination of the costs of the panda ppa in light of current and projected wholesale market conditions conducted in the fourth quarter of  pepco determined that  principally due to increases in wholesale capacity prices  the present value above market cost of the panda ppa over the term of the agreement is expected to be significantly less than the current amount of the restricted cash account balance 
accordingly  on february   pepco filed applications with the dcpsc and the mpsc requesting orders directing pepco to maintain million in the restricted cash account and to use that cash  and any future earnings on the cash  for the sole purpose of paying the future above market cost of the panda ppa or  in the alternative  to fund a transfer or assignment of the remaining obligations under the panda ppa to a third party 
pepco also requested that the order provide that any cash remaining in the account at the conclusion of the panda ppa be refunded to customers and that any shortfall be recovered from customers 
pepco further proposed that the excess proceeds remaining from the settlement approximately million  representing the amount by which the regulatory liability of million at december  exceeded million be shared approximately equally with its customers in accordance with the procedures previously approved by each commission for the sharing of the proceeds received by pepco from the sale to mirant of its generating assets 
the regulatory liability of million at december  differs from the restricted cash amount of million on that date  in part  because the regulatory liability has been reduced for the portion of the december panda charges in excess of market that had not yet been paid from the restricted cash account 
the amount of the restricted cash balance that pepco is permitted to retain will be recorded as earnings upon approval of the sharing arrangement by the respective commissions 
at this time  pepco cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings 
in settlement of other damages claims against mirant  pepco in also received a settlement payment in the amount of million 
of this amount i million was recorded as a reduction in operating expenses  ii million was recorded as a reduction in a net pre petition receivable claim from mirant  iii million was recorded as a reduction in the capitalized costs of certain property  plant and equipment and iv 
million was recorded as a liability to reimburse a third party for certain legal costs associated with the settlement 
rate proceedings in electric service distribution base rate cases filed by pepco in the district of columbia and maryland  and by dpl in maryland  and pending in  pepco and dpl proposed the adoption of a bsa for retail customers 
under the bsa  customer delivery rates are subject to adjustment through a surcharge or credit mechanism  depending on whether actual distribution revenue per customer exceeds or falls short of the approved revenue per customer amount 
the bsa will increase rates if actual distribution revenues fall below the level approved by the applicable commission and will decrease rates if actual distribution revenues are above the approved level 
the result will be that  over time  the utility would collect its authorized revenues for distribution deliveries 
as a consequence  a bsa decouples revenue from unit sales consumption and ties the growth in revenues to the growth in the number of customers 
some advantages of the bsa are that it i eliminates revenue fluctuations due to weather and changes in customer usage patterns and  therefore  provides for more predictable utility distribution revenues that are better aligned with costs  ii provides for more reliable fixed cost recovery  iii tends to stabilize customers delivery bills  and iv removes any disincentives for the regulated utilities to promote energy efficiency programs for their customers  because it breaks the link between overall sales volumes and delivery revenues 
the status of the bsa proposals in each of the jurisdictions is described below in discussion of the respective base rate proceedings

district of columbia in december  pepco submitted an application to the dcpsc to increase electric distribution base rates  including a proposed bsa 
the application to the dcpsc requested an annual increase of approximately million or an overall increase of  reflecting a proposed return on equity roe of 
in the alternative  the application requested an annual increase of million or an overall increase of  reflecting an roe of  if the bsa were not approved 
subsequently  pepco reduced its annual revenue increase request to million including a proposed bsa and million if the bsa were not approved 
on january   the dcpsc approved a revenue requirement increase of approximately million  based on an authorized return on rate base of  including a roe 
the rate increase is effective february  the dcpsc  while finding the bsa to be an appropriate ratemaking concept  cited potential statutory problems in the dcpsc s ability to implement the bsa 
the dcpsc stated that it intends to issue an order to establish a phase ii proceeding to consider these implementation issues 
maryland on july   the mpsc issued orders in the electric service distribution rate cases filed by dpl and pepco  each of which included approval of a bsa 
the dpl order approved an annual increase in distribution rates of approximately million including a decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately 
million 
the pepco order approved an annual increase in distribution rates of approximately million including a decrease in annual depreciation expense of approximately million 
in each case  the approved distribution rate reflects an roe of 
the orders each provided that the rate increases are effective as of june   and will remain in effect for an initial period of nine months from the date of the order or until april  
these rates are subject to a phase ii proceeding in which the mpsc will consider the results of audits of each company s cost allocation manual  as filed with the mpsc  to determine whether a further adjustment to the rates is required 
hearings for the phase ii proceeding are scheduled for mid march new jersey on june   ace filed with the njbpu an application for permission to decrease the non utility generation charge ngc and increase components of its societal benefits charge sbc to be collected from customers for the period october  through september  the proposed changes are designed to effect a true up of the actual and estimated costs and revenues collected through the current ngc and sbc rates through september  and  in the case of the sbc  forecasted costs and revenues for the period october  through september  as of december   the ngc  which is intended primarily to recover the above market component of payments made by ace under non utility generation contracts and stranded costs associated with those commitments  had an over recovery balance of million 
the filing proposed that the estimated ngc balance as of september  in the amount of million  including interest  be amortized and returned to ace customers over a four year period  beginning october  as of december   the sbc  which is intended to allow ace to recover certain costs involved with various njbpu mandated social programs  had an under recovery of approximately million  primarily due to increased costs associated with funding the new jersey clean energy program 
in addition  ace has requested an increase to the sbc to reflect the funding levels approved by the njbpu of million for the period october  through september   bringing to million the total recovery requested for the period october  to september  based upon actual data through august 
the net impact of the proposed adjustments to the ngc and the sbc  including associated changes in sales and use tax  is an overall rate decrease of approximately million for the period october  through september  based upon actual data through august 
the proposed adjustments and the corresponding changes in customer rates are subject to the approval of the njbpu 
if approved and implemented  ace anticipates that the revised rates will remain in effect until september   subject to an annual true up and change each year thereafter 
the proposed adjustments and the corresponding changes in customer rates remain under review by the njbpu and have not yet been implemented 
ace restructuring deferral proceeding pursuant to orders issued by the njbpu under the new jersey electric discount and energy competition act edeca  beginning august   ace was obligated to provide bgs to retail electricity customers in its service territory who did not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier 
for the period august  through july   ace s aggregate costs that it was allowed to recover from customers exceeded its aggregate revenues from supplying bgs 
these under recovered costs were partially offset by a million deferred energy cost liability existing as of july  leac liability related to ace s levelized energy adjustment clause and ace s demand side management programs 
ace established a regulatory asset in an amount equal to the balance of under recovered costs 
in august  ace filed a petition with the njbpu for the recovery of approximately million in actual and projected deferred costs relating to the provision of bgs and other restructuring related costs incurred by ace over the four year period august  through july   net of the million offset for the leac liability 
the petition also requested that ace s rates be reset as of august  so that there would be no under recovery of costs embedded in the rates on or after that date 
the increase sought represented an overall annual increase in electric rates 
in july  the njbpu issued a final order in the restructuring deferral proceeding confirming a july summary order  which i permitted ace to begin collecting a portion of the deferred costs and reset rates to recover on going costs incurred as a result of edeca  ii approved the recovery of million of the deferred balance over a ten year amortization period beginning august   iii transferred to ace s then pending base rate case for further consideration approximately million of the deferred balance the base rate case ended in a settlement approved by the njbpu in may  the result of which is that any net rate impact from the deferral account recoveries and credits in future years will depend in part on whether rates associated with other deferred accounts considered in the case continue to generate over collections relative to costs  and iv estimated the overall deferral balance as of july  at million  of which million was disallowed recovery by ace 
although ace believes the record does not justify the level of disallowance imposed by the njbpu in the final order  the million of disallowed incurred costs were reserved during the years through primarily through charges to earnings  primarily in the operating expense line item deferred electric service costs  with a corresponding reduction in the regulatory asset balance sheet account 
in  an additional million in interest on the disallowed amount was identified and reserved by ace 
in august  ace filed a notice of appeal with respect to the july final order with the appellate division of the superior court of new jersey the appellate division  which hears appeals of the decisions of new jersey administrative agencies  including the njbpu 
on august   the appellate division  citing deference to the factual and policy findings of the njbpu  affirmed the njbpu s decision in its entirety  rejecting challenges from ace and the division of rate counsel 
on september   ace filed an application for certification to the new jersey supreme court 
on january   the new jersey supreme court denied ace s application for certification 
because the full amount at issue in this proceeding was previously reserved by ace  there will be no further financial statement impact to ace 
divestiture cases district of columbia final briefs on pepco s district of columbia divestiture proceeds sharing application were filed with the dcpsc in july following an evidentiary hearing in june that application was filed to implement a provision of pepco s dcpsc approved divestiture settlement that provided for a sharing of any net proceeds from the sale of pepco s generation related assets 
one of the principal issues in the case is whether pepco should be required to share with customers the excess deferred income taxes edit and accumulated deferred investment tax credits aditc associated with the sold assets and  if so  whether such sharing would violate the normalization provisions of the internal revenue code irc and its implementing regulations 
as of december   the district of columbia allocated portions of edit and aditc associated with the divested generating assets were approximately million and million  respectively 
pepco believes that a sharing of edit and aditc would violate the internal revenue service irs normalization rules 
under these rules  pepco could not transfer the edit and the aditc benefit to customers more quickly than on a straight line basis over the book life of the related assets 
since the assets are no longer owned by pepco  there is no book life over which the edit and aditc can be returned 
if pepco were required to share edit and aditc and  as a result  the normalization rules were violated  pepco would be unable to use accelerated depreciation on district of columbia allocated or assigned property 
in addition to sharing with customers the generation related edit and aditc balances  pepco would have to pay to the irs an amount equal to pepco s district of columbia jurisdictional generation related aditc balance million as of december   as well as its district of columbia jurisdictional transmission and distribution related aditc balance million as of december  in each case as those balances exist as of the later of the date a dcpsc order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed  or the date the dcpsc order becomes operative 
in march  the irs issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr  which would allow for the sharing of edit and aditc related to divested assets with utility customers on a prospective basis and at the election of the taxpayer on a retroactive basis 
in december a revised nopr was issued which  among other things  withdrew the march nopr and eliminated the taxpayer s ability to elect to apply the regulation retroactively 
comments on the revised nopr were filed in march  and a public hearing was held in april pepco filed a letter with the dcpsc in january  in which it has reiterated that the dcpsc should continue to defer any decision on the aditc and edit issues until the irs issues final regulations or states that its regulations project related to this issue will be terminated without the issuance of any regulations 
other issues in the divestiture proceeding deal with the treatment of internal costs and cost allocations as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture 
pepco believes that its calculation of the district of columbia customers share of divestiture proceeds is correct 
however  depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding  pepco could be required to make additional gain sharing payments to district of columbia customers  including the payments described above related to edit and aditc 
such additional payments which  other than the edit and aditc related payments  cannot be estimated would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on pepco s and phi s results of operations for those periods 
however  neither phi nor pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments  if any  or the aditc related payments to the irs  if required  would have a material adverse impact on its financial position or cash flows 
maryland pepco filed its divestiture proceeds plan application with the mpsc in april the principal issue in the maryland case is the same edit and aditc sharing issue that has been raised in the district of columbia case 
see the discussion above under divestiture cases district of columbia 
as of december   the maryland allocated portions of edit and aditc associated with the divested generating assets were approximately million and million  respectively 
other issues deal with the treatment of certain costs as deductions from the gross proceeds of the divestiture 
in november  the hearing examiner in the maryland proceeding issued a proposed order with respect to the application that concluded that pepco s maryland divestiture settlement agreement provided for a sharing between pepco and customers of the edit and aditc associated with the sold assets 
pepco believes that such a sharing would violate the normalization rules discussed above and would result in pepco s inability to use accelerated depreciation on maryland allocated or assigned property 
if the proposed order is affirmed  pepco would have to share with its maryland customers  on an approximately basis  the maryland allocated portion of the generation related edit million as of december   and the maryland allocated portion of generation related aditc 
furthermore  pepco would have to pay to the irs an amount equal to pepco s maryland jurisdictional generation related aditc balance million as of december   as well as its maryland retail jurisdictional aditc transmission and distribution related balance million as of december   in each case as those balances exist as of the later of the date a mpsc order is issued and all rights to appeal have been exhausted or lapsed  or the date the mpsc order becomes operative 
the hearing examiner decided all other issues in favor of pepco  except for the determination that only one half of the severance payments that pepco included in its calculation of corporate reorganization costs should be deducted from the sales proceeds before sharing of the net gain between pepco and customers 
pepco filed a letter with the mpsc in january  in which it has reiterated that the mpsc should continue to defer any decision on the aditc and edit issues until the irs issues final regulations or states that its regulations project related to this issue will be terminated without the issuance of any regulations 
in december  pepco appealed the hearing examiner s decision to the mpsc as it relates to the treatment of edit and aditc and corporate reorganization costs 
the mpsc has not issued any ruling on the appeal and pepco does not believe that it will do so until action is taken by the irs as described above 
however  depending on the ultimate outcome of this proceeding  pepco could be required to share with its customers approximately percent of the edit and aditc balances described above in addition to the additional gain sharing payments relating to the disallowed severance payments 
such additional payments would be charged to expense in the quarter and year in which a final decision is rendered and could have a material adverse effect on results of operations for those periods 
however  neither phi nor pepco believes that additional gain sharing payments  if any  or the aditc related payments to the irs  if required  would have a material adverse impact on its financial position or cash flows 
new jersey in connection with the divestiture by ace of its nuclear generating assets  the njbpu in july preliminarily determined that the amount of stranded costs associated with the divested assets that ace could recover from ratepayers should be reduced by approximately million  consisting of million of accumulated deferred federal income taxes adfit associated with accelerated depreciation on the divested nuclear assets  and million of current tax loss from selling the assets at a price below the tax basis 
the million in deferred taxes associated with the divested assets accelerated depreciation  however  is subject to the normalization rules 
due to uncertainty under federal tax law regarding whether the sharing of federal income tax benefits associated with the divested assets  including adfit related to accelerated depreciation  with ace s customers would violate the normalization rules  ace submitted a request to the irs for a private letter ruling plr to clarify the applicable law 
the njbpu delayed its final determination of the amount of recoverable stranded costs until after the receipt of the plr 
on may   the irs issued the plr in which it stated that returning to ratepayers any of the unamortized adfit attributable to accelerated depreciation on the divested assets after the sale of the assets by means of a reduction of the amount of recoverable stranded costs would violate the normalization rules 
on june   ace submitted a letter to the njbpu  requesting that the njbpu conduct proceedings to finalize the determination of the stranded costs associated with the sale of ace s nuclear assets in accordance with the plr 
in the absence of an njbpu action regarding ace s request  on june   ace filed a motion requesting that the njbpu issue an order finalizing the determination of such stranded costs in accordance with the plr 
on october   the njbpu approved a stipulation resolving the adfit issue and issued a clarifying order  which concludes that the million in stranded cost reduction  including the million in adfit  does not violate the irs normalization rules 
in explaining this result  the njbpu stated that i its earlier orders determining ace s recoverable stranded costs net of tax did not cause adfit associated with certain divested nuclear assets to reduce stranded costs otherwise recoverable from ace s ratepayers  and ii because the market transition charge tax component of the stranded cost recovery was intended by the njbpu to gross up net of tax stranded costs  thereby ensuring and establishing that the adfit balance was not flowed through to ratepayers  the normalization rules were not violated 
default electricity supply proceedings virginia in june  the virginia state corporation commission vscc denied dpl s request for an increase in its rates for default service for the period july  to may  dpl appealed in both state and federal courts 
those appeals have been dismissed in light of the closing of the sale of dpl s virginia electric operations as described below under the heading dpl sale of virginia operations 
ace sale of bl england generating facility on february   ace completed the sale of the bl england generating facility to rc cape may holdings  llc rc cape may  an affiliate of rockland capital energy investments  llc  for which it received proceeds of approximately million 
at the time of the sale  rc cape may and ace agreed to submit to arbitration the issue of whether rc cape may  under the terms of the purchase agreement  must pay to ace an additional million as part of the purchase price 
on february   the arbitrators issued a decision awarding million to ace  plus interest  attorneys fees and costs  for a total award of approximately million 
on july   ace received a claim for indemnification from rc cape may under the purchase agreement 
rc cape may contends that one of the assets it purchased  a contract for terminal services tsa between ace and citgo asphalt refining co 
citgo  has been declared by citgo to have been terminated due to a failure by ace to renew the contract in a timely manner 
rc cape may has commenced an arbitration proceeding against citgo seeking a determination that the tsa remains in effect and has notified ace of the proceeding 
in addition  rc cape may has asserted a claim for indemnification from ace in the amount of million if the tsa is held not to be enforceable against citgo 
while ace believes that it has defenses to the indemnification under the terms of the purchase agreement  should the arbitrator rule that the tsa has terminated  the outcome of this matter is uncertain 
ace notified rc cape may of its intent to participate in the pending arbitration 
the sale of bl england will not affect the stranded costs associated with the plant that already have been securitized 
ace anticipates that approximately million to million of additional regulatory assets related to bl england may  subject to njbpu approval  be eligible for recovery as stranded costs 
approximately million in emission allowance credits associated with b 
l 
england were monetized for the benefit of ace s ratepayers pursuant to the njbpu order approving the sale 
net proceeds from the sale of the plant and monetization of the emission allowance credits  estimated to be million as of december   will be credited to ace s ratepayers in accordance with the requirements of edeca and njbpu orders 
the appropriate mechanism for crediting the net proceeds from the sale of the plant and the monetized emission allowance credits to ratepayers is being determined in a proceeding that is currently pending before the njbpu 
dpl sale of virginia operations on january   dpl completed i the sale of its retail electric distribution business on the eastern shore of virginia to a n electric cooperative a n for a purchase price of approximately million  after closing adjustments  and ii the sale of its wholesale electric transmission business located on the eastern shore of virginia to old dominion electric cooperative odec for a purchase price of approximately million  after closing adjustments 
each of a n and odec assumed certain post closing liabilities and unknown pre closing liabilities related to the respective assets they are purchasing including  in the a n transaction  most environmental liabilities  except that dpl remained liable for unknown pre closing liabilities if they become known within six months after the january  closing date 
these sales are expected to result in an immaterial financial gain to dpl that will be recorded in the first quarter of pepco energy services deactivation of power plants pepco energy services owns and operates two oil fired power plants 
the power plants are located in washington  dc and have a generating capacity rating of approximately mw 
pepco energy services sells the output of these plants into the wholesale market administered by pjm 
in february  pepco energy services provided notice to pjm of its intention to deactivate these plants 
in may  pepco energy services deactivated one combustion turbine at its buzzard point facility with a generating capacity of approximately mw 
pepco energy services currently plans to deactivate the balance of both plants by may pjm has informed pepco energy services that these facilities are not expected to be needed for reliability after that time  but that its evaluation is dependent on the completion of transmission upgrades 
pepco energy services timing for deactivation of these units  in whole or in part  may be accelerated or delayed based on the operating condition of the units  economic conditions  and reliability considerations 
prior to deactivation of the plants  pepco energy services may incur deficiency charges imposed by pjm at a rate up to two times the capacity payment price that the plants receive 
deactivation is not expected to have a material impact on phi s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
general litigation during  pepco was served with amended complaints filed in the state circuit courts of prince george s county  baltimore city and baltimore county  maryland in separate ongoing  consolidated proceedings known as in re personal injury asbestos case 
pepco and other corporate entities were brought into these cases on a theory of premises liability 
under this theory  the plaintiffs argued that pepco was negligent in not providing a safe work environment for employees or its contractors  who allegedly were exposed to asbestos while working on pepco s property 
initially  a total of approximately individual plaintiffs added pepco to their complaints 
while the pleadings are not entirely clear  it appears that each plaintiff sought million in compensatory damages and million in punitive damages from each defendant 
since the initial filings in  additional individual suits have been filed against pepco  and significant numbers of cases have been dismissed 
as a result of two motions to dismiss  numerous hearings and meetings and one motion for summary judgment  pepco has had approximately of these cases successfully dismissed with prejudice  either voluntarily by the plaintiff or by the court 
as of december   there are approximately cases still pending against pepco in the state courts of maryland  of which approximately cases were filed after december   and were tendered to mirant for defense and indemnification pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase and sale agreement between pepco and mirant under which pepco sold its generation assets to mirant in while the aggregate amount of monetary damages sought in the remaining suits excluding those tendered to mirant is approximately million  phi and pepco believe the amounts claimed by current plaintiffs are greatly exaggerated 
the amount of total liability  if any  and any related insurance recovery cannot be determined at this time  however  based on information and relevant circumstances known at this time  neither phi nor pepco believes these suits will have a material adverse effect on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  if an unfavorable decision were rendered against pepco  it could have a material adverse effect on pepco s and phi s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
cash balance plan litigation in  conectiv established a cash balance retirement plan to replace defined benefit retirement plans then maintained by ace and dpl 
following the acquisition by pepco of conectiv  this plan became the conectiv cash balance sub plan within the phi retirement plan 
in september  three management employees of phi service company filed suit in the us district court for the district of delaware the delaware district court against the phi retirement plan  phi and conectiv the phi parties  alleging violations of erisa  on behalf of a class of management employees who did not have enough age and service when the cash balance sub plan was implemented in to assure that their accrued benefits would be calculated pursuant to the terms of the predecessor plans sponsored by ace and dpl 
a fourth plaintiff was added to the case to represent dpl legacy employees who were not eligible for grandfathered benefits 
the plaintiffs challenged the design of the cash balance sub plan and sought a declaratory judgment that the cash balance sub plan was invalid and that the accrued benefits of each member of the class should be calculated pursuant to the terms of the predecessor plans 
specifically  the complaint alleged that the use of a variable rate to compute the plaintiffs accrued benefit under the cash balance sub plan resulted in reductions in the accrued benefits that violated erisa 
the complaint also alleged that the benefit accrual rates and the minimal accrual requirements of the cash balance sub plan violated erisa as did the notice that was given to plan participants upon implementation of the cash balance sub plan 
on september   the delaware district court issued an order granting summary judgment in favor of the phi parties 
on october   the plaintiffs filed an appeal of the decision to the us court of appeals for the third circuit 
if the plaintiffs were to prevail in this litigation  the abo and projected benefit obligation pbo calculated in accordance with sfas no 
each would increase by approximately million  assuming no change in benefits for persons who have already retired or whose employment has been terminated and using actuarial valuation data as of the time the suit was filed 
the abo represents the present value that participants have earned as of the date of calculation 
this means that only service already worked and compensation already earned and paid is considered 
the pbo is similar to the abo  except that the pbo includes recognition of the effect that estimated future pay increases would have on the pension plan obligation 
environmental litigation phi  through its subsidiaries  is subject to regulation by various federal  regional  state  and local authorities with respect to the environmental effects of its operations  including air and water quality control  solid and hazardous waste disposal  and limitations on land use 
in addition  federal and state statutes authorize governmental agencies to compel responsible parties to clean up certain abandoned or unremediated hazardous waste sites 
phi s subsidiaries may incur costs to clean up currently or formerly owned facilities or sites found to be contaminated  as well as other facilities or sites that may have been contaminated due to past disposal practices 
although penalties assessed for violations of environmental laws and regulations are not recoverable from customers of the operating utilities  environmental clean up costs incurred by pepco  dpl and ace would be included by each company in its respective cost of service for ratemaking purposes

the consent decree is expected to be filed with the us district court in north carolina in the second quarter of deepwater generating station 
on december   njdep issued a title v operating permit for conectiv energy s deepwater generating station 
the permit includes new limits on unit heat input 
in order to comply with these new operational limits  conectiv energy restricted the output of the deepwater generating station s unit and unit in and the first half of  these restrictions resulted in operating losses of approximately  per operating day on unit  primarily because of lost revenues due to reduced output  and to a lesser degree because of lost revenues related to capacity requirements of pjm 
since june   deepwater unit can operate within the heat input limits set forth in the title v operating permit without restricting output  because of technical improvements that partially corrected the inherent bias in the continuous emissions monitoring system that had caused recorded heat input to be higher than actual heat input 
in order to comply with the heat input limit at deepwater unit  conectiv energy continues to restrict unit output  resulting in operating losses of approximately  in the second half of and projected operating losses in of approximately  due to penalties and lost revenues related to pjm capacity requirements 
beyond  while penalties due to pjm capacity requirements are not expected  further operating losses due to lost revenues related to pjm capacity requirements may continue to be incurred 
the operating losses due to reduced output on unit have been  and are expected to continue to be  insignificant 
conectiv energy is challenging these heat input restrictions and other provisions of the title v operating permit for deepwater generating station in the new jersey office of administrative law oal 
on october   the oal issued a decision granting summary decision in favor of conectiv energy  finding that hourly heat input shall not be used as a condition or limit for conectiv energy s electric generating operations 
on october   the njdep commissioner denied njdep s request for interlocutory review of the oal order and determined that the commissioner would review the october  order upon completion of the proceeding on conectiv energy s other challenges to the deepwater title v permit 
a hearing on the remaining challenged title v permit provisions is scheduled for mid april on april   njdep issued an administrative order and notice of civil administrative penalty assessment the first order alleging that at conectiv energy s deepwater generating station  the maximum gross heat input to unit exceeded the maximum allowable heat input in calendar year and the maximum gross heat input to unit exceeded the maximum allowable heat input in calendar years and the order required the cessation of operation of units and above the alleged permitted heat input levels  assessed a penalty of approximately million and requested that conectiv energy provide additional information about heat input to units and conectiv energy provided njdep units and calendar year heat input data on may   and calendar years to heat input data on july  on may   njdep issued a second administrative order and notice of civil administrative penalty assessment the second order alleging that the maximum gross heat input to units and exceeded the maximum allowable heat input in calendar year the second order required the cessation of operation of units and above the alleged permitted heat input levels and assessed a penalty of  conectiv energy has requested a contested case hearing challenging the issuance of the first order and the second order and moved for a stay of the orders pending resolution of the title v operating permit contested case described above 
on november   the oal issued orders placing the first order and the second order on the inactive list for six months 
until the oal decision discussed above is final  it will not have an impact on these currently inactive enforcement cases 
irs examination of like kind exchange transaction in  conectiv and certain of its subsidiaries the conectiv group were engaged in the implementation of a strategy to divest non strategic electric generating facilities and replace these facilities with mid merit electric generating capacity 
as part of this strategy  the conectiv group exchanged its interests in two older coal fired plants for the more efficient gas fired hay road ii generating facility  which was owned by an unaffiliated third party 
for tax purposes  conectiv treated the transaction as a like kind exchange under irc section as a result  approximately million of taxable gain was deferred for federal income tax purposes 
the transaction was examined by the irs as part of the normal conectiv tax audit 
in may  the irs issued a revenue agent s report rar for the audit of conectiv s  and income tax returns  in which the irs disallowed the qualification of the exchange under irc section in july  conectiv filed a protest of this disallowance to the irs office of appeals 
phi believes that its tax position related to this transaction is proper based on applicable statutes  regulations and case law and is contesting the disallowance 
however  there is no absolute assurance that conectiv s position will prevail 
if the irs prevails  conectiv would be subject to additional income taxes  interest and possible penalties 
however  a portion of the denied benefit would be offset by additional tax depreciation 
phi has accrued approximately million related to this matter 
as of december   if the irs were to fully prevail  the potential cash impact on phi would be current income tax and interest payments of approximately million and the earnings impact would be approximately million in after tax interest 
federal tax treatment of cross border leases pci maintains a portfolio of cross border energy sale leaseback transactions  which  as of december   had a book value of approximately billion  and from which phi currently derives approximately million per year in tax benefits in the form of interest and depreciation deductions 
in  the treasury department and irs issued notice informing taxpayers that the irs intends to challenge on various grounds the purported tax benefits claimed by taxpayers entering into certain sale leaseback transactions with tax indifferent parties ie  municipalities  tax exempt and governmental entities  including those entered into on or prior to march  the notice 
all of pci s cross border energy leases are with tax indifferent parties and were entered into prior to also in  the irs published a coordinated issue paper concerning the resolution of audit issues related to such transactions 
pci s cross border energy leases are similar to those sale leaseback transactions described in the notice and the coordinated issue paper 
pci s leases have been under examination by the irs as part of the normal phi tax audit 
in  the irs issued its final rar for its audit of phi s and income tax returns 
in the rar  the irs disallowed the tax benefits claimed by phi with respect to these leases for those years 
the tax benefits claimed by phi with respect to these leases from through december  were approximately million 
phi has filed a protest against the irs adjustments and the unresolved audit has been forwarded to the us office of appeals 
the ultimate outcome of this issue is uncertain  however  if the irs prevails  phi would be subject to additional taxes  along with interest and possibly penalties on the additional taxes  which could have a material adverse effect on phi s financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
phi believes that its tax position related to these transactions was appropriate based on applicable statutes  regulations and case law  and intends to contest the adjustments proposed by the irs  however  there is no assurance that phi s position will prevail 
in  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp on financial accounting standards fas  which amends sfas no 
effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this amendment requires a lease to be repriced and the book value adjusted when there is a change or probable change in the timing of tax benefits of the lease  regardless of whether the change results in a deferral or permanent loss of tax benefits 
accordingly  a material change in the timing of cash flows under phi s cross border leases as the result of a settlement with the irs would require an adjustment to the book value of the leases and a charge to earnings equal to the repricing impact of the disallowed deductions which could result in a material adverse effect on phi s financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
phi believes its tax position was appropriate and at this time does not believe there is a probable change in the timing of its tax benefits that would require repricing the leases and a charge to earnings 
on december  the us senate passed its version of the farm  nutrition  and bioenergy act of hr  which contains a provision that would apply passive loss limitation rules to leases with foreign tax indifferent parties effective for taxable years beginning after december   even if the leases were entered into on or prior to march  the us house of representatives version of this proposed legislation which it passed on july  does not contain any provision that would modify the current treatment of leases with tax indifferent parties 
enactment into law of a bill that is similar to that passed by the us senate in its current form could result in a material delay of the income tax benefits that phi would receive in connection with its cross border energy leases 
furthermore  if legislation of this type were to be enacted  under fsp fas  phi would be required to adjust the book value of the leases and record a charge to earnings equal to the repricing impact of the deferred deductions which could result in a material adverse effect on phi s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the us house of representatives and the us senate are expected to hold a conference in the near future to reconcile the differences in the two bills to determine the final legislation 
irs mixed service cost issue during  pepco  dpl  and ace changed their methods of accounting with respect to capitalizable construction costs for income tax purposes 
the change allowed the companies to accelerate the deduction of certain expenses that were previously capitalized and depreciated 
through december   these accelerated deductions generated incremental tax cash flow benefits of approximately million consisting of million for pepco  million for dpl  and million for ace for the companies  primarily attributable to their tax returns 
in  the treasury department released proposed regulations that  if adopted in their current form  would require pepco  dpl  and ace to change their method of accounting with respect to capitalizable construction costs for income tax purposes for tax periods beginning in based on those proposed regulations  phi in its federal tax return adopted an alternative method of accounting for capitalizable construction costs that management believes will be acceptable to the irs 
at the same time as the new proposed regulations were released  the irs issued revenue ruling  which is intended to limit the ability of certain taxpayers to utilize the method of accounting for income tax purposes for and prior years with respect to capitalizable construction costs 
in line with this revenue ruling  the irs rar for the and tax returns disallowed substantially all of the incremental tax benefits that pepco  dpl and ace had claimed on those returns by requiring the companies to capitalize and depreciate certain expenses rather than treat such expenses as current deductions 
phi s protest of the irs adjustments is among the unresolved audit matters relating to the and audits pending before the appeals office 
in february  phi paid approximately million of taxes to cover the amount of additional taxes that management estimated to be payable for the years through based on the method of tax accounting that phi  pursuant to the proposed regulations  has adopted on its tax return 
however  if the irs is successful in requiring pepco  dpl and ace to capitalize and depreciate construction costs that result in a tax and interest assessment greater than management s estimate of million  phi will be required to pay additional taxes and interest only to the extent these adjustments exceed the million payment made in february it is reasonably possible that phi s unrecognized tax benefits related to this issue will significantly decrease in the next months as a result of a settlement with the irs 
critical accounting policies general pepco holdings has identified the following accounting policies  including certain estimates  that as a result of the judgments  uncertainties  uniqueness and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved  could result in material changes to its financial condition or results of operations under different conditions or using different assumptions 
pepco holdings has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
goodwill impairment evaluation pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in its goodwill impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because i they may be susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about the discounting of future cash flows  which are inherently uncertain  ii actual results could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on pepco holdings assets and the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material 
pepco holdings tests its goodwill for impairment annually as of july  and whenever an event occurs or circumstances change in the interim that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
substantially all of pepco holdings goodwill was generated by pepco s acquisition of conectiv in and was allocated to pepco holdings power delivery segment 
in order to estimate the fair value of its power delivery segment  pepco holdings discounts the estimated future cash flows associated with the segment using a discounted cash flow model with a single interest rate that is commensurate with the risk involved with such an investment 
the estimation of fair value is dependent on a number of factors  including but not limited to interest rates  future growth assumptions  operating and capital expenditure requirements and other factors  changes in which could materially impact the results of impairment testing 
pepco holdings july  goodwill impairment testing indicated that its goodwill balance was not impaired 
a hypothetical decrease in the power delivery segment s forecasted cash flows of percent would not have resulted in an impairment charge 
long lived assets impairment evaluation pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in its long lived asset impairment evaluation process represent critical accounting estimates because i they are highly susceptible to change from period to period because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about undiscounted and discounted future cash flows and fair values  which are inherently uncertain  ii actual results could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii the impact that recognizing an impairment would have on pepco holdings assets as well as the net loss related to an impairment charge could be material 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that certain long lived assets must be tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss may only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the asset is deemed not to be recoverable when its carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
in order to estimate an asset s future cash flows  pepco holdings considers historical cash flows 
pepco holdings uses its best estimates in making these evaluations and considers various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  legislative initiatives  and operating costs 
if necessary  the process of determining fair value is done consistent with the process described in assessing the fair value of goodwill  which is discussed above 
for a discussion of phi s impairment losses during  refer to the impairment losses section in the accompanying consolidated results of operations discussion 
accounting for derivatives pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in accounting for its derivative instruments represent critical accounting estimates because i the fair value of the instruments are highly susceptible to changes in market value and or interest rate fluctuations  ii there are significant uncertainties in modeling techniques used to measure fair value in certain circumstances  iii actual results could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iv changes in fair values and market prices could result in material impacts to pepco holdings assets  liabilities  other comprehensive income loss  and results of operations 
see note  summary of significant accounting policies accounting for derivatives to the consolidated financial statements of phi included in item for information on phi s accounting for derivatives 
pepco holdings and its subsidiaries use derivative instruments primarily to manage risk associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  governs the accounting treatment for derivatives and requires that derivative instruments be measured at fair value 
the fair value of derivatives is determined using quoted exchange prices where available 
for instruments that are not traded on an exchange  external broker quotes are used to determine fair value 
for some custom and complex instruments  an internal model is used to interpolate broker quality price information 
the same valuation methods are used to determine the value of non derivative  commodity exposure for risk management purposes 
pension and other postretirement benefit plans pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in reporting the costs of providing pension and other postretirement benefits represent critical accounting estimates because i they are based on an actuarial calculation that includes a number of assumptions which are subjective in nature  ii they are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience  and iii changes in assumptions could impact pepco holdings expected future cash funding requirements for the plans and would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations  the reported pension and other postretirement benefit liability on the balance sheet  and the reported annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost on the income statement 
in terms of quantifying the anticipated impact of a change in assumptions  pepco holdings estimates that a 
change in the discount rate used to value the benefit obligations could result in a million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings 
additionally  pepco holdings estimates that a 
change in the expected return on plan assets could result in a million impact on the consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings and a 
change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate could result in a 
million impact on its consolidated balance sheets and statements of earnings 
pepco holdings management consults with its actuaries and investment consultants when selecting its plan assumptions 
pepco holdings follows the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r sfas no 
 when accounting for these benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
in accordance with these standards  the impact of changes in these assumptions and the difference between actual and expected or estimated results on pension and postretirement obligations is generally recognized over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans rather than immediately recognized in the statements of earnings 
plan assets are stated at their market value as of the measurement date  which is december regulation of power delivery operations the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  apply to the power delivery businesses of pepco  dpl  and ace 
pepco holdings believes that the judgment involved in accounting for its regulated activities represent critical accounting estimates because i a significant amount of judgment is required including but not limited to the interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders to assess the probability of the recovery of regulatory assets  ii actual results and interpretations could vary from those used in pepco holdings estimates and the impact of such variations could be material  and iii the impact that writing off a regulatory asset would have on pepco holdings assets and the net loss related to the charge could be material 
unbilled revenue unbilled revenue represents an estimate of revenue earned from services rendered by pepco holdings utility operations that have not yet been billed 
pepco holdings utility operations calculate unbilled revenue using an output based methodology 
this methodology is based on the supply of electricity or gas distributed to customers 
pepco holdings believes that the estimates involved in its unbilled revenue process represent critical accounting estimates because management is required to make assumptions and judgments about input factors such as customer sales mix and estimated power line losses estimates of electricity expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers  all of which are inherently uncertain and susceptible to change from period to period  the impact of which could be material 
accounting for income taxes pepco holdings and the majority of its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return 
pepco holdings accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes and effective january   adopted fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin clarifies the criteria for recognition of tax benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 and prescribes a financial statement recognition threshold and measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
specifically  it clarifies that an entity s tax benefits must be more likely than not of being sustained assuming that position will be examined by taxing authorities with full knowledge of all relevant information prior to recording the related tax benefit in the financial statements 
if the position drops below the more likely than not standard  the benefit can no longer be recognized 
assumptions  judgment and the use of estimates are required in determining if the more likely than not standard has been met when developing the provision for income taxes 
pepco holdings assumptions  judgments and estimates take into account current tax laws  interpretation of current tax laws and the possible outcomes of current and future investigations conducted by tax authorities 
pepco holdings has established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
although pepco holdings believes that these assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or its interpretation of tax laws and the resolutions of the current and any future investigations could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in the consolidated financial statements 
under sfas no 
 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded  representing future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes 
pepco holdings evaluates quarterly the probability of realizing deferred tax assets by reviewing a forecast of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented  if necessary  to realize deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income or successfully implement tax planning strategies may affect the realization of deferred tax assets

management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations potomac electric power company general overview potomac electric power company pepco is engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in washington  dc and major portions of montgomery county and prince george s county in suburban maryland 
pepco provides default electricity supply  which is the supply of electricity at regulated rates to retail customers in its territories who do not elect to purchase electricity from a competitive supplier  in both the district of columbia and maryland 
default electricity supply is known as standard offer service in both the district of columbia and maryland 
pepco s service territory covers approximately square miles and has a population of approximately million 
as of december   approximately of delivered electricity sales were to maryland customers and approximately were to washington  dc customers 
effective june   the maryland public service commission mpsc approved new electric service distribution base rates for pepco the maryland rate order 
the mpsc also approved a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism bsa for retail customers 
for customers to which the bsa applies  pepco recognizes distribution revenue based on an approved distribution charge per customer 
from a revenue recognition standpoint  the bsa thus decouples the distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period 
this change in the reporting of distribution revenue has the effect of eliminating changes in customer usage whether due to weather conditions  energy prices  energy efficiency programs or other reasons as a factor having an impact on reported revenue 
as a consequence  the only factors that will cause distribution revenue to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer

the decrease in the effective tax rate in was primarily the result of a maryland state income tax refund 
the refund was due to an increase in the tax basis of certain assets sold in  and as a result  pepco s income tax expense was reduced by million with a corresponding decrease to the effective tax rate of 
this decrease in the effective tax rate was partially offset by deferred tax basis adjustments and reduced book versus tax depreciation and amortization differences  which increased the year over year effective tax rate by and  respectively 
capital requirements capital expenditures pepco s total capital expenditures for the twelve months ended december   totaled million 
these expenditures were primarily related to capital costs associated with new customer services  distribution reliability and transmission 
the table below shows pepco s projected capital expenditures for the five year period through for the year total millions of dollars pepco distribution distribution blueprint for the future transmission mapp other pepco expects to fund these expenditures through internally generated cash and from external financing and capital contributions from phi 
distribution  transmission and gas delivery the projected capital expenditures for distribution other than blueprint for the future  transmission other than mapp and gas delivery are primarily for facility replacements and upgrades to accommodate customer growth and reliability 
blueprint for the future during  phi announced an initiative in pepco s service territory referred to as the blueprint for the future 
this initiative combines traditional energy efficiency programs with new technologies and systems to help customers manage their energy use and reduce the total cost of energy  and includes the installation of smart meters for all customers in the district of columbia and maryland 
pepco has made filings with the district of columbia public service commission and the mpsc for approval of certain aspects of these programs 
mapp project on october   pepco holdings received the approval of the pjm board of managers to build a new mile  kilovolt interstate transmission line as part of pjm s regional transmission expansion plan to address the reliability objectives of the pjm rto system 
the transmission line  which is referred to as the mapp project  will be located in northern virginia  maryland  the delmarva peninsula  and new jersey 
the preliminarily estimated cost of the kilovolt mapp project is approximately billion 
pepco s portion of the preliminary estimated cost of the kilovolt transmission line is approximately million 
construction is expected to occur in sections over a six year period with completion targeted by proceeds from settlement of mirant bankruptcy claims in  pepco sold substantially all of its electricity generating assets to mirant corporation mirant 
in  mirant commenced a voluntary bankruptcy proceeding in which it sought to reject certain obligations that it had undertaken in connection with the asset sale 
as part of the asset sale  pepco entered into transition power agreements with mirant pursuant to which mirant agreed to supply all of the energy and capacity needed by pepco to fulfill its sos obligations in maryland and in the district of columbia the tpas 
under a settlement to avoid the rejection by mirant of its obligations under the tpas in the bankruptcy proceeding  the terms of the tpas were modified to increase the purchase price of the energy and capacity supplied by mirant and pepco received an allowed  pre petition general unsecured claim in the bankruptcy in the amount of million the tpa claim 
in december  pepco sold the tpa claim  plus the right to receive accrued interest thereon  to an unaffiliated third party for million 
in addition  pepco received proceeds of 
million in settlement of an asbestos claim against the mirant bankruptcy estate 
after customer sharing  pepco recorded a pre tax gain of million from the settlement of these claims 
in connection with the asset sale  pepco and mirant also entered into a back to back arrangement  whereby mirant agreed to purchase from pepco the megawatts of electricity and capacity that pepco is obligated to purchase annually through from panda brandywine llp panda under a power purchase agreement the panda ppa at the purchase price pepco is obligated to pay to panda 
as part of the further settlement of pepco s claims against mirant arising from the mirant bankruptcy  pepco agreed not to contest the rejection by mirant of its obligations under the back to back arrangement in exchange for the payment by mirant of damages corresponding to the estimated amount by which the purchase price that pepco is obligated to pay panda for the energy and capacity exceeded the market price 
in  pepco received as damages million in net proceeds from the sale of shares of mirant common stock issued to it by mirant 
these funds are being accounted for as restricted cash based on management s intent to use such funds  and any interest earned thereon  for the sole purpose of paying for the future above market capacity and energy purchase costs under the panda ppa 
correspondingly  a regulatory liability has been established in the same amount to help offset the future above market capacity and energy purchase costs 
this restricted cash has been classified as a non current asset to be consistent with the classification of the non current regulatory liability  and any changes in the balance of this restricted cash  including interest on the invested funds  are being accounted for as operating cash flows 
as of december   the balance of the restricted cash account was million 
based on a reexamination of the costs of the panda ppa in light of current and projected wholesale market conditions conducted in the fourth quarter of  pepco determined that  principally due to increases in wholesale capacity prices  the present value above market cost of the panda ppa over the term of the agreement is expected to be significantly less than the current amount of the restricted cash account balance 
accordingly  on february   pepco filed applications with the dcpsc and the mpsc requesting orders directing pepco to maintain million in the restricted cash account and to use that cash  and any future earnings on the cash  for the sole purpose of paying the future above market cost of the panda ppa or  in the alternative  to fund a transfer or assignment of the remaining obligations under the panda ppa to a third party 
pepco also requested that the order provide that any cash remaining in the account at the conclusion of the panda ppa be refunded to customers and that any shortfall be recovered from customers 
pepco further proposed that the excess proceeds remaining from the settlement approximately million  representing the amount by which the regulatory liability of million at december  exceeded million be shared with its customers in accordance with the procedures previously approved by each commission for the sharing of the proceeds received by pepco from the sale to mirant of its generating assets 
the regulatory liability of million at december  differs from the restricted cash amount of million on that date  in part  because the regulatory liability has been reduced for the portion of the december panda charges in excess of market that had not yet been paid from the restricted cash account 
the amount of the restricted cash balance that pepco is permitted to retain will be recorded as earnings upon approval of the sharing arrangement by the respective commissions 
at this time  pepco cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings 
in settlement of other damages claims against mirant  pepco in also received a settlement payment in the amount of million 
of this amount i million was recorded as a reduction in operating expenses  ii million was recorded as a reduction in a net pre petition receivable claim from mirant  iii million was recorded as a reduction in the capitalized costs of certain property  plant and equipment and iv 
million was recorded as a liability to reimburse a third party for certain legal costs associated with the settlement

each of a n and odec assumed certain post closing liabilities and unknown pre closing liabilities related to the respective assets they are purchasing including  in the a n transaction  most environmental liabilities  except that dpl remained liable for unknown pre closing liabilities if they become known within six months after the january  closing date 
these sales resulted in an immaterial financial gain to dpl that will be recorded during the first quarter of effective june   the maryland public service commission mpsc approved new electric service distribution base rates for dpl the maryland rate order 
the mpsc also approved a bill stabilization adjustment mechanism bsa for retail customers 
for customers to which the bsa applies  dpl recognizes distribution revenue based on an approved distribution charge per customer 
from a revenue recognition standpoint  the bsa thus decouples the distribution revenue recognized in a reporting period from the amount of power delivered during the period 
this change in the reporting of distribution revenue has the effect of eliminating changes in customer usage whether due to weather conditions  energy prices  energy efficiency programs or other reasons as a factor having an impact on reported revenue 
as a consequence  the only factors that will cause distribution revenue to fluctuate from period to period are changes in the number of customers and changes in the approved distribution charge per customer

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management policies for phi and its subsidiaries are determined by phi s corporate risk management committee  the members of which are phi s chief risk officer  chief operating officer  chief financial officer  general counsel  chief information officer and other senior executives 
the corporate risk management committee monitors interest rate fluctuation  commodity price fluctuation  and credit risk exposure  and sets risk management policies that establish limits on unhedged risk and determine risk reporting requirements 
pepco holdings  inc commodity price risk phi s competitive energy businesses use derivative instruments primarily to reduce their financial exposure to changes in the value of their assets and obligations due to commodity price fluctuations 
the derivative instruments used by the competitive energy businesses include forward contracts  futures  swaps  and exchange traded and over the counter options 
in addition  the competitive energy businesses also manage commodity risk with contracts that are not classified as derivatives 
the two primary risk management objectives are to manage the spread between the cost of fuel used to operate electric generation plants and the revenue received from the sale of the power produced by those plants  and to manage the spread between retail sales commitments and the cost of supply used to service those commitments to ensure stable and known minimum cash flows  and lock in favorable prices and margins when they become available 
to a lesser extent  conectiv energy also engages in energy marketing activities 
energy marketing activities consist primarily of wholesale natural gas and fuel oil marketing  the activities of the short term power desk  which generates margin by capturing price differences between power pools  and locational and timing differences within a power pool  and prior to october   provided operating services under an agreement with an unaffiliated generating plant 
phi collectively refers to these energy marketing activities  including its commodity risk management activities  as other energy commodity activities and identifies this activity separately from the discontinued proprietary trading activity that was discontinued in the corporate risk management committee has the responsibility for establishing corporate compliance requirements for the competitive energy businesses energy market participation 
phi collectively refers to these energy market activities  including its commodity risk management activities  as other energy commodity activities 
phi does not engage in proprietary trading activities 
phi uses a value at risk var model to assess the market risk of its competitive energy businesses energy commodity activities 
phi also uses other measures to limit and monitor risk in its energy commodity activities  including limits on the nominal size of positions and periodic loss limits 
var represents the potential mark to market loss on energy contracts or portfolios due to changes in market prices for a specified time period and confidence level 
phi estimates var using a delta normal variance covariance model with a percent  one tailed confidence level and assuming a one day holding period 
since var is an estimate  it is not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur 
value at risk associated with energy contracts for the year ended december  millions of dollars proprietary trading var var for competitive energy activity a confidence level  one day holding period  one tailed period end average for the period high low a this column represents all energy derivative contracts  normal purchase and sales contracts  modeled generation output and fuel requirements and modeled customer load obligations for phi s other energy commodity activities 
for additional information about phi s derivative activities refer to note  accounting for derivatives and note  use of derivatives in energy and interest rate hedging activities of the consolidated financial statements of pepco holdings included in item a significant portion of the conectiv energy s portfolio of electric generating plants consists of mid merit assets and peaking assets 
mid merit electric generating plants are typically combined cycle units that can quickly change their megawatt output level on an economic basis 
these plants are generally operated during times when demand for electricity rises and power prices are higher 
conectiv energy economically hedges both the estimated plant output and fuel requirements as the estimated levels of output and fuel needs change 
economic hedge percentages include the estimated electricity output of conectiv energy s generation plants and any associated financial or physical commodity contracts including derivative contracts that are classified as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 other derivative instruments  wholesale normal purchase and sales contracts  and load service obligations 
conectiv energy maintains a forward month program with targeted ranges for economically hedging its projected on peak plant output combined with its on peak energy purchase commitments based on the then current forward electricity price curve as follows month target range the primary purpose of the risk management program is to improve the predictability and stability of margins by selling forward a portion of its projected plant output  and buying forward a portion of its projected fuel supply requirements 
within each period  hedged percentages can vary significantly above or below the average reported percentages 
as of december   the electricity sold forward by conectiv energy as a percentage of projected on peak plant output combined with on peak energy purchase commitments was   and for the month  month and month forward periods  respectively 
hedge percentages were above the target ranges for the month period due to conectiv energy s success in the default electricity supply auctions and a decrease in projected on peak plant output since the forward sale commitments were entered into 
the amount of forward on peak sales during the month period represents of conectiv energy s combined total on peak generating capability and on peak energy purchase commitments 
the volumetric percentages for the forward periods can vary and may not represent the amount of expected value hedged 
not all of the value associated with conectiv energy s generation activities can be hedged such as the portion attributable to ancillary services and fuel switching due to the lack of market products  market liquidity  and other factors 
also the hedging of locational value can be limited 
pepco energy services purchases electric and natural gas futures  swaps  options and forward contracts to hedge price risk in connection with the purchase of physical natural gas and electricity for delivery to customers 
pepco energy services accounts for its futures and swap contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions 
its options contracts are marked to market through current earnings 
its forward contracts are accounted for using standard accrual accounting since these contracts meet the requirements for normal purchase and sale accounting under sfas no 
credit and nonperformance risk pepco holdings subsidiaries attempt to minimize credit risk exposure to wholesale energy counterparties through  among other things  formal credit policies  regular assessment of counterparty creditworthiness and the establishment of a credit limit for each counterparty  monitoring procedures that include stress testing  the use of standard agreements which allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty and collateral requirements under certain circumstances  and have established reserves for credit losses 
as of december   credit exposure to wholesale energy counterparties was weighted with investment grade counterparties  with counterparties without external credit quality ratings  and with non investment grade counterparties 
this table provides information on the competitive energy businesses credit exposure  net of collateral  to wholesale counterparties 
schedule of credit risk exposure on competitive wholesale energy contracts millions of dollars december  rating a exposure before credit collateral b credit collateral c net exposure number of counterparties greater than d net exposure of counterparties greater than investment grade non investment grade no external ratings credit reserves a investment grade primarily determined using publicly available credit ratings of the counterparty 
if the counterparty has provided a guarantee by a higher rated entity eg  its parent  it is determined based upon the rating of its guarantor 
included in investment grade are counterparties with a minimum standard poor s or moody s investor service rating of bbb or baa  respectively 
b exposure before credit collateral includes the marked to market mtm energy contract net assets for open unrealized transactions  the net receivable payable for realized transactions and net open positions for contracts not subject to mtm 
amounts due from counterparties are offset by liabilities payable to those counterparties to the extent that legally enforceable netting arrangements are in place 
thus  this column presents the net credit exposure to counterparties after reflecting all allowable netting  but before considering collateral held
