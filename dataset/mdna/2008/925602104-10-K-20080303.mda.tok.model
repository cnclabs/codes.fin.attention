item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we research and develop biopharmaceutical products based on our patented dna delivery technologies for the prevention and treatment of serious or life threatening diseases 
we believe the following areas of research offer the greatest potential for our product development efforts vaccines for use in high risk populations for infectious disease targets for which there are significant us needs  vaccines for general pediatric  adolescent and adult populations for infectious disease applications  and cancer vaccines or immunotherapies which complement our existing programs and core expertise 
we currently have three active independent development programs in the areas of infectious disease and cancer including a phase clinical trial using our allovectin immunotherapeutic in patients with metastatic melanoma which is being funded by anges  through cash payments and equity investments  under a research and development agreement  a phase clinical trial using cmv dna vaccine in hematopoietic cell transplant patients  and a phase clinical trial using our pandemic influenza dna vaccine formulated with our proprietary vaxfectin adjuvant 
we have leveraged our patented technologies through licensing and collaboration arrangements  such as our licensing arrangements with merck  sanofi aventis  aqua health  merial  and anges  among other research driven biopharmaceutical companies 
these partnerships have resulted in the following two approvals in veterinary applications in  the first product for one of our licensees utilizing our patented dna delivery technology received approval for use in animals 
our licensee  aqua health received approval from the canadian food inspection agency to sell a dna vaccine to protect farm raised salmon against an infectious disease 
in  our licensee  merial received notification of conditional approval from the us department of agriculture to market a therapeutic dna vaccine designed to treat melanoma  a serious form of cancer  in dogs 
merial s vaccine is the first ever approved vaccine for therapeutic use 
we believe these approvals are important steps in the validation of our dna delivery technology 
furthermore  our partner  anges  is in the process of preparing an application for japanese approval of its dna based delivery product encoding the hepatocyte growth factor for indications related to peripheral arterial disease 
if approved  this would represent the first time our dna delivery technology is approved for use in humans 
in addition  we have licensed complementary technologies from leading research institutions and pharmaceutical companies  as well as the nih and the cdc 
we also have granted non exclusive  academic licenses to our dna delivery technology patent estate to ten leading research institutions including stanford  harvard  yale and the massachusetts institute of technology 
the non exclusive academic licenses allow university researchers to use our technology free of charge for educational and internal  non commercial research purposes 
in exchange  we have the option to exclusively license from the universities potential commercial applications stemming from their use of the technology on terms to be negotiated 

table of contents research  development and manufacturing programs to date  we have not received revenues from the sale of our independently developed pharmaceutical products and have received minimal amounts of revenue from the sale of commercially marketed products by our licensees 
we earn revenue by performing services under research and development contracts  grants  manufacturing contracts  and from licensing access to our proprietary technologies 
since our inception  we estimate that we have received approximately million in revenue under these types of agreements 
revenues by source for each of the three years ended december   were as follows in millions source nih contracts cmv grants influenza grants manufacturing process development grant anthrax grants us navy contract other contracts and grants total contract and grant revenues merck license anges license invitrogen royalties other royalties and licenses total royalty and license revenues total revenues research  development  manufacturing and production costs by major program  as well as other expenses for each of the three years ended december   were as follows in millions program allovectin pandemic influenza cmv other research  development  manufacturing and production total research  development  manufacturing and production since our inception  we estimate that we have spent approximately million on research  development  manufacturing and production 
our current independent development focus is on novel dna vaccines for our cancer immunotherapeutic allovectin  influenza and cmv  as well as other preclinical targets 
we have initiated a phase clinical trial using allovectin in patients with recurrent metastatic melanoma which is being funded  up to certain limits  by anges through cash payments and equity investments under a research and development agreement 
we are also in the early stages of clinical development of vaccine candidates for cmv and influenza and these programs will require significant additional costs to advance through development to commercialization 
from inception  we have spent approximately million on our allovectin program  million on our cmv program  and million on our influenza program 
we have other product candidates in the research stage 
it can take many years from the initial decision to screen product candidates  perform preclinical and safety studies  and perform clinical trials leading up to possible approval of a product by the fda or comparable foreign agencies 
the outcome of the research is unknown until each stage of the testing is completed  up through and including the registration clinical trials 

table of contents accordingly  we are unable to predict which potential product candidates we may proceed with  the time and cost to complete development  and ultimately whether we will have a product approved by the fda or comparable foreign agencies 
as a result  we expect to incur substantial operating losses for at least the next several years  due primarily to the advancement of our research and development programs  the cost of preclinical studies and clinical trials  spending for outside services  costs related to maintaining our intellectual property portfolio  costs due to contract manufacturing activities  costs of our facilities  and possible advancement toward commercialization activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that management make a number of assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical information and assumptions believed to be reasonable 
although these estimates are based on management s best knowledge of current events and circumstances that may impact us in the future  actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are those that affect our financial statements materially and involve a significant level of judgment by management 
our critical accounting policies regarding revenue recognition are in the following areas license and royalty agreements  manufacturing contracts  and grant revenues 
our critical accounting policies also include recognition of research and development expenses and the valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition and emerging issues task force no 
 or eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized when the four basic criteria of revenue recognition are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
contract manufacturing revenue 
our contract manufacturing arrangements typically require the delivery of multiple lots of clinical vaccines 
in accordance with eitf  we analyze our multiple element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting 
the evaluation is performed at the inception of the arrangement 
the delivered item s is considered a separate unit of accounting if all of the following criteria are met the delivered item s has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in our control 
if the delivered item does not have standalone value or if we do not have objective or reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered component  the amount of revenue allocable to the delivered item is deferred 
license and royalty revenue 
our license and royalty revenues are generated through agreements with strategic partners 
nonrefundable  up front license fees and milestone payments with standalone value that are not dependent on any future performance by us under the arrangements are recognized as revenue upon the earlier of when payments are received or collection is assured  but are deferred if we have continuing performance obligations 
if we have continuing involvement through contractual obligations under such agreement  such up front fees are deferred and recognized over the period for which we continue to have a performance obligation  unless all of the following criteria exist the delivered item s have standalone value to the customer  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item s  and delivery or performance is probable and within our control for any items that have a right of return 

table of contents we recognize royalty revenues from licensed products when earned in accordance with the terms of the license agreements 
net sales figures used for calculating royalties include deductions for costs of returns  cash discounts  and freight and warehousing  which may vary over the course of the license agreement 
payments received related to milestones are recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the milestones as specified in the underlying agreements  which represent the culmination of the earnings process 
government research grant revenue 
we recognize revenues from federal government research grants during the period in which the related expenditures are incurred 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities including salaries and benefits  facilities and other overhead expenses  clinical trials  contract services and other outside expenses 
research and development expenses are charged to operations as they are incurred 
we assess our obligations to make milestone payments that may become due under licensed or acquired technology to determine whether the payments should be expensed or capitalized 
we charge milestone payments to research and development expense when the technology is in the early stage of development and has no alternative uses  there is substantial uncertainty of the technology or product being successful  there will be difficulty in completing the remaining development  and there is substantial cost to complete the work 
capitalization and valuation of long lived and intangible assets intangible assets with finite useful lives consist of capitalized legal costs incurred in connection with patents  patent applications pending and technology license agreements 
payments to acquire a license to use a proprietary technology are capitalized if the technology is expected to have alternative future use in multiple research and development projects 
we amortize costs of approved patents  patent applications pending and license agreements over their estimated useful lives  or terms of the agreements  whichever are shorter 
for patents pending  we amortize the costs over the shorter of a period of twenty years from the date of filing the application or  if licensed  the term of the license agreement 
we re assess the useful lives of patents when they are issued  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the useful lives may have changed 
for patents and patent applications pending that we abandon  we charge the remaining unamortized accumulated costs to expense 
intangible assets and long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
if the review indicates that intangible assets or long lived assets are not recoverable  their carrying amount would be reduced to fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  and or a significant negative industry or economic trend 
in the event we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets or long lived assets is not recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
as of december   our largest group of intangible assets with finite lives includes patents and patents pending for our dna delivery technology  consisting of intangible assets with a net carrying value of approximately million

results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  total revenues 
total revenues decreased million  or  to million in from million in revenues from our contracts and grants were million in as compared to million in this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in contract manufacturing revenue which totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and was related to our subcontract agreement with the vrc which expired in july research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million for from million for this increase was primarily attributable to increased costs associated with our allovectin phase clinical trial  our cmv phase clinical trial and our pandemic influenza phase clinical trial 
manufacturing and production expenses 
manufacturing and production expenses increased million  or  to million for from million for this increase was primarily attributable to the recognition of the remaining estimated costs to be incurred in connection with the remanufacture of the final vaccine component under our manufacturing subcontract agreement with the vrc  which was partially offset by lower costs for scientific supplies purchased to support manufacturing in the prior year 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses remained unchanged at million 
the expenses were substantially consistent with the prior period 
investment income 
investment income was million in as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances and higher rates of return in interest expense 
interest expense was million in as compared to million in the decrease was the result of lower principal amounts outstanding on our equipment financing obligations 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  total revenues 
total revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in revenues from our contracts and grants were million in as compared to million in the increase in contract and grant revenue was due primarily to a million increase in manufacturing contract shipments to the vrc under our nih agreement  which was partially offset by decreases in grant revenue and contract shipments to the us navy 
license and royalty revenues were million in as compared to million in in  we recognized million in license and milestone revenues related to merck s use of our technology for the development of specific cancer targets 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase was primarily a result of increased clinical trial expenses as a result of preparations for our allovectin phase trial  initiation of our phase cmv trial and increased stock compensation expense related to the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment 
manufacturing and production expenses 
manufacturing and production expenses increased million  or  to million for from million for this increase was primarily the result of the recognition of contract manufacturing costs associated with the shipment of clinical lots of dna vaccines to the vrc during the current period 
this increase was offset by a decrease in facility related costs in the current 
table of contents period as a result of the shutdown of one of our facilities in the prior period and a decrease in the use of scientific supplies used in the manufacturing process 
the primary focus of manufacturing and production during the year ended december   was the production of plasmids for programs under clinical development and the fulfillment of commitments under manufacturing contracts 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase was primarily the result of increased stock compensation expense related to the implementation of sfas no 
r and increased consulting and legal fees related to general business matters 
investment income 
investment income was million in as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to higher average cash and investment balances and higher rates of return in interest expense 
interest expense was million in as compared to million in the decrease was the result of lower principal amounts outstanding on our equipment financing obligations 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of preferred and common stock  public offerings of common stock  and revenues from collaborative agreements 
from our inception through december   we have received approximately million in revenues from performing services under research and development contracts  grants  and manufacturing contracts  and from licensing access to our proprietary technologies  and we have raised net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of equity securities 
as of december   we had working capital of approximately million  compared with million at december  cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including restricted securities  totaled approximately million at december   compared with million at december  the decrease in our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities for the year ended december   was due primarily to the use of cash to fund our operations 
net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december   compared with the same period in the prior year  was primarily the result of an increase in our net loss due to advancement of our clinical trials 
the increase in net loss was partially offset by increased cash flows from the timing of cash receipts related to receivables and deferred revenue 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december   compared with the prior year  was primarily the result of an increase in net maturities of investments 
net cash used in provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cash used by financing activities for the year ended december   compared with the prior year  was primarily the result of a decrease in net proceeds from the sale of our common stock 
we expect to incur substantial additional research and development expenses  manufacturing and production expenses  and general and administrative expenses  including continued increases in personnel costs  costs related to preclinical and clinical testing  outside services  facilities  intellectual property and possible commercialization costs 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in our research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical testing and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting  enforcing and defending patent claims  the impact of competing technological and market developments  the cost of manufacturing scale up  and possible commercialization activities and arrangements 

table of contents we may seek additional funding through research and development relationships with suitable potential corporate collaborators 
we may also seek additional funding through public or private financings 
we have on file two effective shelf registration statements that in the aggregate allow us to raise up to an additional million from the sale of common or preferred stock 
however  additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
if additional funding is not available  we anticipate that our available cash and existing sources of funding will be adequate to satisfy our cash needs through at least december  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table sets forth our contractual obligations  including all off balance sheet arrangements  as of december  in thousands payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years operating lease obligations equipment financing obligations unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations certain long term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet are not presented in this table because they are already reflected in operating lease commitments  or do not require cash settlement in the future 
unconditional purchase obligations represent contractual commitments entered into for goods and services in the normal course of our business 
the purchase obligations do not include potential severance payment obligations to our executive officers 
for information regarding these severance arrangements  refer to the final paragraph in this item in december  we modified an equipment financing agreement which provided for million of financing  with interest rates ranging from to 
a portion of the financing was used to repay outstanding debt of approximately million under another credit facility 
additional amounts were used to finance equipment purchases 
the draw down period for this equipment financing arrangement ended in october the agreement requires a non interest bearing cash security deposit in the amount of of the amount of each drawdown which amounts are included in current and long term other assets 
this financing involves restrictive financial covenants  including a requirement that we maintain unrestricted cash and marketable securities of at least million or obtain a letter of credit from another lender in the amount of outstanding borrowings 
under the merck  sanofi aventis  anges  merial and aqua health agreements  we are required to pay up to of certain initial upfront monetary payments  and a small percentage of some royalty payments  to the warf 
the cytrx  bioject  university of michigan  university of massachusetts  wistar institute  and other license agreements require us to make payments if we or our sublicensees advance products through clinical development 
for programs developed with the support of us government funding  the us government may have rights to resulting products without payment of royalties 
in addition  we have undertaken certain commitments under license agreements with collaborators  and under indemnification agreements with our officers and directors 
under the license agreements with our collaborators  we have agreed to continue to maintain and defend the patent rights licensed to the collaborators 
under the indemnification agreements with our officers and directors  we have agreed to indemnify those individuals for any expenses and liabilities in the event of a threatened  pending or actual investigation  lawsuit  or criminal or investigative proceeding 

table of contents as of december   we have employment agreements that contain severance arrangements with each of our three executive officers and our five other executives 
under these agreements  we are obligated to pay severance if we terminate such an executive officer s or other executive s employment without cause  or if such an executive officer or other executive resigns for good reason  as defined in the agreements  within the periods set forth therein 
the severance would consist of continued payments at the current base compensation rate  or current base compensation rate plus the prior year s cash bonus in the case of the ceo  for the period specified in each agreement  which ranges from six to twelve months 
these agreements also specify that any earnings from employment or consulting during this period will offset any salary continuation payments due from us 
the maximum payments due under these employment agreements would have been million if each such executive officer and other executive was terminated at december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk primarily in the area of changes in united states interest rates and conditions in the credit markets 
we do not have any material foreign currency or other derivative financial instruments 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we attempt to increase the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
our investment portfolio is maintained in accordance with our investment policy which defines allowable investments  specifies credit quality standards and limits the credit exposure of any single issuer 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
the average maturity of our non equity investments is approximately nine months 
our investments are classified as available for sale securities 
to assess our interest rate risk  we performed a sensitivity analysis projecting an ending fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities using the following assumptions a month time horizon  a month average maturity and a basis point increase in interest rates 
this pro forma fair value would have been million lower than the reported fair value of our non equity investments at december  at december   our unrealized loss on marketable securities was million 
all of our investment securities are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on the balance sheet at market value 
our investment securities consist of high grade auction rate securities  corporate debt securities and government agency securities 
as of february   our short term investments included million of high grade aaa rated auction rate securities secured by municipal bonds and student loans 
our auction rate securities are debt instruments with a long term maturity and with an interest rate that is reset in short intervals through auctions 
the recent conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities 
if there is insufficient demand for the securities at the time of an auction  the auction may not be completed and the interest rates may be reset to predetermined higher rates 
when auctions for these securities fail  the investments may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful or they are redeemed or mature 
if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate and any decline in market value is determined to be other than temporary  we would be required to adjust the carrying value of the investment through an impairment charge 
to date  we have not recorded any realized gains or losses on our investment portfolio or recognized any significant unrealized gains or losses on investments 
in february  we were informed that there was insufficient demand at auctions for three of our high grade auction rate securities  representing approximately million 
as a result  these affected securities are currently not liquid and the interest rates have been reset to the predetermined higher rates 
we may experience a similar situation with our remaining million of auction rate securities 

table of contents in the event we need to access the funds that are in an illiquid state  we will not be able to do so without the possible loss of principal  until a future auction for these investments is successful or they are redeemed by the issuer or they mature 
at this time  we have not obtained sufficient evidence to conclude that these investments are impaired or that they will not be settled in the short term  although the market for these investments is presently uncertain 
if we are unable to sell these securities in the market or they are not redeemed  then we may be required to hold them to maturity 
we do not have a need to access these funds for operational purposes for the foreseeable future 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate these investments on an ongoing basis for impairment or for a short term to a long term reclassification 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate that the potential illiquidity of these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan
