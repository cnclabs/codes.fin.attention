item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ substantially from those anticipated as a result of many factors including those set forth under the caption risk factors  included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements  the related notes thereto and the other financial information included elsewhere in the document 

table of contents overview we are a leading designer and manufacturer of optical modules and components which enable high speed telecommunications and data communications networks globally 
in particular  we design  manufacture and market optical modules and components that transmit and receive data and are primarily used in telecommunications and data communications networks 
we have one of the most comprehensive transceiver product portfolios for both of these markets  particularly at the gbps and above data rates  which we sell to many of the leading network systems vendors 
our product portfolio includes a broad range of solutions that vary by level of integration  communications protocol  form factor and performance level 
our portfolio primarily consists of gbps and gbps transceiver modules  including tunable transceivers  a broad line of gbps and lower speed sfp transceivers and new or planned products for emerging high speed markets  such as gbe and gbps 
we were incorporated as a wholly owned subsidiary of hitachi  ltd  or hitachi  in september of in july of  clarity partners  lp and related investment vehicles invested in us and we became a majority owned subsidiary of hitachi 
on october   we acquired of the shares of opto device  ltd 
from hitachi for a purchase price of million 
this acquisition of hitachi s opto device business expanded our product line into select industrial and commercial markets  which we refer to as our industrial and commercial products 
on june  we acquired of the outstanding shares of pine photonics communication inc  or pine  in exchange for  shares of our then class b common stock 
this acquisition expanded our product line of sfp transceivers with data rates less than gbps that are sold to telecommunication and data communication customers 
we refer to these products  together with our legacy gbps custom modules  as our less than gbps products 
since our founding  we expanded our global sales and marketing reach by opening several offices in the us  europe and china which are strategically located in close proximity to our major customers 
we established a corporate administrative headquarters and established our own operating infrastructure as we significantly reduced the nature and extent of services provided by hitachi 
we also integrated the acquisitions of opto device  ltd 
and pine and improved the flexibility of our manufacturing processes by expanding the use of contract manufacturers 
in february  we completed our initial public offering of common stock with net proceeds to us from the offering of million 
the following are factors that may affect our future financial condition and results of operations sales through our direct sales force supported by manufacturer representatives and distributors  we sell products to many of the leading network systems vendors throughout north america  europe  japan and asia 
our customers include many of the top telecommunications and data communications network systems vendors in the world 
we also supply components to several major transceiver module companies and sell to select industrial and commercial customers 
sales to telecommunication and data communication customers  our communication sales  accounted for  and of our sales during each of the years ended march   and  respectively 
also during each of the years ended march   and  sales of our products with gbps or higher data rates  which we refer to as our gbps and above products  represented  and of total sales  respectively 
the number of leading network systems vendors that supply the global telecommunications and data communications markets is concentrated  and so  in turn  is our customer base 
for the year ended march   our top two customers  cisco systems inc and subsidiaries  cisco  and alcatel lucent accounted for and of our sales  respectively 
although we continue to attempt to expand our customer base  we anticipate that these customers will generally continue to represent a significant portion of our customer base and be responsible for significant percentages of our revenues 
the evaluation and qualification cycle prior to the initial sale of our products generally spans a year or more 
although we negotiate the sale of our products directly with most of our customers  certain purchase orders for our 
table of contents products are received from contract manufacturers on behalf of several of our network systems vendor customers following our direct negotiation with the respective customers 
our revenues are affected by capital spending for telecommunications and data communications networks and for lasers and infrared leds used in select industrial and commercial markets 
the primary markets for our products continue to be characterized by increasing volumes and declining average selling prices 
the increasing demand for our products is primarily driven by increases in traditional telecommunication and data communication traffic and increasing demand from new communication applications such as voip voice over internet protocol  peer to peer file sharing  ip tv  video conferencing  on line gaming and advanced wireless services  as well as new industrial and commercial laser applications 
the decreasing price trends are primarily the result of industry over capacity  increased competition and the introduction of next generation products 
we anticipate that our average selling prices will continue to decrease in future periods  although we cannot predict the extent of these decreases for any particular period 
we began to sell high powered red laser diodes for the rewriteable dvd market to a subsidiary of hitachi during the year ended march  subsequently  the market experienced a rapid pace of new product introductions and significant price erosion and we experienced significant losses from sales of these products 
during the quarter ended december   we notified hitachi s subsidiary of our intention to discontinue sales of our dvd products and then agreed to a last time buy arrangement whereby we continued to sell our dvd products through september in exchange for a price increase on orders received after december  sales of dvd products were million and million in the years ended march  and  respectively 
we operate sales and marketing offices in several countries 
during the years ended march   and  revenues attributed to sales in the united states were  and of revenues  revenues attributed to sales in europe were  and of revenues  revenues attributed to sales in japan were  and of revenues  and revenues attributed to sales in asia pacific were  and of revenues  respectively 
our sales are exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because certain sales transactions and the related assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the japanese yen and the euro 
to the extent we generate sales in currencies other than the us dollar  our future sales will be affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
cost of sales and gross margin our cost of sales primarily consists of materials including components that are either assembled at one of our three internal manufacturing facilities or at one of several of our contract manufacturing partners or procured from third party vendors 
due to the complexity and proprietary nature of laser manufacturing  and the advantage of having our internal manufacturing resources co located with our research and development staffs  most of the lasers used in our optical module and component products are manufactured in our facilities in komoro and totsuka  japan 
our materials include certain parts and components that are purchased from a limited number of suppliers or in certain situations from a single supplier 
our cost of sales also includes labor costs for employees and contract laborers engaged in the production of our components and the assembly of our finished goods  outsourcing costs  the cost and related depreciation of manufacturing equipment  as well as manufacturing overhead costs  including the costs for product warranty repairs and inventory adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory 
our cost of sales is exposed to market risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because a significant portion of our costs and the related assets and liabilities are denominated in japanese yen 
our cost of sales denominated in japanese yen during the years ended march   and were  and  respectively 
while we anticipate that we will continue to have a substantial portion of our cost of sales denominated in japanese yen  we anticipate the percentage of cost of sales denominated in japanese yen to diminish as we plan to expand the use of contract manufacturers outside of japan and procure more raw materials in us dollars 
our gross margins vary among our product lines and are generally higher on our gbps and above products 
our overall gross margins primarily fluctuate as a result of our overall sales volumes  changes in average selling 
table of contents prices and product mix  the introduction of new products and subsequent generations of existing products  manufacturing yields  our ability to reduce product costs and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our gross margins vary among our product lines and are generally higher on our gbps and above products 
our overall gross margins primarily fluctuate as a result of our overall sales volumes  changes in average selling prices and product mix  the introduction of new products and subsequent generations of existing products  manufacturing yields  our ability to reduce product costs and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
research and development costs research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits of personnel related to the design  development and quality testing of new products or enhancement of existing products as well as outsourced services provided by hitachi s renowned research laboratories pursuant to our long term contractual agreements 
we incurred million  million and million in connection with these agreements during the years ended march   and  respectively 
in addition  our research and development costs primarily include the cost of developing prototypes and material costs associated with the testing of products prior to shipment  the cost and related depreciation of equipment used in the testing of products prior to shipment  and other contract research and development related services 
we expect that our future research and development costs will increase with our efforts to meet the anticipated increased market demand for our new and planned future products and to support enhancements to our existing products 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for our employees that perform our sales and related support  marketing  supply chain management  finance  legal  information technology  human resource and other general corporate functions  as well as internal and outsourced logistics and distribution costs  commissions paid to our manufacturers representatives  professional fees and other corporate related expenses 
during the year ended march   we experienced an increase in costs as a result of being a publicly traded company  including  but not limited to  the costs of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of we anticipate that our future selling  general and administrative expenses will primarily rise as a result of higher sales volumes in the future 
inventory certain of our more significant customers have implemented a supply chain management tool called vendor managed inventory vmi programs which require suppliers  such as us  to assume responsibility for maintaining an agreed upon level of consigned inventory at the customer s location or at a third party logistics provider  based on the customer s demand forecast 
notwithstanding the fact that we build and ship the inventory  the customer does not purchase the consigned inventory until the inventory is drawn or pulled by the customer or third party logistics provider to be used in the manufacture of the customer s product 
though the consigned inventory may be at the customer s or third party logistics provider s physical location  it remains inventory owned by us until the inventory is drawn or pulled  which is the time at which the sale takes place 
given that under such programs we are subject to the production schedule and inventory management decisions of the customer or third party logistics provider  our participation in vmi programs could result in our experiencing higher levels of inventory than we might otherwise 
as of march   inventories included inventory consigned to customers or their third party logistics providers pursuant to vmi arrangements of million 
significant accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition  warranties and allowances revenue is derived principally from the sales of our products 
we recognize revenue when the basic criteria of staff accounting bulletin no 
are met 
specifically  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists usually in the form of a purchase order  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured in terms of both credit worthiness of the customer and there are no uncertainties with respect to customer 
table of contents acceptance 
these conditions generally exist upon shipment or upon notice from certain customers in japan that they have completed their inspection and have accepted the product 
we participate in vmi programs with certain of our customers  whereby we maintain an agreed upon quantity of certain products at a customer designated warehouse 
revenue pursuant to the vmi programs is recognized when the products are physically pulled by the customer  or its designated contract manufacturer  and put into production 
simultaneous with the inventory pulls  purchase orders are received from the customer  or its designated contract manufacturer  as evidence that a purchase request and delivery have occurred and that title has passed to the customer at a previously agreed upon price 
we sell certain of our products to customers with a product warranty that provides repairs at no cost or the issuance of credit to the customer 
the length of the warranty term depends on the product being sold  ranging from one year to five years 
we accrue the estimated exposure to warranty claims based upon historical claim costs as a percentage of sales multiplied by prior sales still under warranty at the end of any period 
our management reviews these estimates on a regular basis and adjusts the warranty provisions as actual experience differs from historical estimates or as other information becomes available 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based upon historical payment patterns  aging of accounts receivable and actual write off history  as well as assessment of customers creditworthiness 
changes in the financial condition of customers could have an effect on the allowance balance required and result in a related charge or credit to earnings 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods  including inventory consigned to our customers and our contract manufacturers 
inventory valuation and firm committed purchase order assessments are performed on a quarterly basis and those items which are identified to be obsolete or in excess of forecasted usage are written down to their estimated realizable value 
estimates of realizable value are based upon management s analyses and assumptions  including  but not limited to  forecasted sales levels by product  expected product lifecycle  product development plans and future demand requirements 
we typically use a twelve month rolling forecast based on factors including  but not limited to  our production cycles  anticipated product orders  marketing forecasts  backlog  shipment activities and inventories owned by and held at our customers 
if market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts or actual demand from our customers is lower than our estimates  we may require additional inventory write downs 
if demand is higher than expected  inventories that had previously been written down may be sold at prices in excess of the written down value 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that such asset will not be realized 
as of march   we have a us federal net operating loss carryforward of approximately million and a foreign net operating loss carryforward of approximately million to offset future taxable income 
the us federal net operating loss carryforward excludes million of pre acquisition losses of a subsidiary which are subject to certain annual limitations under section of the internal revenue code 
the us federal net operating loss carryforward will expire between and and the foreign net operating loss carryforward will expire between and in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at march  and  management 
table of contents considered recent operating results  the near term earnings expectations  and the highly competitive nature of our markets in making this assessment 
at the end of each of the respective years  management determined that it was more likely than not that the tax benefit of the deferred tax assets would not be realized 
accordingly  full valuation allowances have been provided against the net deferred tax assets 
there can be no assurances that deferred tax assets subject to our valuation allowance will ever be realized 
impairment of long lived assets impairment of long lived assets are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
in estimating future cash flows  assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of cash flows from other groups 
assumptions underlying future cash flow estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties 
our evaluations for the years ended march   and indicated that there were no impairments 
stock based incentive plans in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment 
this statement requires all share based payments to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value 
we adopted sfas no 
r on april   using the modified prospective method 
this method requires compensation cost for the unvested portion of awards that are outstanding as of march  to be recognized over the remaining service period based on the grant date fair value of those awards as previously calculated for pro forma disclosures under statement no 
all new awards and awards that are modified  repurchased  or cancelled after march  are accounted for under the provisions of statement no 
r 
compensation expense for all employee stock based plans was million and million for the years ended march  and  respectively 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
r  we estimate the fair value of our share based awards utilizing the black scholes pricing model 
the fair value of the awards is amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the vesting period 
the fair value calculations involve significant judgments  assumptions  estimates and complexities that impact the amount of compensation expense to be recorded in current and future periods 
the factors include the time period our stock based awards are expected to remain outstanding has been determined based on the average of the original award period and the remaining vesting period in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin simplified method 
our expected term assumption for awards issued during the years ended march  and was years 
as additional evidence develops from our stock s trading history  the expected term assumption will be refined to capture the relevant trends 
through december   the future volatility of our stock was estimated based on the median calculated value of the historical volatility of companies believed to have similar market performance characteristics as those of our company 
use of comparable companies was necessary during this period since we did not possess a sufficient stock price history 
subsequent to december   we estimated volatility based on our historical stock prices 
the expected volatility assumption for awards issued during the twelve month period ending march  and was and  respectively 
a dividend yield of zero has been assumed for awards issued during the years ended march  and based on our actual past experience and the fact that we do not anticipate paying a dividend on our shares in the near future 

table of contents we have based our risk free interest rate assumption for awards issued during the years ended march  and on the implied weighted average yields of and  respectively  available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent expected term 
forfeiture rates for awards issued during the years ended march  and have been estimated based on our company s actual historical forfeiture trends of approximately over their expected terms 
prior to april   we accounted for our stock based incentive plans in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which requires entities to disclose pro forma net income or loss as if the fair value of share based awards were expensed 
for pro forma disclosure purposes  the estimated fair value was amortized to expense over the vesting period 
if we had elected to adopt the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
for our stock based incentive plans  our net loss would have decreased by million in the year ended march  use of estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the periods reported 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
these estimates include assessment of the ability to collect accounts receivable  the use and recoverability of inventory  the realization of deferred tax assets  expected warranty costs  fair value of stock awards and estimated useful lives for depreciation and amortization periods of tangible assets  among others 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and the estimates will change under different assumptions or conditions 
pending adoption of new accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
provides accounting guidance on the definition of fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
on february   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp which delays the effective date of sfas no 
for one year for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
sfas no 
and fsp are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we have elected a partial deferral of sfas no 
under the provisions of fsp related to the measurement of fair value used when evaluating goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment and valuing asset retirement obligations and liabilities for exit or disposal activities 
the impact of partially adopting statement effective april  is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits but does not require entities to choose to measure financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  as we have not elected to measure any of our financial instruments at fair value under the provisions of statement  the adoption of this statement will not have any impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations 
sfas no 
r retains the fundamental requirements in sfas no 
that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
this statement improves the relevance  completeness  and representational faithfulness of the information provided in financial reports about the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in a business combination 
sfas no 
r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date to be measured at their fair values and also requires that acquisition related costs be expensed as 
table of contents incurred and services are received  except for the costs to issue debt and equity securities 
this statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is not permitted
