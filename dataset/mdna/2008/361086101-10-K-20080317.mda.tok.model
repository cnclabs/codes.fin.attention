actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant policies are presented in the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented under item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial position and results of operations 
these policies require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often employing the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s most critical accounting policies pertain to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  the impairment of goodwill and income taxes 
critical accounting policies are discussed regularly  at least quarterly  with the company s audit committee 
goodwill and intangible assets the company follows sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminates the amortization for goodwill  excess of cost over fair value of net assets of acquired businesses  and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
under sfas no 
 intangible assets with lives restricted by contractual  legal or other means will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
at december  and  the company had no significant intangible assets subject to amortization under sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
sfas no 
requires a two step process for testing impairment 
first  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine whether an indication of impairment exists 
second  if an impairment is indicated  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the unit s fair value to its assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible 
table of contents assets  as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
the amount of impairment for goodwill and other intangible assets is measured as the excess of the carrying value over the implied fair value 
based on valuations and analysis performed by the company at december  and  no impairment charge was required 
at december   the company determined that the carrying value of a portion of its goodwill related to the government services business exceeded the implied fair value and recorded a non cash charge to operating costs of million 
as a result of the shifting focus to the technical services business combined with the results of the goodwill impairment calculation using the market capitalization method  it was determined that the goodwill for the healthcare services business would be written off 
future evaluations of the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets are dependent on many factors  several of which are out of the company s control  including the demand for services provided 
to the extent that such factors or conditions change  it is possible that future impairments could occur  which could have a material effect on the results of operations of the company

 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the company recognizes revenues under a multiple deliverable arrangement when there are separable deliverables or separate units of accounting 
analysis is performed at the inception of the arrangement and as each product or service is delivered 
revenues are allocated to separate units of accounting when all of the following criteria are met the delivered item has value to the customer on a standalone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered item  delivery  or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in our control 
the company uses the residual method to allocate value to the delivered and undelivered items 
under the residual method  the company determines the fair value of the undelivered items then subtracts this value from the total arrangement consideration to determine the value attributable to the delivered items 
the undelivered items are deferred until those items have been delivered and then are recognized as revenues 
if a product or service is not separable  the combined deliverables are accounted for as a single unit of accounting and recognized as revenues when all elements have been delivered

new accounting pronouncements in september  the sec issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab was issued to provide consistency between how registrants quantify financial statement misstatements 
historically  there have been two widely used methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements  the roll over method and the iron curtain method 
while the roll over method primarily quantifies the amount by which the current year income statement is misstated  the iron curtain method primarily quantifies the error as the cumulative amount by which the current year balance sheet is misstated 
sab established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatement on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this approach is commonly referred to as the dual approach because it requires quantification of errors under both the roll over and iron curtain methods 
pursuant to the provisions of sab  the company evaluated the effect of the dual approach method as of december  and compared its effect to the roll over method that the company had historically used 
the company recorded the cumulative effect of adopting sab as an adjustment to the balance of retained earnings as of january  the total adjustment of million represents an increase to retained earnings of million for foreign deferred tax credits not previously recognized  million for a reduction in previously provided foreign tax contingencies and million related to a gain on sale of assets  all of which relate to prior periods

 fair value measurements  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value under other accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements and expands disclosures about such measurements 
sfas no

sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  the company will adopt this standard in and is currently evaluating the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
sfas no 
requires an employer to recognize the funded status of each pension and other post retirement benefit plan as an asset or liability on their balance sheet with all unrecognized amounts to be recorded in other comprehensive income 
as required  the company adopted this provision of sfas no 
and initially applied it to the funded status of the pension plan as of december  the standard also ultimately requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position 
as required  the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
relative to measurement date for the fiscal year ending 
table of contents december  the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  that the measurement date provision of sfas no 
will have on its consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities
