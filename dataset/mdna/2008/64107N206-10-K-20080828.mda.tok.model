item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends and material developments affecting our business acquisition of bgs smartcard systems ag 
market opportunity according to the united states census bureau  the world s population currently exceeds billion people 
yet of this total  it has been reported that over four billion people earn less than the purchasing parity equivalent of two dollars per day 
in general  these people either have no bank account or very limited access to banking services 
this situation arises when banking fees are too high relative to an individual s income  a bank account provides little or no meaningful benefit or there is insufficient infrastructure to provide banking services economically in the individual s geographic location 
we refer to these people as the unbanked and the under banked 
these individuals generally receive wages  welfare benefits  money transfers or loans in the form of cash and conduct commercial transactions  including buying food and clothing  in cash 
the use of cash  however  presents significant problems 
in the case of recipients  they generally have no secure way of protecting their cash other than by converting it immediately into goods  carrying it with them or hiding it 
in cases where an individual has access to a bank account  the typical deposit  withdrawal and account fees meaningfully reduce the money available to meet basic needs 
for government agencies and employers  using cash to pay welfare benefits or wages results in significant expense due to the logistics of obtaining that cash  moving it to distribution points and protecting it from theft 
the use of cash or lack of access to a bank account can dramatically increase the cost to  and in some cases completely prevent  individuals from engaging in basic financial transactions 
these basic transactions include the routine payment of insurance premiums  the transfer of money to relatives and the use of credit 
without a bank account  it is also difficult for an individual to obtain a loan on attractive terms since that individual lacks a credit history and usually cannot present a reliable means of repayment to the lender 
for governments  assistance programs face significant challenges when dependent on the use of cash 
in addition to the costs and difficulties of using cash  corruption becomes an even more challenging problem since there is no clear audit trail 
in fact  the absence of an electronic system for the distribution of goods  including foodstuff or medicine  or welfare benefits presents a significant obstacle to ensuring the fair and reliable implementation of government policy or deployment of foreign aid 
traditional payment systems offered today by the major banking institutions do not address the key requirements of the unbanked and the under banked populations 
in addition to the high cost of maintaining a bank account relative to a customer s income level  customers must generally have basic literacy  administrative and record keeping abilities and a minimum income level 
additionally  banks operate through online transaction settlement systems  which are often unavailable or costly to implement in undeveloped areas 
finally  having a bank account does not eliminate the need for significant quantities of cash in many instances because customers must withdraw large sums at one time to avoid incremental transaction fees 
our solution we believe that we are the first company to enable the affordable delivery of financial products and services to the world s unbanked and under banked people 
our approach takes full advantage of moving processing away from a centralized point to the computer chip embedded on a smart card 
a smart card reader  or pos device  is used to enable communication between smart cards in real time during a transaction and indirectly with our mainframe computer at a later time 
this architecture has significant implications in terms of the products and services that we can deliver compared to those offered by banking institutions or other card providers 
first  our system enables offline transactions  which is essential in serving the unbanked and under banked 
second  it means that while offline  the smart card can engage in sophisticated transaction processing  using data encryption and biometric fingerprint protection to ensure security 
in fact  our smart cards can calculate the interest owed to the card holder for having funds recorded onto our system without ever coming online 
third  with all of the software and transaction records on the smart card  the pos device itself requires far fewer components  circuitry and memory  substantially reducing costs 
fourth  each transaction is recorded on both participating smart cards  copied in subsequent transactions to additional smart cards  and ultimately reported to our mainframe computer 
this creates a full audit trail that significantly reduces the potential for corruption  theft and fraud 
lastly  instead of having to build the overall system to handle peak loads  our system further reduces costs by smoothing the transaction flow over time 
we believe that our solution delivers benefits to each of the users of our system  including individuals 
there is no minimum income requirement for individuals to use our smart card  making our solution universally accessible 
it is also inexpensive since the overall cost of the system is much less than widely available solutions  including cash  bank accounts and bank cards that require online access 
our solution additionally has the advantage of working everywhere  including remote areas where many unbanked and under banked people live 
even more importantly  our solution is secure and smart cards are replaceable 
this means that individuals do not have to fear that their money will be stolen or that they will be charged for fraudulent transactions as all transactions are verified biometrically through fingerprints 
since the smart card performs all of the required computing processing and contains all of the different service features  the smart card can be tailored to meet the needs of the individual 
card holders can also receive interest on their card balances  a benefit not available to them when transacting solely in cash 
we believe our solution has the potential to enhance significantly the living standards of the unbanked and under banked by reducing transaction costs and providing them with new and additional financial products and services 
merchants and financial service providers 
merchants derive several different benefits from our system 
our system decreases the amount of cash they must hold  improving security and reducing expenses  such as cash deposit fees and cash losses 
by providing financial services through our pos devices  merchants also benefit from new income streams at no additional incremental cost 
in addition  our system provides a record of transactions that is useful for administrative purposes 
for formal financial service providers  the use of smart cards provides opportunities to directly sell products and services to a market that was previously difficult to reach 
for instance  insurance companies can offer their products with the premium deducted directly from the individual s smart card 
in the case of lending  administrative costs are decreased along with the expense of holding cash 
again  the collection of payments can occur directly from the smart card  reducing credit risk and helping to establish credit history 
employers 
our system enables employers to eliminate cash from the wage payment process 
this reduces expenses by avoiding cash handling and management  the need to insure  secure and transport that cash and the bank transaction fees associated with obtaining cash in the first place 
the process of paying employees using cash is also time consuming  taking up to half a day per pay period in some instances 
the use of our system eliminates this process and thereby increases productivity 
in addition  because cash payments are distributed in packets to employees  disputes can arise as to the amount of cash in the packet 
our system also eliminates this problem since the amount reflected on the card holders accounts are recorded on the back end system and then distributed on the smart cards 
finally  employers frequently provide additional services to their employees out of necessity  particularly loans 
our system enables other service providers to deliver these products 
government agencies 
a fundamental policy goal for almost any government is to enhance the welfare of the poorest citizens in the country 
yet the use of cash is a poor method for delivering social welfare grants since it is difficult to track  and the recipients endure a range of expenses and dangers that reduce their options 
by using our system  government agencies enjoy reduced costs in the delivery of benefits to recipients by eliminating the use of cash while increasing the options available to the recipient 
this use of our system intrinsically increases the welfare that government agencies can provide from the same amount of taxes collected 
our system also has the potential to increase the amount of taxes collected by bringing informal businesses into the formal economy 
the presence of a full audit trail also means that government agencies can combat corruption 
moreover  the use of smart cards for the delivery of additional services  including insurance products  means that regulatory bodies can expand their oversight of transactions for individuals who are frequently least able to protect themselves 
in regard to medical benefits  our system provides comprehensive inventory management and has the potential to improve the treatment of patients significantly 
our business strengths we believe our business strengths include technology leadership 
we believe we are the first company to develop  implement and operate an affordable  flexible and secure electronic payment system for the unbanked and under banked that works offline 
of equal importance  our smart cards are secured through biometric fingerprint authentication and have a broad range of additional functionality through the use of wallets that can be turned on as needed or as services become available 
we can deliver these services to the unbanked population at a fraction of the cost of traditional systems 
our ability to implement an hiv aids system on the same smart card as financial services demonstrates the flexibility of our approach 
in addition  we have validated the security of our smart cards along with our overall system  forming the foundation for a trusted solution 
independent third parties have reviewed and published our security protocols and we have refined our system in a way to provide system integrity over the life of the smart cards 
from our inception in to date  we have not suffered any security breaches or losses of transactions or funds on our system 
in addition  our acquisition of prism gave us access to well established core cryptography  software  hardware  embedded chip  wireless and payment expertise 
proven solution 
our system is proven is widely used 
today over million clients in south africa receive monthly welfare or pension payments through our system under contracts with five provinces 
historically  welfare and pension recipients would only download cash from smart cards  but since we began our merchant acquiring initiative in july  these recipients increasingly choose to use their smart cards at merchant locations  which generate additional revenues for us 
during the year ended june   the number of our clients that opted to receive their grants through our retail infrastructure grew to approximately  an increase from approximately  and  during fiscal and  respectively 
for the years ended june  and  the total value of transactions processed through our ueps merchant network was approximately  million and million  respectively 
as of june   we had  pos devices installed at  participating retail merchants compared to june   when we had  pos devices installed at  participating retail merchants versatile application 
once an individual begins using our smart card  we become a logical provider of a broad range of additional products and services 
for instance  a card holder using our system for the administration of medical treatment can also use the same smart card for receiving welfare payments or wages as well as making purchases 
because use of each smart card is secured biometrically  the smart card can also be used for identification and voting 
the additional uses mean that once we have enrolled and delivered a smart card to an individual  our revenue potential increases significantly beyond the initial service for which that individual has signed up 
broad appeal that drives opportunities 
because our system provides economic benefits to all participants  we believe there are strong incentives for government agencies and employers to adopt our system in many developing countries 
our solution is also appealing because a single deployment enables the delivery of a broad array of new services to those who are potentially most in need of them  often at a lower cost than alternative distribution methods 
increasing returns to scale 
the initial establishment of our system in a province or country requires upfront expenditures for computers  distribution infrastructure and card holder registration 
once in place  though  the cost to us of supplying additional products to users is low 
for instance  if a customer receives welfare payments on one of our smart cards and then chooses to purchase insurance through our system  there is almost no additional expense for us to deduct the insurance premium regularly 
as a result  the operating margin for that customer increases significantly  offset only by any marketing or administrative costs associated with that product 
our strategy we intend to provide the leading system for the world s estimated four billion unbanked and under banked people to engage in electronic transactions globally 
to achieve this goal  we intend to pursue the following strategies disciplined approach to new markets 
we carefully evaluate new opportunities in order to deploy our business development resources effectively 
we believe there are significant opportunities for our system in the developing countries of africa  central and south america  the middle east  the asia pacific rim and central and eastern europe  where the unbanked and under banked comprise a majority of the population 
where we believe it makes sense  we will use partnerships or make acquisitions to accelerate our entry into new markets 
for instance  during our and fiscal year  we established  together with local investors  companies to create and implement ueps systems in three african countries  namibia  botswana and nigeria 
in other instances we may implement ueps systems in a particular market 
for instance  during fiscal we implemented a national switch and smart card payment system in ghana and we entered into a contract with an iraqi consortium to provide a customized ueps banking and payment system that we will operate on an outsourced basis 
unlock target markets with a key product 
the first step in establishing our system within a new province or country is to establish a broad base of smart card users around a single application 
one of our preferred routes is to secure contracts to implement payment systems for government programs having large numbers of potential card holders 
we believe another effective route will be the delivery of medical management applications  such as for hiv aids 
however  we are not dependent on government agencies to establish an initial base 
in south africa  employers have examined our system to address their wage payment challenges and we are currently pursuing opportunities to deliver this solution 
similarly  banking institutions implement the ueps banking application and distribute smart cards to their clients to replace ageing legacy systems  including paper or book based systems 
expand our products within the markets we serve 
with the establishment of a strong base of card holders and related infrastructure  we can then move to providing additional products and services 
as part of broadening our card holders options  we will also sell our smart card readers and pos devices to merchants to enable them to enter into transactions 
additionally  we will work to establish relationships with post offices  banks and other financial service providers with the goal of making our system ubiquitous in the markets we serve 
provide products and services ourselves where the profit potential is compelling 
our system can dramatically reduce transaction costs and improve data collection for a broad set of products and services 
we intend to offer those products and services ourselves where the profit potential is significant 
for instance  we engage in lending in south africa 
we are able to offer this service at a lower interest rate than competitors due to our ability to deduct interest and principal directly from a borrower s smart card and our knowledge of that individual s payment history 
establish partnerships or make acquisitions when appropriate 
as part of our disciplined approach to growing our presence globally  we will evaluate and enter into partnerships or outsourcing agreements where we can draw on local knowledge and infrastructure to drive the rapid adoption of our system 
we believe that this will enable us to focus on our core strength in technology as well as product development and delivery 
in some instances  we will make acquisitions where we believe that our approach will enable us to gain customers and realize operational benefits rapidly from the deployment of our more efficient solution 
our technology we developed our technology to enable the affordable delivery of financial products and services to the world s unbanked and under banked people 
our proprietary technology is designed to provide the secure delivery of these products and services in the most under developed or rural environments  even in those that have little or no communications infrastructure 
unlike a traditional credit or debit card where the operation of the account occurs on a centralized computer  each of our smart cards effectively operates as an individual bank account for all types of transactions 
all transactions that take place through our system occur between two smart cards at the point of service  or pos  as all of the relevant information necessary to perform and record transactions reside on the smart cards 
the transfer of money or other information can take place without any communication with a centralized computer since all validation  creation of audit records  encryption  decryption and authorization take place on  or are generated between  the smart cards themselves 
importantly  the cards are protected through the use of biometric fingerprint identification  which is designed to ensure the security of funds and card holder information 
transactions are generally settled by merchants and other commercial participants in the system by sending transaction data to a mainframe computer on a batch basis 
settlements can be performed online or offline 
the mainframe computer provides a central database of transactions  creating a complete audit trail that enables us to replace lost smart cards while preserving the notional account balance  and to identify fraud 
system components our platform consists of three fundamental components our fts patent  our ueps and our security protocol 
fts patent 
the fts patent describes a method by which funds can be transferred from one smart card to another in a secure and offline manner 
the term offline refers to transactions that are effected without the need to contact or communicate with the issuer when the transactions occur  as the smart cards themselves perform the authorizations required 
the fts patent also describes how smart cards can be loaded or re loaded with funds and how these can be redeemed for value in either banking or non banking environments 
ueps 
our ueps is a suite of software programs that make use of the fts methodology to deliver an integrated information  payment  switching and settlement environment that underpins our transaction processing system 
our software principally runs on three devices the smart card  the pos device and the back end system mainframe 
when we sell a complete system to a customer or license our technology  we provide all of the software required to operate the ueps  including the smart card functionality  the pos devices that allow our smart cards to transact with each other in an offline manner and our back end system that primarily stores an audit trail of all transactions effected 
the primary strengths of the ueps are its affordability  security and flexibility 
the system is affordable because the computer chips on the smart cards contain all the software necessary to process ueps transactions  thereby allowing the pos devices required to conduct these transactions to contain far fewer components and less circuitry than traditional pos devices 
there is also a reduced need for processing power and on board memory given that online communication is not necessary 
this eliminates the need for an internal or external modem and its associated hardware  maintenance and call costs 
as a result  the ueps terminals are relatively inexpensive and do not require specialized technical expertise for installation 
the ueps also reduces or eliminates the need for national infrastructures  including electricity  telephone or data transmission 
the ueps is secure because the funds in each smart card are protected from illegal access through biometric fingerprint technology 
in addition  every transaction is verified by the two smart cards involved in the transaction using state of the art cryptographic systems in conjunction with protocols and techniques that we have developed 
finally  our ueps is flexible because transactions are completed offline  eliminating virtually all restrictions where verified transactions can occur 
we released the first version of our ueps in it included software to operate each smart card as well as the main payment system 
later versions of our ueps provided all of the functions necessary to issue and manage a smart card and terminal base as well as those needed to effect settlement between all of the operators and participants 
our ueps is fully traceable and auditable 
it can also provide advanced capabilities including loss tolerance and smart card based interest distribution 
finally  our ueps is scalable and capable of working in small applications including a hospital setting as well as large settings such as country wide implementations 
security protocol 
our security protocol was designed to prevent opportunistic fraud and enforce the correct transaction flow 
the symmetric triple data encryption standard  or des  is used extensively in association with a native random number generator that ensures that all transactions are performed by using a random session key pair 
the des encryption algorithm can be easily modified to use alternative symmetric or asymmetric encryption algorithms such as the rivest  shamir and adleman or elliptic curves 
each message exchanged during a transaction names both transacting parties  includes unique information to guarantee freshness and depends explicitly on all the messages that occur before it 
our ueps platform the following diagram depicts how our ueps platform is constructed 
ueps platform fully functional and integrated payment and settlement system  capable of operating all ueps products and systems

the ueps we sell to clients is a platform with the potential to provide all of the products we develop which  when grouped together  form complete systems serving the specific needs of various business segments 
depending on the requirements of a particular customer  we assist the customer in the setup of its application which is tailored to provide only the products and services initially required  although the ueps can later be updated to provide additional products 
we outsource the manufacturing of the hardware components of our system  including smart cards  pos devices  automated teller machines  or atms  pcs and back end mainframes 
however  we have developed all of our application software modules so that they will run on different hardware platforms which allow us to be hardware independent and to provide our customers with the latest and most economical hardware solutions 
scalability 
our ueps can be implemented in different environments  from small closed systems to national implementations 
in closed system environments  the ueps front end equipment is personal computer based and can therefore be implemented at relatively low cost 
in these instances  we provide the back end system on a transaction fee basis  thus limiting the overall set up cost 
this approach can also be used whenever larger implementations are required but where the customer prefers to focus on marketing and selling its products rather than initially concentrating on operating the back end system 
the cost to entry can thus be greatly reduced as the operations can first become profitable before expending large amounts of capital 
on the other hand  large governmental institutions  financial institutions or medical insurers typically prefer to maintain control over the entire payment system and therefore invest in a full system implementation 
the time to launch these projects tends to be longer due to the time that is required to train the end user to operate the system 
once a ueps is installed on behalf of a customer  we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the scalability of the system as minimal changes are required to be made to the application base for the system to manage significantly greater numbers of users 
we can therefore provide additional smart cards while leveraging the existing cost base in a market 
in addition  we have a dedicated team of technicians and developers and an infrastructure capable of supporting a significant volume of customers and their transactions 
as a result  we expect to benefit from economies of scale that pertain to increases in the number of products and services using the infrastructures we sell and or implement 
ueps smart card functionality we have combined these technologies to create a smart card application that incorporates and controls the functionality that is normally found on banking host systems 
our technology reverses the traditional approach where the card acts as an access mechanism to a host managed account 
instead  the smart card controls the account itself while the host system is relegated to backing up and creating an audit trail for the smart card base 
as a result  our technology provides extensive and flexible functionality through a system that is practical  secure and auditable 
the following list itemizes some of the unique and critical functions provided by our smart card technology 
identification  authentication  non repudiation and affirmation of ueps transactions 
traditional payment systems provide customers with paper receipts that reflect transaction details 
customers normally keep these receipts to reconcile their monthly account statements 
during reconciliation  customers can detect fraudulent transactions and errors by matching account entries against their paper receipts  which may lead to disputes  financial losses and the repudiation of transactions 
fraud committed by people taking advantage of the inherent security weaknesses of traditional payment systems increases the cost of managing transactions effected through these systems 
as a result  financial institutions and other system participants must invest significant resources to minimize the risk associated with fraud and errors 
a fundamental element of the ueps is that all payment and money transfer transactions take place between two ueps smart cards the smart card to be debited and the smart card to be credited 
during the transfer of value between the two smart cards  the transaction is written to a dedicated history file on each of the smart cards 
these history files are subsequently used to ensure settlement either directly or through the activation of the ueps multiple streams audit trail feature 
thus  smart card holders can reconcile their monthly accounts directly from the smart card s transaction history file 
also  each smart card authorizes all debit transactions through the presentation and verification of one of the card holder s biometric fingerprint templates that are stored in the smart card  and each ueps transaction is signed by both smart cards 
taken together  these features of the ueps help prevent the fraudulent creation  duplication or alteration of a transaction  as well as any potential repudiation of a transaction 
as a result  the ueps helps to minimize the costs associated with account management and inquiry resolution and helps ensure that customers do not incur losses from undetected errors  fraud or transaction mismanagement 
continuous debit 
people with limited economic means or un established credit histories may find it difficult to obtain access to public utility services such as telephone  fuel  water or electricity unless they purchase pre paid units for these services 
a prepaid unit of service may be a liter of fuel  a kiloliter of water  ten minutes of electricity or a two minute local phone call  and may need to be used within a specified period of time before it expires 
pre paying for services can deprive purchasers of flexibility to redeploy their funds to meet other financial needs 
the continuous debit feature of the ueps eliminates the need for customers to buy pre paid units by allowing them to use their smart cards to pay for these services as and when they need and use them 
all a customer needs to do is to insert his smart card into the utility equipment and the smart card will debit itself whenever a unit of service is used 
the continuous debit feature provides significant financial flexibility to customers and can be tailored to be used in any pay as you go environment  including internet access 
continuous debit transactions are typically a large number of small transactions that can quickly fill up the space on a smart card s transaction file 
we eliminated this problem by designing the ueps to minimize the file space that these transactions require by enabling subsequent transactions to replace and aggregate with earlier ones  thereby treating multiple transactions as one global transaction 
multiple and restricted wallets 
unbanked people who keep their cash at home risk the loss of their funds from misplacement  theft or disasters such as floods or fires  which can have a devastating impact on their financial lives 
keeping funds at home does not generate any interest income and cannot help demonstrate financial responsibility or provide collateral security for the extension of credit 
finally  keeping funds in cash can make it more difficult for people to segregate their funds for specific purposes  whereas having one or more bank accounts can facilitate budgeting for various categories of expenses 
the multiple wallet feature allows card holders to use their smart cards to help manage their budgets 
up to wallets can be configured and activated per card holder depending on the electrically erasable programmable read only memory  or eeprom  available on the particular smart card 
each of the wallets can be configured to meet the specific requirements of the card holder  and can be used for interest generating savings  pre paid utilities  medication management  credit  debit orders and for many other purposes 
in addition  a wallet can be either protected or unprotected 
protected wallets require the biometric verification of the card holder to effect transactions 
unprotected wallets are normally used for low value transactions such as transportation for which speed of processing is critical 
since the audit trail of all transactions performed by the active wallets is stored on the smart card s history file  card holders can provide third parties with a comprehensive record of their transaction histories  which can help evidence payments  such as insurance premiums and demonstrate a regular income stream from wages or other sources 
this audit trail can provide unbanked people the opportunity to obtain affordable services from formal financial service providers which might otherwise deny or limit services to them 
wallets can also be restricted 
restricted wallets allow transactions to be performed only at specific merchants 
for example  if an employer desire to subsidize an employee s transportation costs  a wallet can be configured that permits the holder to spend the value loaded into that wallet only at specified transportation points 
restricted wallets can also be used by governments to prevent social welfare grant recipients from using payment for particular goods or services 
offline loading 
the use of payment systems that depend on online authorizations is difficult to implement in developing economies and countries that do not have advanced or reliable telecommunication infrastructures 
online systems include magnetic stripe based solutions that are widely used in first world economies and require that all transactions  including retail sales  the dispensing of cash  the loading of value to smart cards and the authorization of credit transactions  be performed only at self service terminals  or ssts  atms or pos devices that operate online 
thus  online systems cannot be used to provide financial or banking services to the millions of people  such as those in developing countries  that live in geographical areas that have little or no infrastructure 
most smart card systems therefore  such as europay  mastercard and visa  or emv  also operate online 
we believe that this reliance on online communication has limited the exploitation of smart card technology  has resulted in high system implementation and operational costs and has not addressed many of the needs of the world s unbanked population 
our offline loading feature has been designed to solve these problems associated with reliance on limited infrastructures and allows value to be distributed through existing infrastructures such as the postal service  fixed line telephones  cellular phones  verbal communication and newspapers 
our solution is a unique ten digit signature code that the ueps back end system generates to enable specific amounts to be loaded to specific smart cards 
when a ten digit signature code is presented at any offline pos device to the smart card for which it was created  the code will  after validation  allow the smart card to credit one or a number of its internal wallets in the appropriate amount 
the offline loading function can be used to transfer funds remotely for payments such as wages  pensions  welfare grants  refunds and third party transfers 
when a number of ten digit signature codes are created for a specific smart card  each ten digit signature code can then only be applied to that smart card once 
ten digit signature codes can be presented to a smart card in a different order from the one in which the codes were created but can be effected only by that particular smart card 
biometric identification 
the magnetic stripe credit and debit card systems available today use a written signature or a personal identification number  or pin  in an effort to verify the customer s identity minimize the repudiation of transactions 
however  pins can be compromised  magnetic stripes can be cloned and if a card is stolen together with its pin number  the card can be used to transact until it is reported stolen or its offline limits are reached 
the pin and card can also be used to gain access to back end account information to defraud further the genuine card holder 
therefore  positive offline card holder verification is critical to ensure that a payment system does not effect fraudulent transactions 
at the same time  the system must ensure that the genuine card holder s transactions are not rejected 
as an alternative form of customer identification  the ueps supports biometrics in the form of fingerprint recognition 
biometric scanners are used to record a customer s fingerprint images 
the fingerprint templates that result are stored in the holder s smart card and used for identification whenever the smart card is used 
before a smart card is issued  the following fingerprint recordation process occurs all ten fingers are captured  with three fingerprint images captured per finger 
the three fingerprint images for each finger are consolidated and filtered to create the best image for that finger 
this results in ten high quality fingerprint images 
the ten fingerprint images are used to generate fingerprint templates 
a fingerprint template is a unique geometric representation of one fingerprint 
the card holder is verified against these templates using the highest fingerprint matching threshold to ensure the best recordation process 
this process assists to eliminate the false rejection of genuine card holders due to initial bad fingerprint template recordation 
the fingerprint templates are signed by an issuing ueps smart card and stored on the card holder s smart card 
when a transaction is performed  the card holder s fingerprints are verified against those stored on the smart card 
the verification process occurs in a secure session between the smart card and the fingerprint scanner 
during the verification phase  a moderate matching threshold is used to compensate for the changes in the card holder s fingerprint conditions 
our biometric identification feature is designed to protect our card holders against fraud  helps eliminate transaction repudiation and reduces the complexity associated with hot card management systems and hot line centers  as well as the cost of the systems that are utilized to deal with stolen and lost cards 
automatic credit 
the distribution of social welfare benefits  unemployment insurance  food parcels or vouchers and medical supplies is personnel intensive 
furthermore  beneficiaries must present themselves regularly at designated distribution locations in order to receive their benefits 
these requirements create a number of operational and logistical problems  which increase the direct or indirect costs for system owners  operators and members  including the costs of transporting beneficiaries and payment personnel to and from distribution points  the time beneficiaries must spend waiting in line at distribution points rather than working or engaging in other activities  the need to provide adequate staff  water  toilets  medical emergency services  shelters and security at distribution points  the need to provide personnel to deal with beneficiary communications and inquiries  and the need to create itineraries and schedules for payment delivery personnel  as well as to establish distribution centers and purchase vehicles to travel to distribution points 
thus  governments incur significant costs in distributing social welfare payments at fixed or movable locations  and banking institutions must spend large sums to provide branches and atms where their customers can obtain cash 
many of these costs cannot be passed onto the client 
we have developed the capacity in the ueps to facilitate the distribution of cash at retail merchants in a manner that eliminates or reduces the need for social welfare beneficiaries and customers to travel to a specific atm location  reduces merchants costs of depositing excess cash and that enables banks to reduce their costs associated with providing  maintaining and servicing brick and mortar infrastructures 
we developed our automatic credit feature to allow our smart card holders to receive regular  fixed amount payments at pos devices that may not have the capability to perform online functions 
the participants in an automatic credit transaction are the automatic credit initiator  the smart card holder and the merchant 
the automatic credit initiator is the issuer which creates an automatic credit instruction for a particular wallet of a specific card holder 
the smart card holder is the beneficiary of the automatic credit instruction which has been approved by the initiator 
the merchant is any retailer which participates in the ueps system and has a pos device for a card holder to activate automatic credit instructions 
card holders go to designated points to register for an automatic credit instruction 
while at the pos device  the credit initiator submits an application for an automatic credit instruction to the back end system 
the application can occur offline or online 
once the back end system has validated the beneficiary s information  it creates an automatic credit instruction signature which is sent back to the pos device and is then recorded on the smart card 
on the day that the card holder is due to receive a payment  the card holder inserts his smart card into any pos device 
in the event that the automatic credit instruction is due and valid  the smart card of the card holder is automatically loaded 
interest on card 
unbanked people transact mainly with cash 
one of the most fundamental disadvantages of cash is that it cannot generate interest income for the holder and that its value depreciates with inflation 
the ueps was designed  in essence  to be an alternative to a formal banking account that allows a smart card holder to earn interest on the value contained in his various wallets 
the ability to earn interest provides an incentive for people to maintain balances on their smart cards rather than convert the full balances to cash or to unload them to a traditional banking account where they would not earn any interest 
there are numerous possible types of interest calculations  including simple  compound  continuous  minimum balance  average balance  daily and monthly interest 
the ueps uses the compound interest methodology  calculated daily on the previous day s closing balance 
in order to calculate interest correctly  the client smart card requires a host date certificate  or hdc 
this date originates from the back end system  and is updated on the merchant smart card when it settles its transactions 
the merchant smart card in turn passes the hdc to the card holder s smart card  which enables the client smart card to calculate the interest for any wallet that bears interest 
the system is designed to ensure that the client smart card only calculates the interest using the latest hdc  and not any date given to it from an unsettled or inactive merchant smart card 
once interest is added to an interest bearing wallet  a notification record is written to the card holder s smart card history file and forwarded to the merchant smart card for settlement 
this record informs the back end system of the interest amount credited 
ueps morphing 
the ueps is proprietary 
it is designed for a specific market that requires specific features and as such is not compliant or compatible with other smart card systems 
if it were compatible with other systems  the usefulness of the ueps would be as limited as these other systems and could not provide a solution for the unbanked populations of the world 
however  we have designed the ueps in such a way so that it can inter operate with other standard payment systems such as emv  one of the more widely used standards in the banking sector 
in the future  smart card holders may wish to use their smart cards in environments that are currently enabled for other smart card based payment systems 
the ueps morphing feature allows our smart cards to transact at emv pos devices as if our smart cards were in fact emv smart cards 
our card holders can thus transact at emv pos devices but the functionality provided at these pos devices is limited to that offered by the emv system 
our smart cards  when required  can morph into the standards supported by the pos devices thus minimizing the cost of deploying another pos infrastructure 
our ueps morphing feature is not merely a collection of multiple applications grouped together into a single smart card 
this feature also enables inter operability between these applications 
the emv standard is mainly an online application that requires offline card authentication  online host authorization and online card issuer authentication 
the emv payment application is invoked by the pos device using the application selection methodology 
the ueps smart card can recognize the type of environment in which it is used through the command structure passed to it from the atm  sst  pos device or any other smart card reader conducting the transaction 
once the smart card has sensed the system in use  it immediately morphs this application and behaves as such for the duration of the transaction 
the morphing feature is not limited to emv  but can also be used with ceps  visa horizon and mondex  among other systems 
it places the ueps card holder in a unique position to possess a single smart card  and use it at any pos device  atm or sst of his choice  without having to have different smart cards for every payment application 
automatic debit 
currently  payees experience various administrative problems and other challenges in collecting payments due to them through the formal banking system for insurance premiums  micro loan payments and governmental statutory deductions for items such as unemployment insurance 
in addition  collectors suffer payment losses as a result of insufficient funds  closed accounts  or charge back transactions  and may incur significant personnel costs for employees to attempt to collect from non payors 
payees may find that their accounts are incorrectly debited  unauthorized debits are made or they pay high fees for debit orders which are not processed 
for unbanked people  their problems are often even greater since their only means of payment is cash 
to pay a premium  they have to present themselves at the office of the financial service provider and pay their premium in cash 
these offices are typically in urban areas and therefore unbanked people have to pay for transportation in order to make their monthly payments 
carrying substantial amounts of cash over long distances involves risks of theft and loss 
we created the automatic debit feature to allow a smart card to reduce the balance in any of its active wallets on a specific date and for a predetermined amount 
this function can take place in an offline environment at any pos device 
the automatic debit feature reduces the risks associated with collection of insurance premiums and other regularly scheduled payments by ensuring that any funds loaded to the smart card are first used to service the automatic debit before being transferred for the card holder s general use 
the participants in an automatic debit transaction are the automatic debit initiator  the merchant and the smart card holder 
the automatic debit initiator is the issuer which will create an automatic debit instruction for a particular wallet of a specific smart card holder 
the merchant is any retailer which is a participant in the system and has a pos device for a card holder to activate automatic debit instructions 
the card holder is the person who must pay the premium or other payment 
card holders register for automatic debit instruction at the offices of the automatic debit initiator 
while at the pos device  they submit an application for an automatic debit instruction to the back end system 
this can occur offline or online 
once the back end system has validated the beneficiary s information  it creates an automatic debit instruction signature which is sent back to the pos device and is then recorded on the smart card 
on the day that the card holder is due to pay a premium or other payment  the card holder inserts his smart card into any pos device 
in the event that the automatic debit instruction is due  the smart card of the card holder is automatically debited 
multiple streams audit trails for offline ueps transactions 
the ueps  as an offline system  must ensure that all transactions effected offline are settled  at some point in time  by the back end system 
settlement is critical to guarantee that no funds can be lost by card holders even when a pos device  its paper audit trail or its merchant smart card is lost  stolen or destroyed 
importantly  smart card transactions  including automatic credits  automatic debits  interest accruals  agent transfers  cash downloads and purchases all have a financial effect on individual smart card balances and must therefore be settled in order to preserve system integrity 
the ueps multiple streams audit trail functionality is designed to ensure that the replacement smart card contains the correct amount of funds when a lost  stolen or defective card is replaced 
the ueps provides the ability to activate multiple streams audit trails through pos device profile downloading 
multiple streams audit trails are distributed through the active smart card base and are completely transparent to all card holders 
multiple streams audit trails can only be implemented on smart cards which have an adequate amount of eeprom memory as the size of the transaction file created on smart cards will at least double 
the multiple streams audit trails functionality is especially useful in environments where either the pos device is offline or may be damaged or destroyed due to the harsh environmental conditions in which it operates or where there is a perceived risk that the pos device may be stolen 
when a client smart card is inserted into any pos device to perform one or more transactions  including a sale  load  unload  automatic credit  automatic debit or interest accrual transaction  the current transaction is written to both the client and the merchant smart cards 
the previous transaction performed by the client smart card at another pos device is also written to the currently transacting merchant smart card transaction file as a piggy back record 
the previous transaction or transaction group written to the merchant smart card from another client is also written to the client smart card of the currently transacting client 
this process ensures that each transaction or transaction group effected on a client smart card is distributed directly to a second merchant smart card and indirectly to a third merchant smart card 
the third transfer occurs by writing the transaction or transaction group to another client smart card which in turn transfers the same to a different merchant smart card 
the number of different audit trails streams can be selected through the pos device or merchant profiles 
upon settlement of the merchant smart card  the transactions which were performed at other merchants will therefore also be settled 
each merchant smart card becomes the carrier for transactions that have occurred at other merchants 
all client smart cards become the multiple streams that facilitate the movement of transaction data among unrelated merchant smart cards 
this process occurs in an offline environment 
in the event of the loss or destruction of any pos device or its associated merchant smart card or paper audit trail  all transactions that have been piggy backed can be recovered through the settlement of other merchant smart cards 
the speed at which these transactions can be recovered will depend on how frequently the client smart cards that are used to piggy back transactions have transacted at other ueps merchants 
the multiple streams audit trails functionality provides complete and independent audit trails that help prevent fraud by single or colluding parties 
transparent and automatic recovery for offline ueps transactions 
the ueps  as an offline system  must ensure that all transactions effected offline complete successfully or that  in the event of a failure  the transaction in progress can be restarted without any loss being incurred by either the client or merchant concerned 
failure of the pos device or the premature removal of either of the smart cards involved during a transaction may lead to the client smart card being debited without the corresponding credit being reflected on the merchant smart card 
although the premature removal of either of the smart cards can be prevented by introducing motorized smart card readers  the cost involved is prohibitive and the solution does not address other possible failures due to pos device hardware problems or power failures  which are common in areas with unreliable power infrastructures 
the ueps is designed to recover failed transactions through its transparent and automatic recovery feature 
this feature is activated during the session key establishment phase that occurs whenever two smart cards transact 
during the session key establishment phase  each smart card generates an eight byte natural random number and triple des encrypts it with its generic ueps key pair 
these two encrypted blocks are then exchanged by the two smart cards  and once decrypted  used by each smart card to generate a random des key pair 
this new key pair is used to exchange further information between the smart cards until the transaction is completed 
during the next phase  each smart card passes to the other its smart card unique serial number and its current transaction counter 
at this stage  the client smart card is now able to determine if the last transaction written to its transaction file was indeed also effected on the merchant smart card 
if not  the client smart card simply unrolls its last transaction thus restoring the correct data image as it was prior to the transaction 
this feature can also be used whenever a pos device is disabled for whatever reason 
in this instance  the two smart cards can simply be inserted into any other working pos device and the two smart cards will automatically re synchronize themselves 
further transaction processing can then resume normally 
as a result of this feature  transactions such as transaction cancellation and reversals can be performed offline in a secure manner 
mechanics of loading  spending and settlement the following describes how card holders can load value onto their smart cards and spend the value they receive 
it also describes how merchants settle transactions with our back end system 
loading 
all card holders that receive social welfare grants or whose employers participate in our system can load their smart cards at any pos device located in merchant stores 
card holders can load their smart cards in several different ways 
if the card holder s electronic value was created through the ten digit signature code  then the card holder has three options 
he can effect an online auto load  in which case the pos device connects in real time to the back end system  which then forwards any available ten digit signature codes present in the account of the card holder 
these codes will be loaded to the smart card automatically 
if the communications network is erratic or unreliable  ten digit signature codes can be downloaded to the pos device of a nearby participating merchant where and when the network is operational 
the card holder can then perform an offline auto load whereby any ten digit signature codes present in the pos device will be loaded to his smart card 
if a network connection is not available  the card holder can key in his ten digit signature code and amount to be loaded 
in all scenarios the smart card will be credited only if the ten digit signature code is decrypted successfully by the smart card 
if the card holder s smart card is initialized with one or a number of automatic credit instructions  the smart card will credit itself as we describe under automatic credit feature 
spending 
once value has been loaded to a smart card  card holders may purchase goods or services  make cash withdrawals  initiate money transfers  request automatic loans  effect third party payments and invoke automatic credits and debit orders  all offline at any participating merchant store 
to perform a transaction  the card holder inserts his smart card into the top smart card reader of the pos device and selects the appropriate function 
biometric fingerprint identification is required for most functions to protect card holders against the unintended or fraudulent usage of their funds 
a printed receipt displays the details of the transaction performed and includes other system audit trail information 
settlement 
as spending on a ueps smart card occurs offline  the settlement of the merchant transactions with the back end system needs to take place within the two day window settlement period provided for in the contract  or as and when the merchant smart card becomes full 
settlement can be performed online or offline 
merchants who have access to a network infrastructure can use the settlement option on their pos devices to connect to the back end system and settle their merchant smart cards online 
during the settlement process  merchants choose whether to have the funds settled deposited to a traditional bank account or transferred to a client smart card 
once the merchant selects the settlement option  the transactions are stripped off the merchant smart card  and the accumulated transaction values  less the transaction fees which the merchant is contractually required to pay to us  are paid to the merchant 
payment occurs either through the country s traditional banking clearing system  by check or is credited to the merchant s client smart card for immediate or future use 
the last option is extremely beneficial for rural merchants who purchase their goods from larger wholesalers 
their funds are  upon settlement  immediately available 
therefore  they can purchase goods using their client smart card and or withdraw cash at other participating merchants 
merchants who do not have access to a network infrastructure can insert their merchant smart card into any pos device that has online connectivity and perform the settlement process 
many merchants can share any pos device 
if a merchant does not have access to a communication network  the merchant can use our milking function with a milking smart card 
this smart card has greater functionality than a regular smart card and therefore requires a large memory chip for storing multiple transactions  hot card files  a freshness certificate  and any other variables  including fees and or interest rates that need to be updated on merchant smart cards which operate in deep rural areas 
the milking smart card is inserted in the bottom smart card reader of a pos device and the merchant inserts the merchant smart cards to be milked into the top smart card reader 
during this settlement process  the transactions are stripped from the transaction history file of the merchant smart card and at the same time  the new hot card file  freshness certificate  fee structure  interest rates and any other parameter that requires modification are updated 
the milking smart card is then physically handed over to the central office in order to update the back end system 
at the time of settlement  all transactions are stripped from the merchant smart card  aggregated and paid into the nominated bank account of the merchant 
merchants can select their client smart card as their nominated account  in which case the amount to be paid is added to the merchant s client smart card 
we have designed and developed a dual functionality smart card called the net combi card for use in rural environments and for very small merchant stores or hawkers 
hawkers are typically small merchants that sell food or merchandise from a stand on the side of road or on a pavement 
this smart card is initialized with both merchant and client functionality 
while trading  the merchant section of the smart card is used for transaction storage which once settled will allow the merchant to use the same smart card to perform purchases or any other financial function

ss pension and welfare ss pension and welfare provides a secure and affordable transacting channel between social welfare grant beneficiaries  governmental agencies and formal businesses 
through this product  we distribute social welfare benefits to the unbanked and under banked populations  and allow the recipients of these benefits to transact with formal businesses 
how it works 
we enroll social welfare grant beneficiaries by issuing them a ueps smart card that digitally stores their biometric fingerprint templates on the smart card  enabling them to access their social welfare grants securely at any time or place 
the smart card  with its pre printed and unique serial number  or usn  is issued to the beneficiary on site 
optical fingerprint sensor technology identifies and verifies beneficiaries 
the fingerprint reader is programmed to create a random cryptographic session between itself and an inserted smart card  thereby limiting the possibility of fraudulent storage and replay of digital templates 
the smart card provides the holder with access to all of the ueps functionality  which includes the ability to have the smart card funded with wage  pension or welfare payments  make retail purchases  enjoy the convenience of pre paid facilities and qualify for a range of affordable financial services  including insurance and short term loans 
the smart card also offers the card holder the ability to make debit order payments to a variety of third parties  including utility companies  schools and retail merchants  with which the holder maintains an account 
the card holder can also use the smart card as a savings account 
depending on a country s specific requirements  holders load their smart card using one of two methods ten digit signature code creation or automatic credit 
we describe both of these methods under our technology ueps smart card functionality offline loading and automatic credit 
when the ten digit signature code method is used  the government agency submits to us a simple payroll file containing the beneficiary s identity number and the value of the grant 
we then process this file and  using the identification number of each beneficiary  create a ten digit signature code 
the ten digit signature code can only be loaded on to the smart card for which it was created 
these ten digit signature codes can be distributed to the memory of pos devices or other compatible devices  including fixed or mobile atm dispensers or remote personal computers  by accessing a communication network such as satellite  x  tcp ip or gprs gsm 
thereafter  the beneficiary can load the smart card offline 
if a gprs gsm communication network is available  the beneficiary can load the smart card online 
the beneficiary simply inserts a smart card into the pos device and is prompted to present his fingerprint 
if the fingerprint matches the one stored on the smart card  the smart card is loaded with the ten digit signature code created for that particular smart card 
the pos device then prints a receipt that outlines the amount of the grant paid to the beneficiary 
the automatic credit feature allows a smart card holder to receive regular  fixed amount payments such as welfare grants or other benefits  food parcels  meal vouchers and or medical supplies at pos devices that operate offline 
automatic credit instructions are recorded on the smart card at the time they are granted by the issuer 
each automatic credit instruction recorded embodies a number of parameters such as the amount and the wallet to be credited  the frequency at which the credit should occur and the commencement and expiration date of the instruction 
when the beneficiary inserts a smart card into a pos device or any other compatible device  the automatic credit feature will be automatically invoked 
during this process  each automatic credit instruction previously recorded on the smart card will be reviewed 
if all related parameters such as timing  commencement and expiration date are all correct the smart card is credited with the funds due 
when this happens  the transaction is recorded immediately on the merchant smart card present in the pos device at the time that the beneficiary s smart card is credited 
since the electronic funds have been created offline  automatic credit transactions must be forwarded to the back end system through a merchant settlement or through our multiple audit trail facility 
we are able to claim the actual funds loaded to beneficiaries smart cards from the government agency at the end of each business day because the back end system is informed of all of the electronic values created 
benefits 
our ss pension and welfare system provides numerous benefits to governments agencies and beneficiaries 
the system offers provincial governments a reliable service at a reasonable price 
for beneficiaries  our smart card offers convenience  security  affordability and flexibility 
they can avoid long waiting lines at payment locations and do not have to get to payment locations on scheduled payment dates to receive cash 
they do not lose money if they lose their smart cards  since a lost smart card is replaceable and the biometric fingerprint identification technology helps prevent fraud 
their personal security risks are reduced since they do not have to safeguard their cash 
beneficiaries have access to affordable financial services  can save and earn interest on their smart cards and can perform money transfers to friends and relatives living in other provinces 
finally  beneficiaries pay no transaction charges to load their smart cards  perform balance inquiries  make purchases or downloads or effect monthly debit orders 
for us  the system allows us to reduce our operating costs by reducing the amount of cash we have to transport 
ss wage payment ss wage payment allows an employer to pay employee wages electronically  either online or offline  by transferring the precise amount of the wage payment directly onto a smart card  thus eliminating the need for the employer to store and handle cash at the workplace 
we originally designed this product for unbanked and under banked workforces and their employers 
however  employers of employees who often have bank accounts have expressed interest in this product as well  which we attribute to its affordability  convenience and security 
how it works 
employees of participating employers receive smart cards which we issue to them 
we download a ten digit signature code for each employee wage payment to a pos device  and the employer takes the pos device to the pay site on payday 
the employee inserts his smart card into the pos device which then searches for any ten digit signature codes created for that particular smart card 
once the pos device locates and decrypts the ten digit signature code  it immediately loads the smart card with the wage payment 
the pos device prints a receipt which acts as a pay stub by including the amount of the wage paid and any deductions made 
the receipt also indicates the balance of the savings wallet  if available 
the process takes up to six seconds from insertion of the smart card to completion of printing 
personal identification through finger print authentication is not necessary to perform a load as the ten digit signature code is uniquely linked to the usn number of the employee s smart card 
benefits 
ss wage payment provides numerous benefits to employers and to employees 
for employers  the system helps to increase productivity in the work environment and reduce administration and labor costs associated with the management  transportation  delivery and general handling of cash 
electronic payment requires less time than manual distribution of cash pay packets  thereby reducing the amount of employee downtime 
employers in rural and semi rural areas no longer need to incur the inconvenience and expense of transporting their employees to urban areas to enable them to receive their wages from atm s nor to have to advance funds whenever these atm s run out of cash 
in addition  the system is configurable for each employer so that the database can be split up into departmental or company sub databases  if required 
further  employers of unbanked and under banked employees are frequently put into a position of having to provide savings  loans  burial insurance and other financial services to their workers 
with ss wage payment  the employee can opt to have a portion of his wage loaded directly to a separate savings wallet on the smart card 
interest is calculated on the current daily balance and paid monthly to the card holder 
the card holder can also qualify for an affordable loan  provided by us or another participating service provider  which is loaded onto his smart card 
the smart card informs the back end system of the monthly loan repayment which is applied against the wage after loading the amount due to the smart card 
finally  instead of the employer having to negotiate the most cost effective burial insurance for his employees  he can take advantage of the insurance we negotiate with selected insurance companies on behalf of many employers 
the issuance of the insurance policy is recorded in the chip of the smart card 
for employees  ss wage payment offers all of the benefits described above under ss pension and welfare 
additional benefits include fees for cash withdrawals that are typically lower than bank charges for the same transaction 
ss cash advance the ss cash advance product will provide an issuer with the facility to offer small monthly cash advances to ueps cardholders at ueps pos terminals installed at participating merchants  bank branches and the offices of micro financiers 
the product allows the cardholder to receive a cash advance  calculated offline by the client s card  taking into account the monthly salary or wage income previously received by the card as well as any current deductions in respect of short or medium term loans 
for example  when the next wage is paid on the card  the full amount of the previously granted cash advance plus associated finance charges will be automatically deducted and remitted to the financier 
the card holder will then be in a position to qualify for a new cash advance as and when required 
how it works 
when a client presents his her client card in the top slot of the pos device and the client selects the cash advance function on the pos device  the pos device will interrogate the client card for a previous cash advance that has not been repaid via debit order instructions 
if a cash advance exists  this transaction will be denied 
the pos device will prompt the client to select one of the cash advance options 
the pos screen will display the cash advance option as well as the cash advance amount calculated 
once a cash advance has been granted and the client has been successfully biometrically verified  the client card will credit itself with the amount of the cash advance 
benefits 
ss cash advance has many benefits for card holders  merchants and financiers 
for card holders  the system provides a cost effective and flexible method to apply for a cash advance at any registered merchant  bank branch or micro financier that participates in the system 
the system gives a card holder convenient access to credit as the credit check is performed by the client card itself in order to grant the cash advance  at an affordable low interest rate charged 
merchants benefit through the creation of a new revenue stream as they will be paid a fee for each cash advance loaded 
finally  the system benefits financiers as it provides a cost effective way of granting affordable cash advances without the cost of labor  stationary  infrastructure and administration 
ss loans to a card the ss loans to a card was designed for financiers to be able to participate in our smartswitch systems and utilize the ueps technology to minimize the cash amount being paid out to their clients in respect of loans 
loans which are being made to cardholders can be loaded electronically on to their smart cards instead of dispensing cash 
how it works 
in order to participate in the system  the financiers will have to be registered onto the smartswitch system 
a legal contract is completed between smartswitch and the financier merchant stating the specific hardware equipment requirements 
arrangements are made between smartswitch and the financier merchant for installation  implementation and training of the product 
in order to perform offline loads to a client card  the first step will be to request the amount of electronic funds required for the day s week s transfers to cards 
the amount required plus a fee levied by smartswitch must be paid into a nominated bank account of smartswitch as stipulated in the merchant contract 
if the fee is not included  the smartswitch system will automatically deduct the fee from the total funds requested 
the merchant financier will advise smartswitch as soon as funds have been transferred into the nominated bank account in the contract 
the value will be credited to the financier merchant s instant bank account  or iba  held on the back end system and linked to the merchant agent card reference number 
using the pos device  the merchant will select the option to perform a funds load transaction for the value required 
the pos will go online to the system host  access the funds available in the merchant iba and load the merchant s agent transfer card accordingly 
when a loan is granted  the client card is inserted into the top reader of the pos device and the amount of the loan is transferred electronically from the merchant agent card to the client card 
a slip is printed verifying the amount of the loan loaded 
the client can then perform a limited cash withdrawal if required and utilize the balance at merchant stores for spending and or cash withdrawals 
a sales transaction for the monthly repayment of the loan can be performed immediately  limiting the risks and costs involved in finding the client for repayment purposes or a third party deduction file will be forwarded to smartswitch 
at the end of each business day  merchants will be required to settle their merchant agent cards to the smartswitch system host for reporting purposes 
benefits 
the benefits of ss loans to a card are multiple 
the system reduces cash held at a lending branch as there is no need to dispense cash to the client in respect of a loan 
the loan value is electronically loaded to the smart card 
the risks associated with fraud and theft is minimized as there is no need to hold large amounts of cash on the premises 
instead of collecting cash  the monthly loan repayment can be performed electronically by performing a sales transaction using the same pos device or third party deduction 
the result is a reduction in overall operating costs as security and insurance costs are reduced 
the system also prevents the granting of fraudulent loans as biometric fingerprint verification is required from both the cardholder and the agent merchant card managing the loan 
finally  the merchant has easy access to a full audit trail of all electronic loans loaded from the merchant card to the cardholder s card and detailed management reports are made available to the merchant on a daily and monthly basis 
ss medical management our ss medical management product applies the ueps technology in a non financial environment to facilitate the management  distribution and control of the anti retroviral  or arv  drugs used to combat hiv aids 
the system is designed to operate in the deepest rural areas where no meaningful infrastructure exists 
it is also designed to form a basis for the implementation of other drug distribution programs 
governments and charitable organizations face many challenges in the distribution and control of arv drugs 
patients who do not strictly adhere to the required drug regimen for the rest of their lives face the risk of drug resistance  which can lead to death 
the toxicity of arv drugs requires effective patient monitoring 
data needs to be collected to evaluate the effectiveness of drugs available for treatment 
how it works 
we issue smart cards to participating hospitals  dispensaries and doctors and to their aids hiv patients 
the smart cards use biometric fingerprint identification technology and act as portable electronic medical record books that allow patients to be serviced anywhere without relying on centralized systems and communications networks 
the smart cards carry all patient related information  including personal details  drug regimens  prescriptions  visitation history  doctor s details  dispensary information and other data 
this data allows us to populate and update databases that track each patient s progress  each doctor s performance  each and every prescription dispensed and each dispensary s drug inventory levels 
the system monitors patient activities  and is designed to ensure the integrity of data  reduce fraud  manage drug inventories and  control drug delivery  ensure patient anonymity and privacy  and distribute payment for goods and services 
each day  all registration information  changes to patient information  and information regarding drug dispensation is encrypted and communicated to our back end system for batch processing 
once validated this information is forwarded directly to a confidential server managed by the government and or funding organizations 
benefits 
ss medical management offers many benefits to government organizations  medical professionals and health care workers  and patients 
for government organizations  the system helps save money by improving the efficiency of arv drug distribution and by reducing the potential for fraud and falsification of data 
for medical professionals and health care workers  the system facilitates the real time but offline registration of patients and the storage of crucial patient information  such as the patient s last visit date  changes in information such as height and weight and the most recent prescription 
for patients  the portability of the electronic medical record allows them to be treated anywhere  without relying on centralized systems and communications networks 
the system  which is provided free of charge to the patient  is designed to ensure patient privacy 
finally  our technology preserves the patient s information  even if the smart card is lost 
ss retail and wholesale our ss retail and wholesale product enables retailers  wholesalers and financial service providers to effect commercial transactions with one another and with unbanked and under banked customers 
many merchants who service the unbanked and under banked operate in underdeveloped areas where traditional financial institutions and their products are unavailable or limited due to the lack of communication infrastructures 
in addition  these merchants do not meet the selection criteria imposed by financial service providers  including banks and credit card companies  either for financial reasons or because they cannot meet or adhere to the rules and regulations these formal institutions demand 
the system permits participants  which include merchants  wholesalers and financial service providers to effect payments for goods and services  and to dispense cash from one smart card to another in a secure offline manner 
the system is designed to eliminate unauthorized use by ensuring that all transactions are biometrically approved by the card holders 
the system guarantees integrity by providing an audit trail for each transaction that is stored on both the customer and merchant smart cards 
how it works 
the participants in this system are merchants whom we enroll and consumers who are smart card holders 
when we enroll a merchant  we issue a smart card to the merchant that contains its profile as well as the store s merchant reference number and install an appropriate pos device that takes into account the type of power and communications infrastructure available at the merchant s location 
the pos device is either battery operated or uses a municipal power supply 
all our pos devices can use gsm gprs  tcp ip  x 
or satellite networks to perform loading and settlement functions 
the smart card is inserted in the bottom smart card reader of the pos device to perform on line transactions with customers 
we sign a contract with each merchant that is tailored to the needs of each merchant  reflecting the number of stores to be serviced and the specific hardware we agree to install 
we provide each merchant with installation  system implementation and training 
we also provide merchants with our marketing material for display at their locations so that their customers know that the merchant offers our services 
the transactions stored on merchant smart cards cannot be overwritten until they have been settled by using our offline milking facility or connecting online to the back end system 
benefits 
ss retail and wholesale provides numerous benefits to merchants and to customers 
a growing smart card base offers merchants a larger number of customers who can shop in their stores 
the system also provides them with the opportunity to realize new income streams from the fees they collect by providing at their locations our broad range of financial services and products  including cash downloads  money transfers  loans and burial insurance 
finally  their security risks and expenses associated with handling cash can be significantly reduced  including banking charges and communications costs 
the benefits of the system for customers are a combination of the ones we describe above under ss pension and welfare and ss wage payment 
ss insurance our ss insurance intermediary product enables unbanked and under banked consumers to obtain affordable and reliable burial insurance policies 
in south africa  cultural reasons make burial insurance important to many people 
our system enables insurance companies to access this customer base 
the insurance industry is subject to various laws and regulations which are designed to protect policyholders and our system ensures compliance with these laws and regulations by utilizing the key features of the ueps technology 
how it works 
in order to participate in the system  card holders and insurance brokers must be enrolled in our system 
the broker enrollment procedure is similar to the procedure we use for merchants 
the insurance broker s merchant smart card is created centrally and loaded with the broker s burial insurance product options 
individual brokers receive smart cards which digitally store their biometric fingerprint templates on the smart card 
after completion of the enrollment process  we issue an insurance merchant smart card to the insurance broker 
we provide the insurance broker with installation  implementation and training 
when an applicant applies for an insurance policy  the insurance broker explains relevant information  including the different policy options  waiting options and the day cooling off period 
the day cooling off period allows the policy holder who has decided to buy a policy issued by another insurance company to change is mind and to keep the original policy instead 
the system informs all parties involved  including the brokers for the previous insurer and the new insurer that the client is in a day cooling off period 
this makes the insurance broker of the previous insurer aware of the client s intention  and allows the insurance broker to contact the client in an effort to keep the client 
when a broker sells a policy to a client  the first check performed by the smart card is to ascertain if the client has already signed up for a similar product  which may be accomplished offline 
if not  the client accepts the new policy by presenting his fingerprint for verification by the smart card 
the broker also presents his fingerprint to prove that he sold the policy and thereby allow him to receive his sales commission 
the system then writes the policy number and details  including the amount of the premium  to the card holder s smart card 
this reduces the risk of future disputes regarding the policy 
when an insured individual dies  the beneficiary presents the identity document  the insured s smart card and death certificate  and the original policy document 
this information is checked against the information stored on the smart card by simply inserting the deceased s smart card into a pos device and printing the data associated with burial policy information 
if valid  the claim is paid out to the beneficiary immediately 
benefits 
our ss insurance intermediary product offers numerous benefits to insurance brokers and policyholders 
for brokers  the system provides improved access to its potential client base  minimizes the risks associated with fraud through biometric fingerprint identification  facilitates legal compliance and provides a secure channel for collection of premiums 
in addition  brokerage commissions can be managed through the system 
the benefits for policyholders are generally the same as for customers as described above under ss retail and wholesale 
in addition  because the system reduces premium collection risk to the insurance company  it provides consumers with access to more affordable insurance products of a higher quality than would otherwise be available

these devices and modules are suited for high speed transaction processing requirements  acceptance of multiple payment tokens  value added services at point of transaction  and adherence to stringent transaction security and payment association standards such as tdes and emv 
sales and marketing we market our products and services primarily through our own sales and service organization which is headed by brenda stewart  our senior vice president  sales and marketing 
we have employees in the sales and marketing division  who operate from our head office in south africa and from our regional offices in south africa  nigeria  malaysia and joint venture offices in namibia  botswana  colombia and vietnam 
our sales and marketing activities are currently focused on the sales of ueps systems into the international market  with specific emphasis on africa and the middle east 
we focus on identifying  defining and activating an entry point in a specific country to commence operations 
competition in addition to competition that we face from the use of cash  checks  credit and debit cards  existing payment systems and the providers of financial services  we have identified a number of other products currently being produced that use smart card technology in connection with a funds transfer system and the companies that promote them 
these include emv  a system that is being promoted by visa international service association  mastercard international and europay international  mondex international limited  a subsidiary of mastercard  and proton world international nv  a subsidiary of stmicroelectronics belgium nv in south africa  and specifically in the payment of social welfare grants  our competitors also include allpay consolidated investment holdings pty ltd  which is responsible for social welfare payments in the free state  gauteng and western cape provinces and a small portion of the eastern cape province  and empilweni payout services  which is responsible for payments in the mpumalanga province 
the incumbent south african retail banks have a joint initiative that has created a common banking product to offer to the significant portion of south africa s population that does not have access to traditional banking services  or the unbanked 
this bank account  generally referred to as the mzansi account  was introduced in october and offers limited transactional capabilities at reduced charges  when compared to the accounts traditionally offered by these banks 
according to the finscope survey  people approximately of the population in south africa claim to have an mzanzi account  although the exact number of accounts is unknown 
the social welfare beneficiaries who are currently paid through our smart card system may elect to use these accounts to receive their grants 
a decision by a substantial number of these beneficiaries to elect to use these accounts rather than our smart card system may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
we also may face competition from companies to which we have licensed rights to our technology  including visa 
moreover  as our product offerings increase and gain market acceptance  banks in south africa and other jurisdictions in which we operate may seek governmental or other regulatory intervention if they view us as infringing on their funds transfer businesses 
research and development our business activities and product offerings depend on our proprietary ueps software 
as a result  we have a large group of software engineers and developers who are constantly revising and improving the core ueps software and its functionality 
we believe that our smart card system is the most advanced system of its kind in the world today 
however  we use a number of hardware platforms that are not proprietary to us and which are continuously being improved 
these platforms include smart cards micro controllers  pos devices  biometric readers and other back end computer hardware 
we continually work to take advantage of these improvements in our attempt to stay at the head of the competitive curve 
a faster micro controller on a smart card may allow us to process transactions faster and with more security 
a larger memory smart card allows us to store more transactions and to load larger software applications 
larger memories also allow our smart cards to be used for more than one application at a time  thus eliminating the cost and the management of multiple smart card systems 
our smart card system is designed to manage tokens of value such as cash  credit  savings  medical history  identification criteria  finger print templates and insurance policies 
security is therefore of prime importance as any breach would result in the loss of our system integrity 
this would be followed by a loss of confidence and credibility that would jeopardize our growth and market penetration 
we therefore continue to advance our security protocols and algorithms to combat the potential attacks that have currently been identified 
these include crypto analysis techniques as well as reverse engineering 
attacks such as the latest differential power analysis  or dpa  must also be circumvented 
we continue our research in new and more secure algorithms  such as the rivest  shamir and adleman  or rsa  as well as new competitive asymmetric algorithms such as elliptic curves 
we develop and implement these techniques ourselves and own the software that we create 
we are also involved in extensive research and development in gsm  cryptography  pos  retail and card not present payment applications 
lastly  we continue to study the needs of our target market and develop new ueps features that satisfy these needs 
as our ueps system is implemented in more and more developing countries  we create greater connectivity between our systems to subsequently activate international transactions and cross border money transfers 
intellectual property our success depends in part on our ability to develop and maintain a competitive intellectual property advantage over potential competitors in the electronic financial services industry 
we believe that we have developed the first payment system based on technology that is protected by our fts patents 
we rely on know how  including trade secrets and other confidential information  continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to further develop our proprietary position 
our ability and the ability of our licensors to obtain intellectual property protection for the ueps technology and related processes  including any improvements to and developments of them  to operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our intellectual property rights will be important factors to our success 
the fts patents  which include aspects of the ueps technology  have been issued in the united states  hong kong  south africa  botswana  namibia and swaziland 
the fts patent in the united states was granted as us patent no 
 on december  the patent was reissued as us patent no 
re  on july   and will expire on may  it currently remains in full force and effect  and we are not aware of any challenges to its enforceability 
the fts patent in hong kong was granted on december   and will expire in the hong kong fts patent is jointly owned by us and the estate of a co inventor 
the fts patents in south africa  botswana  namibia and swaziland were granted on september   march   april  and december   respectively 
the namibia fts patent expired in the south africa  botswana and swaziland patents remain in full force and effect  and we are not aware of any challenges to their enforceability 
the fts patents expire in in south africa  botswana and swaziland 
a european fts patent was filed in october and granted in december the european patent convention provides for an opposition period of nine months following the grant of a european patent  and six parties filed an opposition to the grant of the fts patent 
the case was heard before a board of the opposition division in march and the patent was upheld 
following this decision  a number of the original opponents filed an appeal 
the oral proceedings for the appeal were heard on october  and the appeal board reversed the earlier decision 
the formal written decision from the appeal board was received on december  consequently  the european patent has been revoked and there is no possibility of any further appeal 
however  our business plan and forecast do not account for such royalties as a source of revenue in the medium to long term  as the key to our operations in europe is based on our know how and ability to exploit the technology rather than on the european patent 
accordingly  we do not expect this ruling to have a material adverse effect on us in the future 
aspects of the ueps technology are described in us patent no 
re  this patent  entitled funds transfer system  is directed to a method of transferring funds between financial institutions via a smart card 
in particular  the method includes linking a smart card first device to a first financial institution  debiting an account held at the financial institution and recording a corresponding credit value in the smart card 
the smart card is then linked to a second  similar device  wherein the credit value in the smart card is reduced and a corresponding credit value is recorded in the second device 
the second device is then linked to a second financial institution  wherein the credit value in the second device is reduced and a corresponding credit value is recorded in an account held at the second financial institution 
the smart card and the second device each store at least a portion of a program which is run in a synchronized interactive manner between the devices 
in  we entered into a technology license agreement with visa international service association  or visa 
under that agreement  visa purchased a non exclusive  perpetual  worldwide license to our technology rights that are defined in the agreement to mean all our then current worldwide patent rights  copyrights  mask work rights  trade secrets and other intellectual property rights relating to our ueps technology 
this visa license includes an exclusive  perpetual  worldwide license under our patents  as defined in the agreement  licensed to visa that is exclusive to the financial services industry  as defined in the agreement 
the agreement defines patents as meaning our current worldwide patents and patent rights  including us patent no 
 including without limitation  enhancements  improvements and expansions to all of the licensed patents and any foreign patent applications corresponding to any patent associated with any of our products or services that use technology related to financial services or can be used in the financial services industry 
the agreement defines financial services industry as persons or companies that are directly or indirectly making loans  taking deposits  selling  brokering  or factoring securities  insurance  mortgages or receivables  and providing payment services  such as issuing charge cards  credit cards  payment cards  debit cards or any other system that could compete with such payment methods 
our visa agreement grants back to us the non exclusive right under our visa licensed patents to make  use and sell our payment systems and other products in the financial services industry as defined in the agreement 
in our visa agreement  visa agrees not to grant a sublicense to any payment system to any entities in the financial services industry who are not members of visa already if such entity already has a right to use such payment systems from us 
the agreement permits visa to sublicense our licensed technology rights to any of its member  any entity in the financial services industry or any entity outside of the financial services industry that provides products to visa or its sublicensees 
the agreement prohibits us from licensing our technology rights  not just our licensed patents  to any of visa s competitors  including mastercard  europay  american express company  discover financial services  diners club international credit card co  carte blanche card or jcb international credit card co 
or any of their parents  subsidiaries or affiliates 
we have also licensed our foreign fts patents in south africa  botswana  namibia and swaziland to visa  nedbank and first national bank of south africa 
the patent position of companies like ours is generally uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
our ability to maintain and solidify a proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted 
the fts patents and related patents that may issue in the future  or those licensed to us  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing our product or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our processes 
in addition  the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
because of the extensive time required for development and testing of a potential product  it is possible that  before any of our products can be commercialized  any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization  thereby reducing any advantage of the patent 
we hold trademarks in south africa  botswana  namibia  lesotho  swaziland and france 
we own the exclusive copyrights in the current version of the ueps programs  subject to any copyrights in preexisting materials in earlier versions of the ueps programs that are jointly owned by us and other parties under various agreements 
effective october   we entered into an agreement with metrolink proprietary limited  a nedbank subsidiary  assigning metrolink the then current copyrights in the ueps programs with respect to south africa  namibia  botswana  lesotho  swaziland  mozambique and zimbabwe 
under this agreement with metrolink  we retained the worldwide copyright rights in the ueps programs outside of the seven listed countries  and acquired the worldwide copyright rights in the metrolink system later known as the megalink system for all countries outside of the same seven listed countries 
in july  we confirmed our joint ownership with nedbank of the copyright ownership in the then current ueps programs on a worldwide basis and agreed with nedbank that neither nedbank nor we had any obligation to share with each other any income or other monies either of us derived from the ueps software 
then  on july   we agreed again by written agreement with nedbank that all copyrights in the then current ueps programs as of june would be jointly owned by nedbank and us 
since july  there have been no further agreements respecting copyright ownership in the ueps programs 
we are the sole copyright owner of all original material in the ueps programs developed by us since july financial information about geographical areas and operating segments for the year ended june   we derived substantially all of our revenues from customers located in south africa and the central bank of ghana in ghana and substantially all of our assets were located in south africa 
for each of the years ended and  we derived substantially all of our revenues from customers located in south africa and substantially all of our assets were located in south africa

we believe we have a good relationship with our employees and saccawu and numsa 
corporate history net ueps technologies  inc was incorporated in florida in may until june  net ueps technologies  inc was a development stage company and its business consisted only of acquiring a license to the us fts patent and obtaining an exclusive marketing agreement for the universal electronic payment system  or ueps  technology outside south africa  namibia  botswana and swaziland 
in  net acquired net applied technologies holdings limited  or aplitec  a public company listed on the jse securities exchange south africa 
aplitec owned the fts patent in south africa  namibia  botswana and swaziland and one of its subsidiaries was the other party to the marketing agreement described above 
the primary purpose of the aplitec transaction was to consolidate into one group the intellectual property rights relating to the fts patent and the ueps technology  to establish a first mover advantage in developing economies for the commercialization of the ueps technology  and to exploit market opportunities for growth through strategic alliances and acquisitions 
the transaction permitted aplitec s shareholders to reinvest the sale proceeds in net  but under south african exchange control regulations  shareholders of aplitec were not permitted to hold net s securities directly 
therefore  in order to comply with these regulations  these reinvesting shareholders received  through an interest in a south african trust  securities of a newly formed net subsidiary that acquired aplitec new aplitec  consisting of b class loan accounts and b class preference shares 
the a class loan accounts and a class preference shares of new aplitec are held by net these reinvesting holders also obtained the right to receive  for no additional consideration  shares of our special convertible preferred stock which are held by a cayman islands trust 
we refer to the b class loan accounts  b class preference shares and special convertible preferred stock that we and new aplitec issued in the transaction as the linked units 
the special convertible preferred stock is structured so as to be economically equivalent to common stock and has substantially the same rights as our common stock 
the special convertible preferred stock is convertible on a one for one basis into our common stock upon the occurrence of a trigger event  and holders are entitled to vote on an as converted basis 
upon conversion of the special convertible preferred stock into shares of our common stock upon the occurrence of a trigger event  the linked unit holder cedes to net the b class loan accounts and b class preference shares that were part of the linked unit 
a trigger event includes any of the following giving of a conversion notice by a linked unit holder  the abolition or relaxation of south african exchange control regulations or the liquidation of new aplitec or net we describe the aplitec transaction and our special convertible preferred stock and the new aplitec b class loans and b class preference shares in more detail in notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
during the period from the completion of the aplitec transaction through june   an aggregate of  shares of special convertible preferred stock were converted into an equal number of shares of common stock  and the number of outstanding shares of special convertible preferred stock was correspondingly reduced

risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should consider carefully the following risk factors  as well as the other information in this form k  before deciding to invest in our shares of common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity would suffer 
if this happens  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline and you might lose all or part of your investment in our common stock 
the south african social security agency  or sassa  is in the process of conducting a national tender for the distribution of welfare grants in which bidders had the opportunity to bid for all of south africa or on a province by province basis 
if we were not to receive contracts to continue to distribute these grants in each of the provinces where we currently distribute them  or if we do win these contracts  but the terms are not as favorable to us as our current contracts  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected 
we currently derive a majority of our revenues from contracts to distribute social welfare grants on behalf of five of the nine provincial governments of south africa 
for the foreseeable future  our revenues  results of operations and cash flows will depend on this concentrated group of customers 
during the years ended june   and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues from payments made to us by these provinces under our government social welfare contracts 
the south african social security agency  or sassa  is in the process of conducting a national tender for the distribution of welfare grants in which bidders had the opportunity to bid for all of south africa or on a province by province basis 
on may   we filed proposals for each of south africa s nine provinces  as well as a proposal for the entire country 
sassa provided an indicative time frame for the evaluation of the tender proposals and the award of the contract to successful bidders  but all of the key dates have already been missed 
as part of the evaluation process for the tender  all bidders were requested to demonstrate their proposed payment solution to sassa 
our response to the request for proposal was demonstrated to the sassa evaluation committee on october  in december  we received a notice to bidders from sassa requesting further details of our financial proposals in a standard format provided in the notice to bidders by no later than december  we provided our response to the notice to bidders to sassa on december on january  we received a further notice to bidders from sassa advising bidders that  due to unforeseen circumstances  the tender evaluation process had not been completed and  as a result  sassa was requesting tenderers to extend the validity period of their tender responses from february  to march  we agreed to this extension 
on march   sassa extended our five existing contracts to provide welfare administration and distribution services by months to march  sassa reserves the right to terminate any of the five existing contracts on days written notice  but only after an initial period of six months which ends on september  on march   we received a further notice to bidders from sassa advising bidders that  due to unforeseen circumstances  the tender evaluation process had still not been completed and  as a result  sassa was requesting tenderers to extend the validity period of their tender responses by a further three months to june  we responded to sassa in writing stating that we would extend the validity of our proposal as requested 
on april   sassa announced an update on the progress of the social grants tender process 
it stated that the evaluation committee that has been processing the nine provincial tenders has completed its work  and that at this time  there is being constituted an adjudication committee which will deliberate on the tender and make a final recommendation on the award per province to the accountable authority 
sassa stated that the process is on track and that the outcome will be announced as soon as the process is finalized 
sassa did not provide any additional indication of when there would be further announcements or when the process would be completed 
it also did not indicate how the process it described would adjudicate proposals  as in the case of one of the proposals we submitted that covered the entire country rather than just certain provinces 
on june  we received a further notice to bidders from sassa advising bidders that the tender evaluation process had still not been completed 
bidders were advised that the evaluation committee appointed to evaluate the bid proposals had submitted its recommendations to an adjudication committee for consideration  and that the adjudication committee is currently in the process of reviewing the recommendations of the evaluation committee in order to provide a recommendation to the chief executive officer of sassa on the preferred bidder s for each province 
as a result  sassa requested tenderers to extend the validity period of their tender responses by a further three months to september  we have responded in writing stating that the company is prepared to extend the validity period of its bid proposal to september  but that the company will seek legal guidance from the south african high court to ensure the timely and orderly conclusion of the tender evaluation process 
because of the extensive delays in the tender award process  we cannot predict whether or not contracts will ultimately be awarded on the basis of the current proposals  whether sassa will seek further extensions of proposals or whether a new process might be initiated by sassa 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the tender will result in our receiving contracts to continue to distribute social welfare grants in each of the five south african provinces where we currently distribute them past march   which is when the extension we received by sassa terminates 
even if we do receive new contracts  we cannot predict the terms that such contracts will contain 
any new contract we receive may contain pricing or other terms  such as provisions relating to early termination  that are not as favorable to us as the contracts under which we currently operate 
in addition  according to the new tender specification  any new contract will require the successful bidder to pre fund the social welfare grants in the relevant province for a one month period  which will result in significant cash flow funding requirements for the contractor 
the time and attention required by our management in connection with the tender process and the uncertainty surrounding the tender process has consumed a great deal of our management s time and attention during the past year and until the process is complete  will continue to do so  which may have a disruptive effect on our business 
moreover  because we incur a significant portion of the expenses associated with these contracts during the initial implementation phase  we have historically enjoyed higher profit margins on these contracts after the completion of the implementation period  which averages approximately months 
therefore  to the extent that we are not successful in obtaining new provincial contracts  or if a new contract were to be terminated for any reason during the implementation period  our profit margins would also be adversely affected 
finally  if we were to be awarded one or more contracts by sassa  an unsuccessful tenderor could seek to challenge the award  which could result in the contract being set aside or could require us to expend time and resources in an attempt to defeat any such challenge 
for example  the november award to us of the limpopo provincial contract  which was executed in  was challenged by a disqualified bidder for the contract 
a south african court set aside the contract in  although the limpopo province reinstated the contract in terms of its emergency powers 
nevertheless  the court challenge created uncertainty  consumed management time and attention and required us to incur substantial legal expenses 
we may undertake acquisitions that could increase our costs or liabilities or be disruptive to our business 
acquisitions will be a significant part of our long term growth strategy as we seek to grow our business internationally and to deploy our technologies in new markets outside south africa 
however  we may not be able to locate suitable acquisition candidates at prices that we consider appropriate 
if we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate  we may not be able to successfully negotiate the terms of an acquisition  finance the acquisition or  if the acquisition occurs  integrate the acquired business into our existing business 
these transactions may require debt financing or additional equity financing  resulting in additional leverage or dilution of ownership 
acquisitions of businesses or other material operations and the integration of these acquisitions will require significant attention from our senior management which may divert their attention from our day to day business 
the difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations  integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures 
we also may not be able to maintain key employees or customers of an acquired business or realize cost efficiencies or synergies or other benefits that we anticipated when selecting our acquisition candidates 
in addition  we may need to record write downs from future impairments of intangible assets  which could reduce our future reported earnings 
at times  acquisition candidates may have liabilities or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through due diligence prior to the acquisition 
there are risks relating to operating in south africa that could adversely affect our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
our primary operations are located in south africa and we currently generate substantially all of our revenues from our operations in south africa 
as a result  we are subject to any political  economic  regulatory and other uncertainties in south africa from time to time 
the changing political and social environment 
south africa faces certain social  political and economic challenges  which may adversely affect our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
the country is experiencing high levels of crime and unemployment and there are significant differences in the level of economic and social development among its people  with large parts of the population  particularly in the rural areas  having limited access to education  healthcare  housing and other basic services 
furthermore  south africa faces challenges in building adequate infrastructure 
these problems  together with a shortage of skilled labor  may in the future have an adverse impact on productivity 
furthermore  the general elections scheduled for may result in a change in government s social and economic policies that may adversely affect the sustainability  operation and profitability of our south african businesses 
inflation and interest rates 
from until the end of fiscal the economy of south africa was characterized by relatively low inflation and interest rates 
for instance  as of june  the inflation rate was approximately and the sarb s base lending rate was approximately per annum 
as of june  the inflation rate  as quoted by statistics south africa  was and the sarb s base lending rate had increased to per annum 
the economy of south africa in the past has been  and in the future may be characterized by higher rates of inflation and higher interest rates 
higher rates of inflation could increase our south african based costs and decrease our operating margins 
higher interest rates could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost effective debt financing in south africa 
regulatory uncertainty regarding black economic empowerment 
the south african government  through the broad based black economic empowerment act   or the bbbee act  established a legislative framework for the promotion of black economic empowerment 
the bbbee act allows the minister of trade and industry  or the minister  by notice in the government gazette to issue codes of good practice on black economic empowerment  or bee 
in addition  the minister must publish in the government gazette for general information and promote a transformation charter for a particular sector of the economy  if the minister is satisfied that it is developed by major stakeholders in the relevant sector and advances the objectives of the bbbee act 
on february the minister published the codes of good practice on bee pursuant to section of the bbbee act 
the information and communication technology sector  or ict sector  and the financial services sector are among the sectors that have developed transformation charters 
on february  the minister issued the financial sector charter pursuant to section of the bbbee act 
the ict charter has not yet been published in the government gazette by the minster and  consequently  it does not currently enjoy any formal status 
the ict sector has attempted to ensure as great a degree of compatibility between its transformation charter and the codes of good practice  thereby assuring the probable publication of that charter in the government gazette by the minister of trade and industry 
we are likely to be subject to the ict sector s charter if this document is published in the government gazette as a sector code or a transformation charter 
the ict charter applies  among others  to companies that manufacture equipment for  or provide services relating to  the electronic capturing  transmission and display of data and information 
compliance with the charter is not enforced through civil or criminal sanction  but only through its effect on the ability to secure contracts in the public and private sectors 
one of the components of bee is that a certain percentage of ownership by black south africans of our south african business should be achieved over a period of time 
the codes of good practice will be reviewed by the minister in february which is the end of the tenth year after they commenced 
although bee is not expropriatory in nature  there may be a dilutive effect to current shareholders in the south african business and there may be a cost associated with increasing the level of black south african shareholders  both of which factors may represent a risk 
however  given that non bee compliance may place in jeopardy existing and future south african public and private sector contracts  the loss of which could cause a loss of revenue  the attendant risk associated with bee non compliance is material 
exchange control regulation 
south africa s exchange control regulations restrict the export of capital from south africa  the republic of namibia and the kingdoms of lesotho and swaziland  known collectively as the common monetary area 
these regulations apply to transactions involving south african residents  including both natural persons and legal entities  and are enforced by sarb 
in october  the south african exchange control regulations were liberalized by the abolishment of exchange control limits on new investments outside of south africa by south african companies 
however  according to the circular giving notice of this liberalization  sarb retains an oversight function  the exact nature of which is unclear from the circular 
according to the circular  south african companies investing outside of south africa must now apply to sarb only for monitoring purposes and for the approval of sarb pursuant to existing foreign direct investment criteria  including demonstrated benefit to south africa 
sarb reserves the right to stagger capital outflows relating to very large investments outside of south africa by south african companies  so as to manage any potential impact on the foreign exchange market 
also  these liberalization measures permit south african companies to retain  outside of south africa  dividends received in relation to shares held by them in non south african companies 
south african exchange controls are expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
the south african government  however  has committed itself to gradually relaxing exchange controls  and significant relaxations have occurred in recent years 
nevertheless  under the current exchange control regulations  our management may be limited in its ability to consider strategic options and our shareholders may not be able to realize the premium over the current trading price of our shares 
although net ueps technologies  inc is a us corporation and is not itself subject to these regulations  the ability of new aplitec to raise and deploy capital outside the common monetary area is restricted 
as of june   approximately of our cash and cash equivalents were held by new aplitec and its subsidiaries 
during the year ended june   substantially all of our revenues were generated by new aplitec and its subsidiaries 
in particular  new aplitec will generally not be permitted to export capital from south africa or to hold foreign currency without the approval of sarb 
this restriction may affect new aplitec s ability to pay dividends to net ueps technologies  inc  unless new aplitec can show that any payment of such dividend will not place it in an over borrowed position 
moreover  although the requirement that sarb approve investments by south african companies outside of south africa has been relaxed  this requirement could restrict our future international expansion  to the extent that new aplitec cannot show that such expansion will be self sustainable and beneficial to the south african economy in general 
sarb approval is required for new aplitec to receive loans from and repay loans to non residents of the common monetary area 
in addition  new aplitec may not use income earned in south africa to repay or service foreign debts  including the loan accounts between new aplitec and net ueps technologies  inc  without sarb s approval 
repayment of principal and interest on such loans will usually be approved at the time of the granting of such loans  where the payment is limited to the amount borrowed and a market related rate of interest 
new aplitec will also need sarb approval to raise capital involving a currency other than south african rand  which approval may be provided subject to conditions 
thus  unless we can obtain funding at the net ueps technologies  inc level  these restrictions could prevent us from obtaining adequate funding on acceptable terms for acquisitions and other business opportunities outside south africa 
irregular electricity supply 
since december  south africa has experienced rolling blackouts due to  among others  an increasing demand for electricity 
the number of rolling blackouts significantly reduced during the three months ended july although these blackouts have not affected our pension and welfare delivery performance because our ueps based technology can operate without the need for consistent networking or power infrastructure  they have adversely affected the productivity of certain portions of our south african workforce  including our head office and information technology personnel  and our manufacturing activities 
in addition  even though we believe that we currently have adequate backup power facilities in the form of petrol and diesel generators to support our back end processing activities  the strain on these generators caused by more frequent usage may shorten their lifespan 
although we have ordered additional generators for our head office  demand for backup generators is high and the lead time for delivery of new generators is currently approximately three months 
we believe that the irregular supply of electricity may last for several years unless other short term solutions are found 
there have been a number of press reports discussing the negative impact of the irregular electricity supply on the south african economy 
we could be adversely affected by such a downturn  and although we can not predict precisely how such a downturn would affect us  we currently believe that the most significant adverse impact would be a decreasing volume in our transactions based activities and a significant weakening of the south african rand  our functional currency  against the us dollar  our reporting currency 
trade unions and labor laws 
most of south africa s major industries are unionized  and the majority of employees belong to trade unions 
in the past  trade unions have had a significant impact on the collective bargaining process as well as on social and political reform in south africa in general 
we currently have approximately unionized employees which represents approximately of our workforce 
although in recent years we have not experienced any labor disruptions  such labor disruptions may occur in the future 
in addition  the cost of complying with labor laws may adversely affect our operations 
regional instability 
historically  there has been regional  political  and economic instability in the countries surrounding south africa 
such political or economic instability in neighboring countries could affect the social  political and economic conditions in south africa  for example  as a result of immigration  and this could have a negative impact on our ability to manage our operations in the country 
in particular  the recent political unrest in zimbabwe has resulted in increased immigration into south africa which has been partly blamed for recent xenophobic violence in areas in which these foreigners reside or operate businesses 
hiv aids 
hiv aids and tuberculosis  which is exacerbated in the presence of hiv aids  are major healthcare challenges in south africa and other sub saharan countries 
due to the high prevalence of hiv aids in south africa  we may incur costs relating to the loss of personnel and the related loss of productivity as well as the costs relating to recruiting and training of new personnel 
in addition  the potential for increased mortality rates due to hiv aids deaths to reduce or slow the growth of the south african population could aversely impact our growth 
we are not able to quantify the impact of hiv aids on our growth or costs and cannot assure you that the costs we will incur in connection with this epidemic will not have a material adverse effect on us and our financial condition 
the loss of the services of dr 
belamant or any of our other executive officers would adversely affect our business 
our future financial and operational performance depends  in large part  on the continued contributions of our chief executive officer and chairman  dr 
serge belamant  as well as mr 
herman kotze  our chief financial officer  ms 
brenda stewart  our senior vice president sales and marketing  and mr 
nitin soma  our senior vice president information technology 
many of our key responsibilities are performed by these four individuals  and the loss of the services of any of them could disrupt our development efforts or business relationships and our ability to continue to innovate and to meet customers needs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial performance 
we do not have employment agreements with our executive officers  any of whom may terminate their employment at any time  nor do we maintain any key person life insurance policies 
we face a highly competitive employment market and may not be successful in attracting and retaining a sufficient number of skilled employees  particularly in the technical and sales areas and senior management 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to develop new products that use our ueps technology and to market these products to our target users 
in order to succeed in our product development and marketing efforts  we need to identify  attract  motivate and retain sufficient numbers of qualified technical and sales personnel 
an inability to hire and retain such technical personnel would adversely affect our ability to enhance our existing intellectual property  to introduce new generations of technology and to keep abreast of current developments in technology 
demand for personnel with the range of capabilities and experience we require is high and there is no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining these employees 
the risk exists that our technical skills and sales base may be depleted over time because of natural attrition 
furthermore  social and economic factors in south africa have led  and continue to lead  numerous qualified individuals to leave the country  thus depleting the availability of qualified personnel in south africa 
in addition  our multi country strategy will also require us to hire and retain highly qualified managerial personnel in each of these markets 
if we cannot recruit and retain people with the appropriate capabilities and experience and effectively integrate these people into our business  it could negatively affect our product development and marketing activities 
our strategy of partnering with companies outside south africa may not be successful 
in order for us to expand our operations into foreign markets  it may be necessary for us to establish partnering arrangements with companies outside south africa  such as the ones we have established in namibia  botswana  nigeria  colombia and vietnam 
the success of these endeavors is  however  subject to a number of factors over which we have little or no control  such as finding suitable partners with the appropriate financial  business and technical backing and continued governmental support for planned implementations 
in some countries  finding suitable partners and obtaining the appropriate support from the government involved may take a number of years before we can commence implementation 
some of these partnering arrangements may take the form of joint ventures in which we receive a minority interest 
minority ownership carries with it numerous risks  including dependence on partners to provide knowledge of local market conditions and to facilitate the acquisition of any necessary licenses and permits  as well as the inability to control the joint venture vehicle and to direct its policies and strategies 
such a lack of control could result in the loss of all or part of our investment in such entities 
in addition  our foreign partners may have different business methods and customs which may be unfamiliar to us and with which we disagree 
our joint venture partners may not be able to implement our business model in new areas as efficiently and quickly as we have been able to do in south africa 
furthermore  limitations imposed on new aplitec by south african exchange control regulations  as well as limitations imposed on us by the investment company act of  may limit our ability to establish partnerships or entities in which we do not obtain a controlling interest 
in addition  certain of our licensees  including visa  have become our competitors and this could occur with our joint venture partners in the future 
we may not maintain our current level of profitability or rates of growth 
we believe that our continued profitability and growth will depend in large part on our ability to do the following continue to enroll new smart card users and participating merchants in south africa  achieve growth in the number and value of transactions processed using our smart cards  expand our business internationally by properly identifying new markets and business partners for those markets  identify and execute suitable acquisitions in our target markets  hire and train personnel capable of marketing  installing and integrating our solution  supporting customers and managing operations  continue to expand the range of applications that use our technology and to market these applications successfully  and manage the costs of our business  including the costs associated with maintaining and developing our technology and expanding our operations internationally 
if we are not able to achieve any or all of the above  our profitability and or growth rate will likely decline 
changes in current government regulations relating to social welfare grants could adversely affect our revenues and cash flows 
we derive a substantial portion of our current business from the distribution of social welfare grants onto smart cards in south africa and the transaction fees resulting from use of these smart cards 
because social welfare eligibility and grant amounts are regulated by the government  any changes to or reinterpretations of the government regulations relating to social welfare may result in the non renewal or reduction of grants for certain individuals  or a determination that currently eligible social welfare grant recipients are no longer eligible 
if any of these changes were to occur  the number of smart cards in use could decrease  the amount of money on any particular smart card could decrease or the amount of transactions effected on any particular smart card may decrease  all of which could result in a reduction of our revenues and cash flows 
we may have difficulty managing our growth which could limit our ability to increase sales and cash flow 
we continue to experience significant growth  both in the scope of our operations and size of our organization 
this growth is placing significant demands on our management  as well as on our operational resources 
in order to achieve our business objectives  however  we anticipate that we will need this growth to continue 
continued growth would increase the challenges involved in implementing appropriate operational and financial systems  expanding our sales and marketing infrastructure and capabilities  providing adequate training and supervision to maintain high quality standards  and preserving our culture and values 
additionally  continued growth will place significant additional demands on our management and our financial and operational resources  and will require that we continue to develop and improve our operational  financial and other internal controls 
if we cannot scale and manage our business appropriately  we will not experience our projected growth and our financial results may suffer 
there are risks relating to other countries in which we intend to operate that could adversely affect our future business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
we intend to expand operations into countries and regions  including african countries outside south africa  south america  southeast asia and central and eastern europe  that are subject to significantly differing political  economic and market conditions 
specific country and regional risks that may have a material impact on our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition include political and economic instability  oss due to civil strife  acts of war  guerrilla activities and insurrection  competition from existing market participants that may have a longer history in or greater familiarity with the foreign markets we enter  government interventions and protectionism  potential adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices  including import and export license requirements  tariffs  legal structures and tax laws  cancellation of contractual rights  trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing operations  import and export restrictions  adverse tax consequences  the lack of well developed legal systems which could make it difficult for us to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights  security and safety of employees  restrictions on the right to convert or repatriate currency or export assets  greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles  currency fluctuations  indigenization and empowerment programs  logistical and communications challenges  changes in labor conditions  discrimination against us companies  and exposure to liability under us securities and foreign trade laws  including the foreign corrupt practices act and regulations established by the office of foreign assets control 
many of these countries and regions are in various stages of developing institutions and legal and regulatory systems that are characteristic of democracies 
however  institutions in these countries and regions may not yet be as firmly established as they are in democracies in the developed world 
many of these countries and regions are also in the process of transitioning to a market economy and  as a result  are experiencing changes in their economies and their government policies that can affect our investments in these countries and regions 
moreover  the procedural safeguards of the new legal and regulatory regimes in these countries and regions are still being developed and  therefore  existing laws and regulations may be applied inconsistently 
in some circumstances  it may not be possible to obtain the legal remedies provided under those laws and regulations in a timely manner 
as the political  economic and legal environments remain subject to continuous development  investors in these countries and regions face uncertainty as to the security of their investments 
any unexpected changes in the political or economic conditions in these or neighboring countries or others in the region may have a material adverse effect on the international investments that we have made or may make in the future  which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
volatility in the south african rand to us dollar exchange rate may adversely affect our reported operating results 
the south african rand  or zar  is the primary operating currency for our business operations while our financial results are reported in us dollars 
because our sales are primarily denominated in zar  a decline in the value of the zar against the us dollar may have a significant adverse effect on our reported results of operations 
during the three years ended june   the zar us dollar exchange rate has been volatile 
refer to item currency exchange rate information actual exchange rates table the current exchange rate volatility between the us dollar and the south african rand is caused by a number of factors outside our control  including  but not limited to  the recent credit crisis experienced primarily in the united states and certain european countries and the global socio economic and political climate  including actual or perceived political instability such as is currently being experienced in zimbabwe 
as a result of this volatility our reported results of operations were adversely affected for fiscal as compared to fiscal and fiscal as compared to fiscal these fluctuations may make it more difficult for investors and others to understand how our business has performed without regard to these currency exchange rate changes 
we expect that exchange rate volatility will continue in the foreseeable future 
trends in revenues and profits may experience significant fluctuations as the rate of exchange between the zar and the us dollar fluctuates 
we cannot assure you what effect  if any  changes in the exchange rate of the zar against the us dollar will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
we do not currently engage in any currency hedging transactions intended to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on our results of operations  other than economic hedging relating to our inventory purchases which are settled in us dollars or euros 
we have used forward contracts in order to hedge our economic exposure to the zar us dollar and zar euro exchange rate fluctuations from these foreign currency transactions 
we cannot guarantee that we will enter into hedging transactions in the future or  if we do  that these transactions will successfully protect us against currency fluctuations 
we pre fund the payment of social welfare grants on behalf of our south african government customers and any payment defaults by these customers would adversely affect our operations 
we use our internal cash resources and facilities to fund the payment of social welfare grants under our contracts with the kwazulu natal and eastern cape provincial governments 
we recover these funds from the kwazulu natal provincial government on a seven day cyclical basis and from the eastern cape provincial government on a day cyclical basis 
in addition  through our merchant acquiring system  we may also pre fund social welfare grants in the provinces where we operate 
all of these pre funding obligations expose us to the risk of default by the applicable provincial government 
in addition  the number of social welfare grant beneficiaries in these provinces  as well as the number of beneficiaries receiving payment through our merchant acquiring system  increased significantly during fiscal and  which increased our pre funding requirements 
although no provincial government has ever defaulted on a repayment of funds at the end of the payment cycle  we cannot guarantee that such a default will not occur in the future 
any such default could have a material adverse effect on us  our financial position and results of operations 
we do not have a south african banking license and therefore we provide our wage payment solution through an arrangement with a third party bank  which limits our control over this business and the economic benefit we derive from it 
if this arrangement were to terminate  we would not be able to operate our wage payment business without alternate means of access to a banking license the south african retail banking market is highly regulated  but the south african government has identified the need to service the unbanked market through the liberalization of the regulatory environment in order for retailers and non banking service providers to innovate products and delivery channels for the unbanked market 
however  under current law and regulations  a portion of our south african wage payment business activities in the unbanked market requires us to be registered as a bank in south africa or to have access to an existing banking license 
we are not currently so registered  but we have entered into an agreement with grindrod bank in terms of which our wage payment solution will be implemented by grindrod bank s retail division 
as a result of this arrangement  we do not have complete control over the marketing and implementation of our wage payment system and we have to share the economic benefits with grindrod bank 
if the co operation agreement were to be terminated we would not be able to operate our wage payment business unless we were able to obtain access to a banking license through alternate means 
in addition  the south african financial advisory and intermediary services act   requires persons who give advice regarding the purchase of financial products or who act as intermediaries between financial product suppliers and consumers in south africa to register as financial service providers 
we have applied for a license under this act in order to continue to provide advice and intermediary services in respect of the financial products on which we advise and the payment processing services we provide in south africa on behalf of insurers and other financial product suppliers 
while the license application is pending  we are entitled to continue this part of our business in south africa 
if we fail to obtain this license  we may be stopped from continuing this part of our business in south africa 
we may face competition from the incumbent retail banks in south africa in the unbanked market segment 
the incumbent south african retail banks have created a common banking product  generally referred to as a mzansi account  for unbanked south africans  which offers limited transactional capabilities at reduced charges  when compared to the accounts traditionally offered by these banks 
according to the finscope survey  people approximately of the population in south africa claim to have an mzanzi account  although the exact number of accounts is unknown 
the social welfare beneficiaries who are currently paid through our smart card system may elect to use these accounts to receive their grants 
a decision by a substantial number of these beneficiaries to elect to use these accounts rather than our smart card system may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
we may face increased competition as our sales and product offerings increase 
in addition to competition that we face from the use of cash  checks  credit and debit cards  existing payment systems and the providers of financial services  we have identified a number of other products currently being produced that use smart card technology in connection with a funds transfer system and the companies that promote them 
these include emv  a system that is being promoted by visa  mastercard international and europay international  mondex international limited  a subsidiary of mastercard  and proton world international nv  a subsidiary of stmicroelectronics belgium nv in south africa  and specifically in the payment of social welfare grants  our competitors also include allpay consolidated investment holdings pty ltd  which is responsible for social welfare payments in the free state  gauteng and western cape provinces and a small portion of the eastern cape province  and empilweni payout services  which is responsible for payments in the mpumalanga province 
we also may face competition from companies to which we have licensed our technology  including visa 
moreover  as our product offerings increase and gain market acceptance  banks in south africa and other jurisdictions in which we operate may seek governmental or other regulatory intervention if they view us as infringing on their funds transfer or other businesses 
patent competition may adversely affect our products or processes  and limited patent protection  a lack of proprietary protection and the potential to incur costly litigation could be harmful to our operations 
our products and technology have unique characteristics and structures and  as a result  are subject to patent protection  the extent of which varies from country to country 
during the life of a patent  a product is only subject to competition by non infringing products 
however  aggressive patenting by our competitors and potential patent piracy may threaten protected products and processes and may result in an increased patent infringement risk  especially in emerging economies such as those where we currently operate 
the expiration of a patent may also result in increased competition in the market for the previously patented products and processes 
the patents for our fts will expire  at the latest  in south africa  botswana  swaziland and hong kong in  and in the united states in in addition  our european union fts patent was challenged and revoked 
consequently  we do not have any patent protection in the member countries of the european union 
additionally  we could have difficulty asserting the hong kong patent as it is not registered in our name and it could be difficult to record our ownership of that patent 
as a result of the revocation of our european union fts patent there is a risk that customers may refuse to pay license fees due to us 
moreover  although we have certain patent rights in the united states  these are not expected to have significant utility in our business given that our management does not expect the us market to become a material part of our business in the near future 
each of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
in addition  to date  we have relied not only on patent protections  but also on trade secret  trademark and copyright laws  as well as nondisclosure  licensing and other contractual arrangements to protect the proprietary aspects of our solutions 
other than the patents discussed above  we do not own any other patents that protect important aspects of our current solutions 
we will  however  prepare patent applications where possible for technology related to our smart cards and ueps system when we believe it is appropriate to do so 
these applications and contractual arrangements and our reliance on these laws may not be successful 
litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or protect our trade secrets could result in substantial costs and may not be successful 
any loss of  or inability to protect  intellectual property in our technology could diminish our competitive advantage and also seriously harm our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of south africa  botswana  swaziland  the united states and the european union 
our means of protecting our intellectual property rights in south africa  botswana  swaziland  the united states and the european union or any other country in which we operate  may not be adequate to fully protect our intellectual property rights 
similarly  if third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights  we may be required to incur significant costs and devote substantial resources to the defense of such claims 
we may be required to discontinue using and selling any infringing technology and services  to expend resources to develop non infringing technology or to purchase licenses or pay royalties for other technology 
in addition  if we are unsuccessful in defending any such third party claims  we could suffer costly judgments and injunctions that could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the copyrights and certain related intellectual property rights in earlier versions of our ueps software are jointly owned and potentially subject to non exclusive rights  which may reduce our future revenues 
while we own the exclusive copyrights in the current version of the ueps software  these copyrights are subject to the preexisting copyrights in the earlier versions of our software that are owned jointly by us and nedbank 
as joint owners of the copyrights in these earlier versions of our software that existed prior to july  there is a risk that nedbank could license these works to others and otherwise commercially exploit these earlier works 
under our nedbank agreements  nedbank also acquired the right to request a license of our south african and us fts patents and of all technology and know how relating to the ueps described in those earlier patents from us for entities partly owned by nedbank that are located anywhere within south africa and neighboring countries 
under these licenses  nedbank would pay us a license fee  with us supplying smart cards or being paid a royalty if the cards are obtained from a third party 
if nedbank licenses our works to others or otherwise commercially exploits our technology and know how related to ueps  our future revenues may be reduced 
our current license agreement with visa imposes long term restrictions on our ability to license rights in our technology and could inhibit our ability to realize additional revenue from these rights in our technology 
in  we entered into a technology license agreement with visa 
under that agreement  visa purchased a non exclusive  perpetual  worldwide license to our technology rights  as defined in the agreement  relating to our ueps technology and an exclusive  perpetual  worldwide license under our patents  as defined in the agreement  licensed to visa that is exclusive to the financial services industry  as defined in the agreement 
our visa agreement grants back to us the non exclusive right under our visa licensed patents to make  use and sell our payment systems and other products in the financial services industry as discussed in the agreement 
in our visa agreement  visa agrees not to grant a sublicense to any payment system to any entities in the financial services industry who are not members of visa already if such entity already has a right to use such payment systems from us 
the agreement permits visa to sublicense our licensed technology rights to any of its members  any entity in the financial services industry or any entity outside of the financial services industry that provides products to visa or its sublicensees 
the agreement prohibits us from licensing our technology rights  not just our licensed patents  to any of visa s competitors  including mastercard  europay  american express company  discover financial services  diners club international credit card co  carte blanche card or jcb international credit card co 
or any of their parents  subsidiaries or affiliates 
we may need visa s consent  not to be unreasonably withheld  in order to transfer or assign our rights and obligations under the agreement 
as this agreement does not contain a termination date and contains restrictions on our ability to license our technology rights in the financial services industry and to competitors of visa  we may not be able to realize the full value of our technology rights 
our license agreement with visa substantially impacts our ability to defend and enforce our patents licensed to visa and could substantially inhibit our ability to protect the rights in our technology 
under our license agreement with visa  we are restricted from suing visa  its members and any third party vendors or customers of visa or its members for infringement of our technology rights licensed to visa in connection with their manufacture  use or sale of any product or service offered by visa 
the license also grants visa sole discretion with regard to enforcement of any of the licensed technology rights against third parties in the financial services industry 
under the agreement  visa has the right to control the prosecution and maintenance of the patents and related patent applications we have licensed to visa in all jurisdictions  and we are obligated to cooperate and support any of visa s actions in this regard 
this arrangement could substantially impact our ability to defend these patents  and could make enforcement actions against our competitors more difficult 
we depend upon third party suppliers  making us vulnerable to supply shortages and price fluctuations  which could harm our business 
we obtain our smart cards  pos devices and the other hardware we use in our business from a limited number of suppliers  and do not manufacture this equipment ourselves 
we generally do not have long term agreements with our manufacturers or component suppliers 
if our suppliers become unwilling or unable to provide us with adequate supplies of parts or products when we need them  or if they increase their prices  we may not be able to find alternative sources in a timely manner and could be faced with a critical shortage 
this could harm our ability to implement new systems and cause our revenues to decline 
even if we are able to secure alternative sources in a timely manner  our costs could increase 
a supply interruption or an increase in demand beyond current suppliers capabilities could harm our ability to distribute our equipment and thus  to acquire a new source of customers who use our ueps technology 
any interruption in the supply of the hardware necessary to operate our technology  or our inability to obtain substitute equipment at acceptable prices in a timely manner  could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers  which would have an adverse effect on our business 
escalating pricing pressures from our retail customers may adversely affect our business 
we have experienced pressure from our retail merchant customers seeking to negotiate the fees we charge them 
this pricing pressure could cause us to reduce the level of the fees we charge to these customers  which could adversely impact our revenues and profit margins 
system failures  including breaches in the security of our system  could harm our business 
we may experience system failures from time to time  and any lengthy interruption in the availability of our back end system computer  could harm our revenues and profits  and could subject us to the scrutiny of our government customers 
frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential customers and users to believe that our systems are unreliable  leading them to avoid our technology altogether  and could permanently harm our reputation and brands 
these interruptions would increase the burden on our engineering staff  which  in turn  could delay our introduction of new applications and services 
finally  because our customers may use our products for critical transactions  any system failures could result in damage to our customers businesses 
these customers could seek significant compensation from us for their losses 
even if unsuccessful  this type of claim could be time consuming and costly for us to address 
although our systems have been designed to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences  they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes  floods  fires  power loss  telecommunication failures  terrorist attacks  computer viruses  computer denial of service attacks and similar events 
some of our systems are not fully redundant  and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities 
protection against fraud is of key importance to the purchasers and end users of our solutions 
we incorporate security features  including encryption software  biometric identification and secure hardware  into our solutions to protect against fraud in electronic transactions and to provide for the privacy and integrity of card holder data 
our solutions may be vulnerable to breaches in security due to defects in the security mechanisms  the operating system and applications or the hardware platform 
security vulnerabilities could jeopardize the security of information transmitted using our solutions 
if the security of our solutions is compromised  our reputation and marketplace acceptance of our solutions will be adversely affected  which would cause our business to suffer  and we may become subject to damage claims 
we have not yet experienced any security breaches affecting our business 
despite any precautions we may take  the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems with our system could result in lengthy interruptions in our services 
our current business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures 
we may not be able to exploit technological advances quickly and successfully  which could impair our competitive position and operations 
most of our operations depend on the use of advanced technological methods  which must keep pace with rapid technological changes  new product introductions by competitors  evolving industry and government performance and security standards and changes in customer and end user requirements 
the use of the appropriate advanced technological procedures can affect  among other things  the competitiveness of our products  the safety of transactions performed using our products  the continuity of our operations and the capacity and efficiency of our production 
we believe that new technologies may emerge and that existing technologies may be further developed in the fields in which we operate 
unexpected rapid changes in employed technologies that affect our operations and product range could render the technologies we use obsolete or less competitive in the future 
difficulties in accessing new technologies may impede us from implementing them and competitive pressures may force us to implement these new technologies at a substantial cost 
in addition  limited access to sources of new capital to acquire new technologies may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we cannot predict the effect of technological changes on our business or on our ability to provide competitive products 
our ability to meet the competition will depend on our timely and cost effective implementation of new technological advances 
it will also depend on our success in commercializing these advances in spite of competition we face by patents registered by our competitors 
if we are unable to implement new technologies in a timely or cost efficient basis or penetrate new markets in a timely manner in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements  we could experience a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
we may incur material losses in connection with our distribution of cash to recipients of social welfare grants 
many social welfare recipients use our services to access cash using their smart cards 
we use armored vehicles to deliver large amounts of cash to rural areas across south africa to enable these welfare recipients to receive this cash 
in some cases  we also store the cash that will be delivered by the armored vehicles in depots overnight or over the weekend to facilitate delivery to these rural areas 
we cannot insure against the risk of loss or theft of cash from our delivery vehicles as we have not identified any insurance underwriters willing to accept this risk on reasonable terms 
therefore  we will bear the full cost of any loss or theft in connection with the delivery process  and such loss could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
during fiscal  and  we incurred losses in connection with our cash delivery system of million  million and million  respectively 
we may not recover outstanding amounts owed to our micro finance businesses 
we operate a traditional micro finance business  with approximately branches throughout south africa 
to may   these branches extended short term loans for periods ranging from days to four months at loans bearing interest rates of to per month 
from june   these branches extended short term loans for periods ranging from days to four months at loans bearing interest at a maximum of per month 
in addition  these branches  from june   charge an initiation fee and a monthly service fee 
despite the fact that we attempt to reduce credit risk by employing credit profiling techniques  the rate of default on loans has been high due to the high credit risk of these borrowers and the difficulty of collecting outstanding repayments 
we may therefore not recover some or all of the principal and interest amounts currently owed by our borrowers  which on june   totaled million 
our inability to recover some or all of these amounts may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
easypay is subject to substantial governmental regulation and may be adversely affected by liability under  or any future inability to comply with  existing or future regulations or requirements easypay s business is subject to extensive regulation 
compliance with the requirements under these various regulatory regimes may cause us to incur significant additional costs and failure to comply with such requirements could result in the shutdown of the non complying facility  the imposition of liens  fines and or civil or criminal liability 
we may be subject to privacy laws in south africa and other jurisdictions in which we operate 
our collection  storage and processing  and any disclosure of  customer and employee personal information must comply with south africa s privacy laws  which are at various stages of legislative and judicial development 
however  south african common law and the constitution of the republic of south africa   do recognize an individual s right to privacy  and there are some statutes and other regulations which have been enacted that apply to us and the way we operate our business 
for example  one statute sets out a framework for the electronic collection  processing  storage and disclosure of personal information 
although compliance with this statute is voluntary  a south african court could determine that we would be violating an individual s right to privacy if we do not operate in compliance with this framework 
in addition  south african law requires that we must keep confidential the hiv status of the people that participate in any hiv aids program 
new privacy laws may be enacted in the future which could adversely affect the way we do business  and we could be required to devote substantial management time and resources to comply with these new laws 
in addition  if we violate  or are judged to have violated  the privacy rights of people whose information we collect  store and process  we could become liable for damages  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
as a us company  we are required to comply with certain laws and regulations that affect our international operations and could adversely impact our future growth 
we must comply with the foreign corrupt practices act  or fcpa  which prohibits us companies or their agents and employees from providing anything of value to a foreign official for the purposes of influencing any act or decision of these individuals in their official capacity to help obtain or retain business  direct business to any person or corporate entity or obtain any unfair advantage 
any failure by us to adopt appropriate compliance procedures and ensure that our employees and agents comply with the fcpa and applicable laws and regulations in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial penalties and or restrictions in our ability to conduct business in certain foreign jurisdictions 
our requirement to comply with the fcpa could put us at a competitive disadvantage with companies that are not required to comply with the fcpa or similar legislation enacted in other countries 
in addition  the us department of treasury s office of foreign assets control  or ofac  administers and enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries  entities and individuals based on us foreign policy and national security goals 
as a result  we are restricted from entering into transactions with certain targeted foreign countries  entities and individuals except as permitted by ofac which may reduce our future growth 
we may be required to raise additional financing by issuing new securities with terms or rights superior to those of our shares of common stock  which could adversely affect the market price of our shares of common stock 
we may require additional financing to fund future operations  including expansion in current and new markets  programming development and acquisition  capital costs and the costs of any necessary implementation of technological innovations or alternative technologies 
because of the exposure to market risks associated with economies in emerging markets  we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of our current shareholders will be reduced  and the holders of the new equity securities may have rights superior to those of the holders of shares of common stock  which could adversely affect the market price and voting power of shares of common stock 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities  the holders of these debt securities would similarly have some rights senior to those of the holders of shares of common stock  and the terms of these debt securities could impose restrictions on operations and create a significant interest expense for us 
we may have difficulty raising necessary capital to fund operations as a result of market price volatility for our shares of common stock 
in recent years  the securities markets in the united states have experienced a high level of price and volume volatility  and the market price of securities of many companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have not necessarily been related to the operations  performances  underlying asset values or prospects of such companies 
for these reasons  our shares of common stock can also be expected to be subject to volatility resulting from purely market forces over which we will have no control 
if our business development plans are successful  additional financing may be required to continue to develop and exploit existing and new technologies and to expand into new markets 
the exploitation of our technologies may  therefore  be dependent upon our ability to obtain financing through debt and equity or other means 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of factors outside of our control  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
we expect our revenues and operating results to vary from quarter to quarter 
as a consequence  our operating results in any single quarter may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
factors that may affect our operating results include demand for and acceptance of our new product offerings  delays in the implementation and delivery of our products and services  which may impact the timing of our recognition of revenue  variations in product mix and cost during any period  development of new relationships and maintenance and enhancement of existing relationships with customers and strategic partners  difficulties with component supplies  manufacturing or distribution  deferral of customer contracts in anticipation of product or service enhancements  timing of acquisitions or disposals of major assets or businesses  timing of commencement  implementation or completion of major projects  the relative mix of revenues from established markets  including south africa  and unestablished markets  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  the fixed nature of many of our expenses  and industry and economic conditions  including competitive pressures and inventory obsolescence 
in particular  differences in relative growth rates between our businesses in our established markets for certain products and unestablished markets may have a significant effect on our operating results  particularly our reported operating profit margin  in any individual quarter  with unestablished market sales typically carrying lower margins in the initial phases of our operations in a new area or the introduction of a new product to an area in which we already operate 
certain transactions are difficult to predict and may have a significant effect on our operating results 
sales of this nature include hardware sales to customers and to our smartswitch investments and cause fluctuations in revenue and operating income when they occur 
the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the sale of our products or services to that customer tends to be long and may be subject to delays which may have an impact on our revenues 
the period between our initial contact with a potential customer and the purchase of our products and services is often long and subject to delays associated with the budgeting  approval and competitive evaluation processes that frequently accompany significant capital expenditures 
a lengthy sales cycle may have an impact on the timing of our revenues  which may cause our quarterly operating results to fall below investor expectations 
a customer s decision to purchase our products and services is often discretionary  involves a significant commitment of resources  and is influenced by customer budgetary cycles 
to sell our products and services successfully we generally must educate our potential customers regarding the uses and benefits of our products and services  which can require the expenditure of significant time and resources  however  there can be no assurance that this significant expenditure of time and resources will result in actual sales of our products and services 
we may become subject to a us tax liability for failing to withhold on certain distributions on instruments issued in connection with the aplitec transaction 
there is no statutory  judicial or administrative authority that directly addresses the tax treatment of non us holders that elected to receive units in a trust representing beneficial interests in b class preference shares and b class loan accounts issued by new aplitec pursuant to the reinvestment option in connection with our acquisition of aplitec 
we believe these interests should be treated for united states federal income tax purposes as  and we did treat them as  separate and distinct interests in new aplitec 
as such  we and our affiliates do not presently intend to withhold any amounts for us federal taxes in respect of any distributions paid on such interests 
there is a risk  however  that these interests  together with the special convertible preferred stock  may be treated as representing a single direct equity interest in us for us federal income tax purposes 
in such case  distributions received with respect to the b class preference shares and b class loan accounts could be subject to us federal withholding tax  and we could be liable for failure to withhold such taxes in our capacity as withholding agent 
in addition  our failure to collect and remit us federal withholding tax may also subject us to penalties 
shipments of our electronic payment systems may be delayed by factors outside of our control  which can harm our reputation and our relationships with our customers 
the shipment of payment systems requires us or our manufacturers  distributors or other agents to obtain customs or other government certifications and approvals and  on occasion  to submit to physical inspection of our systems in transit 
failure to satisfy these requirements  and the very process of trying to satisfy them  can lead to lengthy delays in the delivery of our solutions to our direct or indirect customers 
delays and unreliable delivery by us may harm our reputation in the industry and our relationships with our customers 
failure to maintain effective internal controls in accordance with section of the sarbanes oxley act  especially over companies that we may acquire  could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
the sarbanes oxley act of  or sarbanes  particularly section of sarbanes  requires us to evaluate annually the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in our annual report 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with sarbanes 
the requirement to evaluate and report on our internal controls also applies to companies that we may acquire and therefore  this assessment may be complicated by any future acquisitions we may complete 
while we continue to dedicate resources and management time to ensuring that we have effective controls over financial reporting  failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on the market s perception of our business and our stock price 
force majeure events  such as terrorist attacks  other acts of violence or war  political instability and health epidemics may adversely affect us 
terrorist attacks  war and international political instability  along with health epidemics  may disrupt our ability to generate revenues 
these events may negatively affect our ability to maintain sales revenue and to develop new business relationships 
because a substantial and growing part of our revenues is derived from sales and services to customers outside of the united states and we have our electronic payment systems manufactured outside the united states  terrorist attacks  war and international political instability anywhere may decrease international demand for our products and inhibit customer development opportunities abroad  disrupt our supply chain and impair our ability to deliver our electronic payment systems  which could materially adversely affect our net revenues or results of operations 
any of these events may also disrupt global financial markets and precipitate a decline in the price of our common stock

unresolved staff comments none item properties we lease our corporate headquarters facility which consists of  square feet in johannesburg  south africa 
we also lease properties throughout south africa  including a  square foot manufacturing facility in lazer park and depot facilities 
we also lease additional office space in johannesburg  cape town  durban  kuala lumpur  malaysia  lagos  nigeria and a  square foot manufacturing facility in brakpan  south africa 
these leases expire at various dates through the year and  respectively 
we believe we have adequate facilities for our current business operations 
item legal proceedings there are no material pending legal proceedings  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business  to which we are a party or of which any of our property is the subject

a substantially greater number of holders of our common stock are street name or beneficial holders  whose shares are held of record by banks  brokers  and other financial institutions 
dividends we have not paid any dividends on our shares of common stock during our last two fiscal years and presently intend to retain future earnings to finance the expansion of the business 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the future dividend policy will depend on our earnings  capital requirements  expansion plans  financial condition and other relevant factors 
new aplitec s future dividend policy also has to comply with the restrictions placed by sarb as a condition of its approval of the aplitec transaction 
these restrictions will apply until such time as all of our special convertible preferred stock has been converted into common stock 
these restrictions provide that dividends may be declared by the new aplitec board of directors only if i declaration of the dividend is approved by a majority of the holders of new aplitec b class preference shares  ii all loan accounts have been paid by new aplitec and iii the dividend does not exceed of new aplitec s annual earnings 
in addition  under south african law  new aplitec will only be entitled to pay a dividend if it meets the solvency and liquidity tests set out in the south african companies act 
however  the new aplitec board is appointed by net ueps technologies inc  which will ultimately determine whether any dividends are declared by new aplitec  subject to the above conditions 
any dividends declared by new aplitec will be distributed to the holders of a class and b class preference shareholders pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests in new aplitec 
securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans the table below presents the number of securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options  warrants and rights  the weighted average exercise price of outstanding options  warrants and rights and the number of securities remaining available for future issuance approved by security holders and individual compensation arrangements

in july  we initiated the process of obtaining an inward listing of our common stock underlying our special convertible preferred stock on the johannesburg securities exchange limited  or the jse  in south africa 
the listing in south africa will require regulatory approval from sarb  who considers exchange control applications  and the jse 
we have received approval from sarb that our inward listing on the jse would constitute a trigger event which would result in the winding up of the new aplitec participation trust 
as a result of this trigger event all the special convertible preferred stock would be converted into common stock and the b class shares and b class loans attached to the special convertible preferred stock would be ceded to net if the jse listing and therefore the trigger event occurs  we will no longer present special convertible preferred stock or b class preference shares related to the aplitec transaction completed in in our consolidated balance sheet 
currently  unit holders can only dispose of their units by initiating a sale instruction 
we believe the listing on the jse will provide these unit holders with the ability to trade their investment in us on a recognized exchange and allow new south african shareholders to acquire our stock 
the inward listing  if completed  will result in a simplified capital structure 
except for the common shares underlying the special convertible preferred stock  no additional common stock will be issued to unit holders as a result of the listing on the jse 
share buy back program in may  our board of directors approved our share buy back program which authorized us to repurchase up to million of our common stock at any time and from time to time through june  we did not repurchase any of our shares of common stock in the fourth quarter of fiscal the share buy back program expired on its terms on june   and our board of directors has not renewed it
