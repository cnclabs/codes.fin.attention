item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary smithtown bancorp  inc  is a holding company formed in  engaged primarily in commercial banking through its wholly owned bank subsidiary  bank of smithtown 
the bank offers a full array of consumer and commercial deposit and lending products and services through its fifteen branch offices and its online banking site 
the bank also provides insurance and financial products through its two wholly owned subsidiaries  bank of smithtown insurance agents and brokers  inc and bank of smithtown financial services  inc 
for the following discussion  the consolidated entity is referred to as the company and the bank and its subsidiaries are referred to as the bank 
there were several significant factors that affected the company s financial condition and results of operations during the discussion of these factors should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
the growth in assets and net income experienced by the company over the past thirteen years continued into the company s earnings per share for were as compared to for  an increase of 
net income of  was yet another record level of income for the company  an increase of over the level 
various factors contributed to the modest level of earnings growth this year 
net interest margin declined by fourteen basis points during the year as the result of basis points of increased interest income offset by basis points of increased interest expense  indicative of the very strong competitive pressures for deposit acquisition 
new players entering the company s primary markets with a flood of advertisements for irrationally priced deposit accounts placed additional stress on the deposit collection process 
noninterest income for the year decreased slightly due primarily to reduced revenues from the bank s insurance agency 
noninterest expense growth of over ten percent for the year was the additional factor responsible for the lower than normal earnings growth 
the high cost of regulatory compliance for banks over one billion dollars  the costs associated with a core banking software conversion  and the costs of additional branch expansion were a few of the major expenses faced by the company during this combination of high deposit costs and high noninterest related expenses resulted in the modest level of earnings growth for although this growth rate is significantly lower than the rate of growth the company has experienced over the past thirteen years  it was not the result of the credit problems that have disrupted the banking industry this year 
asset quality remains strong as evidenced by the low level of nonperforming loans and net chargeoffs for the year 
assets reached  this year  an increase of over loan balances grew by  or over levels 
once again  this growth level was not as high as has been experienced by the company over the last decade 
gross loan originations during were approximately  but loan satisfactions including payoffs and principal reductions approximated  during the year 
large and frequent paydowns are the result of the type of lending that the company has been engaged in for many years 
construction projects have a beginning and  if successful  have an end resulting in a payoff of the loan balance 
the next step in the process for the builder is securing the more permanent financing  which in the past has not been a large part of the company s loan portfolio  primarily due to the high level of competition for this business from larger banking institutions and other conduits 
loan growth during was higher during the first and the fourth quarters of the year  primarily due to slower closing time frames during the second and third quarters 
the higher growth levels resumed during the fourth quarter  as greater opportunities for loans within new york city became available to the company 
as the subprime problems and losses grew near yearend  more commercial and mortgage banking institutions announced their levels of involvement in the losses 
the inability of many of these large banks and other conduits to underwrite new real estate loans created additional demand for funding from financially sound  smaller banks not exposed to these credit issues 
the result was the addition of million dollars of gross loans closed and funded during the fourth quarter 
the largest increase in loan volume during was again in the real estate sector  now representing of total loans at yearend 
construction loan funding increased during the year by  but showed a deliberate slowdown during the fourth quarter 
the company began originating more permanent type financing in new york city for reasons discussed above during the fourth quarter  with the advantage of not paying off as quickly as construction financing which typically has an average life of nine to twelve months 
loans for commercial and multi family use were the predominant types of permanent financing originated during the fourth quarter 
the  of net loan growth in was funded entirely from internally generated deposits 
no additional borrowings were needed to fund these loans during the year 
at yearend  the company had approved but unfunded loan commitments totaling  this million was a record level of unfunded commitments for the company 
the company s results of operations can be significantly affected by general economic conditions  particularly its ability to increase loan volume through construction and mortgage lending if market interest rates were to substantially rise 
if the construction industry were to slow due to rising interest rates  bank originations could be significantly reduced 
in order to mitigate this risk  the bank increased its volume of longer term  permanent real estate financing 
the highly competitive nature of this business is another significant factor that could potentially affect the company s results of operations 
as a lower rate of interest is often accepted for this type of credit due to strong competitive bidding and the high quality of the loan  the bank s net interest margin could be further reduced 
this factor has been mitigated by the higher volume of permanent financing expected to continue throughout  as evidenced by the record level of commitments at december  during  the bank s net interest margin decreased from to  the result of an increased cost of funds 
during the second quarter of  management made the decision to not aggressively seek new certificate of deposit accounts which were being priced quite irrationally by some of the competition 
when additional funding was required  it would be provided either through the addition of core deposits demand  savings  now and money markets or through lower cost borrowings at the federal home loan bank of new york 
that strategy proved to be very successful during  as deposit levels increased by  or for the year  with core deposits increasing by  or and certificates of deposit decreasing by  during the year  as deposit balances increased and were in excess of funds required to originate new loans  matured borrowings totaling  in the form of five advances from the federal home loan bank were paid down 
another source of funding during was the company s investment portfolio which decreased from  to  by yearend 
the company s investment portfolio is primarily used to provide liquidity and collateral for deposits of state and political subdivisions  and secondarily as a source of interest income 
as such  as interest rates declined during the fourth quarter  the proceeds from called obligations of us government agencies were chanelled into loans 
during the third quarter of  a leasehold mortgage on a property on madison avenue in new york city was placed on nonaccrual status 
in december  the loan was written down to its net realizable value and moved into other real estate 
during the course of  the bank invested funds in renovating the property and received several offers for the purchase of the building 
none of the offers concluded in a sale  but as of december   the property has appreciated in value as a result of the improvements and increased tenancy  and two new offers for purchase are under consideration 
no writedowns of the property are anticipated during the company s ownership of premises and equipment increased by  from yearend to yearend during the year  the bank renovated two existing branch locations  as well as completed the physical movement and renovation of the new offices in the smithtown branch of its trust and investment services division 
continuing to expand its franchise value  construction also began on two new branch locations in huntington and nesconset 
the core banking computer hardware and software conversion that was planned during and early was completed in may the cost of the new jack henry software was a necessary expense in order that the bank be able to provide the level of service to which its customers are accustomed 
the expense has already begun to reap additional benefits for the bank in the form of additional demand deposit accounts for new services provided 
other assets decreased during  primarily a result of the settlement of matured investment securities as of december  goodwill increased by  due to the acquisition of an additional insurance agency by the bank s subsidiary  bank of smithtown insurance agents and brokers  inc 
the acquired agency was small by comparison to bank of smithtown insurance agents and brokers  inc and was acquired to provide a small amount of additional revenues from personal and commercial lines of business  but primarily to provide access to a wider market of insurance carriers 
the expense for the amortization of the acquired intangible assets was a primary reason for the reduced net income of the agency 
the level of company owned life insurance policies remained constant during  but the gain in cash value was at a significantly higher rate of return 
the increased level of earnings on the policies was partially the result of an exchange of general account policies into separate account policies  as well as an exchange to a different insurance carrier 
was a difficult  challenging year for all banking institutions 
market interest rates began at a high level  with an inverted yield curve causing difficulty for the normal business of banking 
as a result of a heightened awareness of the losses that many financial institutions were facing due to the subprime mortgage business  the federal reserve bank lowered market rates which then resulted in additional earnings depression for many asset sensitive banks 
the yield curve has regained a slightly upward slope  but the credit crisis has created losses that the industry has not seen in many years 
the company emerged from a very difficult year with a modest level of earnings growth and asset growth  an roe that still remains one of the highest of its peers  and is well positioned for continued growth in although no one can accurately predict where the volatile markets and ensuing us economy will be at the end of  the management team of the company remains committed to meet whatever challenges may emerge during the new year 
application of critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported asset and liability balances and revenue and expense amounts 
our determination of the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based on our subjective evaluation of a variety of factors at a specific point in time and involves difficult and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that management s estimate needs to be adjusted based on  among other things  additional information that comes to light after the estimate is made or changes in circumstances  such adjustment could result in the need for a significantly different allowance for loan losses and thereby materially impact  either positively or negatively  the bank s results of operations 
the allowance for loan losses is established and maintained through a provision for loan losses based on probable incurred losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio 
management  through its asset quality committee  comprised of several members of executive management as well as the chief collection officer  evaluates the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis 
adjustments are made at this time to a level deemed adequate by the committee  based on its risk evaluation of the portfolio in its entirety as well as in specific loan details 
the allowance is comprised of both individual valuation allowances and loan pool valuation allowances 
the bank monitors its entire loan portfolio on a regular basis  with consideration given to detailed analysis of classified loans  repayment patterns  probable incurred losses  past loss experience  current economic conditions and various types of concentrations of credit 
additions to the allowance are charged to expense and realized losses  net of recoveries  are charged to the allowance 
individual valuation allowances are established in connection with specific loan reviews and the asset classification process  including the procedures for impairment testing under statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  an amendment of sfas statements no 
and  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures  an amendment of sfas statement no 
such valuation  which includes a review of loans for which full collectibility in accordance with contractual terms is not reasonably assured  considers the estimated fair value of the underlying collateral less the costs to sell  if any  or the present value of expected future cash flows  or the loan s observable market value 
any shortfall that exists from this analysis results in a specific allowance for the loan 
pursuant to our policy  loan losses must be charged off in the period the loans  or portions thereof  are deemed uncollectible 
assumptions and judgments by management  in conjunction with outside sources  are used to determine whether full collectibility of a loan is not reasonably assured 
assumptions and judgments also are used to determine the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral or the present value of expected future cash flows or the loan s observable market value 
individual valuation allowances could differ materially as a result of changes in these assumptions and judgments 
individual loan analyses are periodically performed on specific loans considered impaired 
the results of the individual valuation allowances are aggregated and included in the overall allowance for loan losses 
in addition to estimating losses for loans individually deemed to be impaired  management also estimates collective impairment losses for pools of loans that are not specifically reviewed 
statistical information regarding the bank s historical loss experience over a period of time believed to be relevant is weighted very heavily in management s estimate of such losses 
however  future losses could vary significantly from those experienced in the past 
in addition  management also considers a variety of general qualitative factors and then subjectively determines the amount of weight to assign to each in estimating losses 
the factors include  among others  national and local economic conditions  environmental risks  trends in volume and terms of loans  concentrations of credit  changes in lending policies and procedures  and experience  ability  and depth of the bank s lending staff 
because of the nature of the factors and the difficulty in assessing their impact  management s resulting estimate of losses may not accurately reflect actual losses in the portfolio 
although the allowance for loan losses has two separate components  one for impairment losses on individual loans and one for collective impairment losses on pools of loans  the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb realized losses as they occur whether they relate to individual loans or pools of loans 
at december   management believed the allowance for loan losses had been established and maintained at a level adequate to reflect the probable incurred losses in the bank s loan portfolio 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure the sufficiency of funds available to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers and to access unanticipated earnings enhancement opportunities for company growth 
liquidity management addresses the ability to meet deposit withdrawals either on demand or contractual maturity  to repay other borrowings as they mature and to make new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
the company s principal source of liquidity is dividends from the bank 
due to regulatory restrictions  dividends from the bank to the company at december  were limited to  which represented the bank s net income and the net retained earnings from the previous two years 
the dividends received from the bank are used primarily for dividends to the stockholders  and also for interest payments on the subordinated debt 
in the event that the company subsequently expands its current operations  in addition to dividends from the bank  it will need to rely on its own earnings  additional capital raised and other borrowings to meet liquidity needs 
the bank s most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents  securities available for sale and securities held to maturity due within one year 
the levels of these assets are dependent upon the bank s operating  financing  lending and investing activities during any given period 
other sources of liquidity include loan and security principal repayments and maturities  lines of credit with other financial institutions including the federal home loan bank  and growth in core deposits 
while scheduled loan amortization  maturing securities and short term investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan and mortgage backed securities prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank adjusts its liquidity levels as appropriate to meet funding needs such as seasonal deposit outflows  loans  and asset and liability management objectives 
the goal of asset liability management is the combination of maintaining adequate liquidity levels without sacrificing earnings 
the bank s objective in asset liability management is to match the maturity of its assets and liabilities in a way that takes advantage of the current and anticipated rate environment 
asset liability management is a primary function of management and is reviewed on an ongoing basis 
the chief executive officer  all executive vice presidents  the vice president of retail  the comptroller and the vice president for financial reporting serve on the asset liability management committee 
historically  the bank has relied on its deposit base as its principal source of funding 
however  in recent years  various sources of funding have become available to the bank in increasing magnitudes 
these additional sources may be more attractive to the bank at different times based on market interest rates and other competitive factors 
management views all sources of funding as acceptable and makes decisions as to which sources are more advantageous at the time of need 
the discriminate use of different sources of funding at different points in time has contributed to higher interest margins and overall net income for the bank during and at december  the bank had the ability to borrow on aggregate  unsecured lines of credit of  with unaffiliated correspondent banks 
none of this credit was outstanding at yearend  and therefore all  was available for use 
the bank has the ability  as a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb system  to borrow against unencumbered residential and commercial mortgages owned by the bank 
at december    of these funds was available yet for borrowing 
the following table represents management s expectations regarding the estimated cash flow of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  this table has been derived based on internal data and management s assumptions  and not necessarily the contractual terms for repayment or redemption 
the amounts shown below could also be significantly affected by external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions  changes in market interest rates that are not matched by the company  early withdrawals of deposits and competition 
therefore  this information does not reflect the effect of repricing rights or the impact of repricing on interest income or expense 
the following significant assumptions were used in developing the following tables a time deposits reflect contractual maturities  b money market accounts are rate sensitive and accordingly  all accounts have been included as withdrawable within the first two years and c savings and now accounts are not as rate sensitive to withdrawal as money market accounts  therefore a significant percentage of these accounts are reflected in the more than to years category 
these assumptions are based on management s historical analysis of market interest rates and levels of the company s deposits over the past ten years

analysis of net interest income vs 
net interest income  the primary contributor to earnings  represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends upon the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on them 
during the bank s net interest margin decreased by fourteen basis points  resulting primarily from the increased cost of money market  savings and now accounts 
the cost for these accounts increased by  and  respectively 
as the rates paid on certificates of deposit was reduced during the year  customers transferred balances into money market and savings accounts  which were paying higher rates and also provided them with liquidity 
although these types of accounts are more rate sensitive products  the bank has the ability to reprice them immediately  which is beneficial in a declining rate environment 
the cost for the bank s borrowings increased marginally during although  of fhlb advances were paid off during the year  the lower cost advances matured prior to the higher priced borrowings  causing the overall average cost to rise slightly 
no new advances were taken during the interest paid on the company s subordinated debt declined by from december  to yearend on the asset side of the balance sheet  loan yield increased from for the year ended to for the year ended the largest increases in yield were within the commercial and residential mortgage portfolios  which acccounted for  or of the total growth in the loan portfolio for the yield on federal funds sold also increased during from to 
the average balance of these funds during was almost double that of  due to the timing differences between deposit collection and loan closings 
the yield on investment securities also rose during to from during  although the average balance of these securities declined by 
most of the proceeds from matured or called investment maturities were used to fund the loan growth of the yield on interest earning assets rose by basis points during as compared to the basis point increase in the overall cost of interest bearing liabilities 
both sides of the bank s balance sheet contain repriceable balances  which help mitigate interest rate volatility 
approximately of the bank s loan portfolio is immediately repriceable and tied to the wall street journal prime rate 
an additional of the loan portfolio is adjustable and tied to various us treasury note rates 
approximately of total interest bearing deposits are also immediately repriceable

rate volume analysis net interest income can be analyzed in terms of the impact of changes in rates and volumes

information is provided in each category with respect to changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  changes attributable to changes in rate changes in rates multiplied by prior volume  and the net changes 
for purposes of this table  changes  which are not due solely to volume or rate changes  have been allocated to these categories based on the respective percentage changes in average volume and rate

for vs 
net interest income on a tax equivalent basis  increased by  or  from to this increase was due to the combination of an increased volume of interest earning assets of  and a decreased rate variance of seventeen basis points 
variances in volume during  the average volume of federal funds sold increased by 
this increase was a result of timing differences related to deposit collection and loan closings 
by december   the balance in federal funds sold actually declined to from its balance at december  investment securities declined in average balance by  as a result of matured and called securities which were not replaced 
during the year   of par value in securities were called or matured 
of this  in par value   were obligations of us government agencies   were obligations of state and political subdivisions and were other securities 
also during the year  the bank purchased  in par value of additional securities  of which  were us government agency securities and  were other securities 
the bank also sold  in par value over the twelve month period in  resulting in a net gain of these securities were sold during a time when the volume of loan closings were high and borrowings would have been more costly 
the average volume of loans increased by  or during gross new originations for the year totaled  and gross satisfactions including payoffs and principal reductions totaled  of the total new originations  were variable rate products 
the largest area of growth in loans was in commercial mortgages  which grew in average balance by  during the year 
the second and third largest areas of growth were in the construction and land portfolios and the residential mortgage portfolios 
these two segments of the total portfolio grew in average balance by  and  respectively 
these statistics validate the company s goals as well as the changing market conditions of  which point toward originating more permanent type loans than construction loans due to their longer term and lower risk 
the company s deposits grew in average balance by  or  almost perfectly matched to the growth in average loan balances 
the largest growth in deposit average balances was in the money market segment of the portfolio 
these average balances increased by  during the company s elite money market product was very competitive in rate throughout and hence attracted a high volume of new accounts 
the next two largest segments of growth in average balances were in certificates of deposit and savings accounts 
these two segments grew by  and  respectively 
although time deposits grew in average balance during the year  they were not a prime focus of deposit collection 
the company s premium savings account  however  which pays a very competitive rate of interest for balances over  was a high focus account 
the trend for deposit collection was certainly away from non rate sensitive deposit products into more rate sensitive products  for which the bank has a higher degree of control 
the average balance of borrowings for the company during was reduced by  fhlb advance levels actually decreased from  to  during the year 
the average level of the company s subordinated debt increased minimally by  the actual balance of this debt remained unchanged from december  to december  variances in rate the average rate on interest earning assets increased by basis points from yearend to yearend that increase was primarily a result of the increase in yield on the company s loan balances  which totaled fourteen basis points 
the yield on the company s investment portfolio and federal funds sold also increased significantly by basis points and basis points  respectively  but the overall contribution to total average yield was significantly less due to the size of the securities and federal funds sold portfolios 
the average cost of the company s total interest bearing liabilities increased by basis points from december  to december  the major contributor to this increased cost was the increase in average rate paid on money market accounts  which grew by basis points or 
the increased cost for savings balances was basis points during the year  but the effect of this increase was smaller due to the lower percentage of volume in these balances 
the average cost of time deposits grew by only basis points during  another validation of the company s decision to not pay up for these balances 
the net increase in cost of the company s borrowings and subordinated debt were a minimal basis points 
there were no increases in volume in either of these liabilities from december  to december   as internally generated deposits were able to totally fund the increase in loan balances 
the result of the above changes in average rate and volume resulted in a reduced net interest margin of fourteen basis points for the year 
net interest margin remains the company s primary source of net income 
for vs 
net interest income  on a tax equivalent basis  increased by  or  from to as can be seen from the above table  this was due to a combination of an increased volume variance of  and a decreased rate variance of variances in volume during  the average volume of investment securities increased by  although yearend balances were lower in than this was due to a majority of maturities and calls occurring during the last six months of the year 
most investment maturities were channeled into new loan originations to take advantage of higher yields 
of the  in new investment purchases   were in us government agency obligations  with the remainder in municipal obligations and other equity securities 
the largest growth in average balance during was in the loan portfolio 
this increase amounted to  of which real estate loans increased by the highest percentage 
within the real estate portfolio  the greatest increase in average balances was in land and construction loans  which increased in average volume by over million or 
the next largest area of growth was in residential and commercial mortgages  which grew in average volume by 
federal funds balances declined from to as most deposit inflows were either deployed into new loans or new investment securities 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  during  average interest bearing deposit volumes increased by almost the same amount as loan balances  and this increase totaled  the greatest percentage increase within the deposit portfolio was in time deposits which grew in average balance by  or 
the company ran several time deposit promotions during the year in an effort to collect the deposits required to fund new loan originations 
the promotions were very successful in attracting new deposits which were less costly to the bank than comparable term federal home loan bank advances 
the elite money market product was also quite successful in adding new balances to the bank s deposit portfolio  and this addition amounted to  in average balances equating to a increase 
the company s newest branch offices made large strides toward increasing overall deposit balances during  with approximately of all new money attributable to these newest locations 
the average balance of the company s subordinated debt increased during the year from  to  as a result of a  trust preferred issuance in march the funds obtained from this issuance were quickly deployed into new loan fundings 
demand deposits increased in average balance by  the growth in average balance for stockholders equity during was  or resulting primarily from the  of net income 
this strong net income level in combination with the growth in stockholders equity resulted in a return on average equity of 
variances in rate the average rate earned during on interest earning assets increased by basis points from in to in loans were primarily responsible for this increase 
the average rate received on loans in was as compared to in this is a result of the large volume of immediately repriceable loans within the bank s portfolio 
as market rates change  so do the rates on these loans 
the investment portfolio increased in average rate by basis points year over year  due to the purchase of slightly higher yielding securities 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  the cost of deposits increased substantially  by  as market rates increased and competitive pressures heightened throughout the year 
although the company manages rates paid on its deposits carefully  customers have become more sophisticated rate shoppers 
the use of the internet for obtaining competitive rates is widely used 
a customer s choice of where to place available funds has grown substantially  and has resulted in an increasingly competitive rate environment  with higher rate offerings now affecting all financial institutions 
this trend is likely to continue 
resulting net interest margin for was fifteen basis points lower than in  but still remains the bank s primary source of net income 
loans the bank s loan portfolio consists primarily of real estate loans secured by residential and commercial properties located within the bank s market area as well as within the five boroughs of new york city 
loan growth remained strong during the portfolio grew by  over the level  representing an increase of 
the largest increase in balances during was in construction loans  although the largest increase in average balances was in commercial mortgages 
construction loans are typically of a short term nature  and provide the interim financing needs of builders during the construction stages of their project 
commercial mortgages actually grew in balances by  residential mortgages grew by  this year 
these loans consist of loans to customers for residential home purchases  both first and second liens  revolving  open end loans secured by one to four family residential properties and extended under lines of credit  as well as loans secured by multifamily residential properties 
within the residential loan portfolio  the increases were highest in the multifamily segment  which increased in balances by  during real estate lending continues to be the bank s primary focus and strength for and will be for the coming year 
this can be seen from the segmentation of the portfolio which remained stable from to  with real estate loans comprising and  respectively 
the bank s experience as to strong performance  low delinquencies  and minimal charge offs provide the basis for continuation in real estate lending 
concentration risk is mitigated by geographical and industry diversification  as well as sound  conservative underwriting standards and periodic internal loan stratification review as well as credit review performed by a former regulatory examiner

analysis of the allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses at december  and was  and  the change in the allowance account is comprised of net charge offs of and a provision for loan losses of  based on specific reserves for internally classified loans and multiple factors including historical experience and current economic conditions  management feels the level of the allowance for loan losses provides adequate coverage 
at december   the bank s reserve ratio the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of end of period loans was 
at december  this same ratio stood at 
management believes this level of reserves was adequate due to the quality of the portfolio and was within the range of peer group banks 
the allowance for loan losses is an amount that management currently believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred losses inherent in the bank s loan portfolio 
in determining the allowance for loan losses  there is not an exact amount but rather a range for what constitutes an appropriate allowance 
as more fully discussed in the application of critical accounting policies section of this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the process for estimating credit losses and determining the allowance for loan losses as of any balance sheet date is subjective in nature and requires material estimates 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates

the bank had the ability to borrow on unsecured lines of credit up to  at december  unused lines at yearend totaled  impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary effect of inflation on the operations of the company is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the company  including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and federal agencies  particularly the federal reserve board 
recent accounting pronouncements for a discussion regarding the impact of new accounting standards  refer to note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
noninterest income  noninterest expense and income taxes for vs 
total noninterest income remained relatively flat during  with just a slight reduction in fee income of the largest growth in noninterest income was in the gain in cash value of company owned life insurance 
this life insurance was purchased to provide the primary income source for the expense related to various benefit plans provided by the bank  such as group term life insurance  director and executive incentive retirement plans and a supplemental executive retirement agreement for the chief executive officer 
a partial exchange from general to separate account policies resulted in greater rates of return as well as lower risk based capital requirements 
the overall return on the policies  on a tax equivalent basis  rose by over basis points 
another component of noninterest income is fees from the bank s debit cards 
these fees increased by from the year ending december  to december  the volume of debit card usage has grown to a level that almost exceeds the volume of checks written 
income from the bank s trust and investment services division remained relatively flat from yearend to yearend this division represents income from the bank s subsidiary  bank of smithtown financial services inc as well as from its trust department 
last year s settlement of several large estates and trusts increased income for  but was not duplicated during these types of fees represent one time commissions and are not recognized until the accounts are closed or in the case of an estate  the estate is settled 
total assets under trust management actually decreased by  during as these assets were distributed 
fees from bank of smithtown financial services inc increased by or during  as a result of increased commission income 
another component of noninterest income is service charges on deposit accounts  which increased by or over this additional income generation was the result of an improved collection process resulting from the conversion to the jack henry core banking software and primarily represents additional overdraft fee income 
revenues from the bank s insurance subsidiary  bank of smithtown insurance agents and brokers  inc  declined by or as a result of a softened insurance market 
as premiums were reduced during  the resulting commission income to the agency also declined 
during  the agency purchased the assets of payne and palmieri  inc  a smaller insurance agency located in east setauket  primarily to add to the number of insurance carriers with whom they place their business 
it is expected that additional revenues from personal and commercial lines will also be generated as the agency retains and expands the customer base of payne and palmieri  inc 
net gains on the sale of investment securities declined during  as the interest rate environment for the majority of the year did not return large gains 
the sale of investment securities is transacted in order to replace lower yielding securities with higher yielding loans 
it remains the intent of management to hold most securities to maturity 
total noninterest expense increased by during once again the commonality of all expense growth was due to the company s growth in both geographical and asset size 
salaries and benefit cost increased by  or 
the cost for the company s medical insurance increased by for the year ended  a direct result of an increase in premium rates 
a percentage of this increase was absorbed by the employees  but was retained by the bank 
the expense for providing pension benefits to the employees increased by over the board of directors approved an increase in the bank s contribution for the employee stock ownership esop plan for the year 
based on the performance of the company s stock over the past years  participation in the esop has become one of the most valuable benefits provided to the employees 
additional increased benefit costs during were the expenses related to the director and executive incentive retirement plans and the supplemental executive retirement agreement 
occupancy expenses rose by  primarily a result of increased office rental expenses  directly attributable to the company s larger geographical footprint 
these expenses will continue to increase during and as several additional locations are opened 
depreciation of leasehold improvements also increased by during the year  again a result of the construction of additional branch locations as well as the renovation of two existing branches and the move of the bank s trust department to its current location in the smithtown branch building 
furniture and equipment expense increased by as a result of the same factors discussed above as well as the conversion of the company s core banking software system 
the former computer software system used to run a majority of the bank s processes no longer provided the full range of products  services and  more importantly  efficiencies required by the company 
a core banking team was formed to study various software providers and their products  and after careful cost benefit analyses work was completed  the team presented their recommendation to senior management 
the jack henry software was chosen and the conversion was completed during the memorial day weekend 
although the cost for the software was high  there have already been many recorded savings and efficiencies resulting from the new product 
the bank has also increased its level of demand deposits as a direct result of an additional service now offered which was not available prior to the conversion 
the reduced amortization expense for intangible assets resulted from the accounting method used to record the expense 
the highest percentage of this expense is recorded during the first years of the acquisition 
as the company purchased the seigerman mulvey insurance agency over three years ago  the expense for the amortization of the intangible assets acquired is in its final  lower expense years now 
other expenses increased by 
as there are many components of other expenses  this discussion will focus on its major categories 
business development expense declined during primarily due to a reduced level of advertising and marketing 
this reduced expense was partially due to the company s decision to not compete in irrationally priced certificate of deposit campaigns 
reduced interest expense and advertising expense were the benefits of this decision 
of the of increased other expenses  one of the largest increases was the cost for fdic insurance 
prior to  the bank s cost for deposit insurance was limited to its share of the fico expense 
beginning at the end of the second quarter of  as the balance in the fdic insurance fund was low  once again banking institutions began paying premiums for deposit insurance 
this premium for was over  and represented a increase in cost over costs to provide online banking services increased dramatically from to this was a result of a greatly increased number of users of online banking services as well as bill paying service 
other components of increased other expense resulted from the company s increased asset size as related to various regulatory and compliance issues 
some of these costs were one time expenses and therefore will not be present during for vs 
total noninterest income increased year over year by  or 
this growth was attributable to various sources including trust and investment services  revenues from the bank s insurance agency  gains on sales of investment securities and gains on company owned life insurance 
fee income generated from fiduciary and investment services provided by the bank s trust and investment services division increased by over income from trust and estate commissions totaled and fees from investment management and custodial accounts totaled fees in the trust and investment services division were higher than primarily due to the final commissions received from the closure of three trust accounts and an estate account 
these fees represent one time commissions and are not recognized until the accounts are closed and in the case of an estate account  the estate is settled 
during  total new assets under management from outside sources and from assets distributed from trusts and retained within the trust division totaled  plans began in for combining the trust and investment services division with bank of smithtown financial services inc 
the two divisions share some common services  but often have dissimilar customer profiles 
as these customers proceed through their life cycles  they often use different services offered by the two divisions at different points in time 
combining the two segments of business has provided synergies and convenient referral business for both divisions 
gross revenues from the bank s insurance agency also increased during over  by 
net income derived from the agency increased by 
this increase was due primarily to unplanned commission income received from insurance carriers 
was the second full year of operation for the agency under the bank s management 
synergies between the bank and agency continue to grow  with resultant expense reductions and referral income growth 
plans for additional cost reductions were underway  with increased net income projections for the agency for the gain on the sale of investment securities increased noninterest income by this gain resulted from the sale of  of municipal and mortgage backed securities 
the three sold securities had maturity dates beyond twenty years 
the sale was transacted in order to replace lower yielding securities on the balance sheet with higher yielding loans 
it is not the intent of management to trade securities within its portfolio  and therefore most investments are held to maturity or call date 
miscellaneous fee income also increased by during over the majority of this income came from various new commercial services offered by the bank out of its newest branch locations opened during there were small declines in service charge income during that were the result of free checking accounts 
although these service charges declined  the fee income received from the overdraft honor program continued at its pace  providing substantial fee income in addition to regular overdraft fees 
the gain in cash value of company owned life insurance declined by during this life insurance was purchased to partially offset the cost for various benefit plans provided by the bank such as group term life insurance  director and executive incentive retirement plans and a supplemental executive retirement agreement for the chief executive officer 
during   of policies were transferred through a exchange to a different insurance carrier from general account to separate account policies 
due diligence was conducted on the new carrier and various benefits associated with separate account policies were recognized during  one of which is a higher rate of return to the bank 
total noninterest expense increased by during over the common thread between all of the components of this increased expense was the company s growth 
the construction of new branch offices in combination with renovations of older  existing offices increased occupancy expense and furniture and equipment expense by over in depreciation expense on leasehold and building improvements as well as computer equipment increased by or over levels 
office rental expense increased by or over costs 
the expense for computer equipment increased by or 
all of these costs reflect the expenses associated with the new style  brand defining branch offices for which bank of smithtown has been widely recognized 
the last eight branch offices were built in the style of customer centric design  with open spaces for universal bankers to serve customers  with areas set aside for viewing the latest financial news as well as bank products and services  and segregated areas for private customer and banker discussions with laptop computers 
gourmet coffee bars add a relaxing atmosphere for conversing between customers and bankers 
results obtained from these new style branches have been the subject of many local and national newspapers and magazines 
salary and benefit expenses also rose from to by and  respectively 
these higher levels of expenses resulted from increased staffing requirements as well as ordinary year over year increases 
other significant increased noninterest expense items included legal fees and audit and accounting fees 
these costs increased by in total  or 
these were the primary expenses associated with the formation of bos preferred funding corp 
during  and the associated benefit received by the company far outweighed the set up costs 
for and years thereafter  there will be annual administration and tax service costs  significantly reduced from first year implementation costs 
another material expense included in the noninterest expense category was the amortization of intangible assets  which increased from to in this increase was due to the timing of additional installment payments made to the prior owners of the seigerman mulvey insurance agency during as part of the contractual purchase agreement and due to applying an accelerated method of amortization 
the final payment for the agency was made in the expenses related to electronic banking including online banking  atm processing and debit card costs increased dramatically during this was the result of increased interchange costs  website changes and activity charges related to the processing of atm and debit card transactions 
the volume of these transactions increased tremendously throughout the number of debit card transactions rapidly caught up with paper check transactions 
looking ahead to  these types of transactions will continue to grow  but expense should decline for the company 
on september   the company signed an agreement with jack henry associates  inc to convert their core processing software 
preparation began for this conversion in and it was commenced in mid as part of the conversion  the company will be processing its own atm and debit card transactions rather than relying on an intermediary 
this should result in significant cost savings 
the expense for the jack henry conversion was  but all of these costs will be capitalized for between and years  and it will provide greater efficiencies for staff and much enhanced information for the bank and its customers 
the company s effective tax rate for was reduced due to the savings in new york state taxes resulting from the formation of the real estate investment trust 
the effective tax rate for and was and  respectively 
in spite of the increased noninterest expenses of  the efficiency ratio improved from to a result of minimal increases in staff performing the same functions on a greatly increased asset base 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk significant increases in the level of market interest rates may adversely affect the fair value of securities and other interest earning assets 
at december  and  the following levels of securities and loans carried fixed interest rates balance of portfolio balance of portfolio investment securities   loans   generally  the value of fixed rate investments varies inversely to changes in interest rates 
as a result  increases in interest rates could result in decreases in the market value of interest earning assets 
this decrease in market value could adversely affect the company s results of operations if the loans or securities were sold or  in the case of interest earning assets classified as available for sale  could reduce the company s stockholders equity if they were to be retained 
a significant increase in the level of market interest rates could also adversely affect the bank s net interest income and net interest margin 
now accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts all can be repriced on a daily basis 
if they were all to be repriced upward due to the competitive pressures of a general increase in market rates  net interest income could be reduced 
based on historical experience  increases in deposit rates typically lag increases in loan rates  in which case  the increase in interest expense on these deposits would be offset by the increase in interest income on the loans 
the bank monitors and controls interest rate risk through a variety of techniques including the use of interest rate sensitivity models and interest rate gap analysis 
both of these techniques project future net interest income based on changes in interest rates 
gap analysis requires estimates of when all categories of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will reprice 
gap analysis looks at stated maturities and assumes all assets and liabilities within the same maturity time frame will reprice 
it does not look at the probability of repricing  which in the case of nonmaturity deposits  is up to the discretion of management 
interest rate sensitivity models also rely on various estimates and assumptions  and although a great deal of time and effort is devoted to arriving at these assumptions  any change in the assumptions input to the model can produce very different results 
therefore  both of these techniques may not accurately reflect the actual impact of changes in the interest rate environment on the bank s net interest income 
in spite of these shortcomings  the bank utilizes the results of the dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure to net interest income fluctuations resulting from sustained interest rate changes 
management monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon 
the results of the sensitivity analysis are compared to policy limits set internally by the asset liability committee that specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon given both an upward and downward shift in interest rates 
the last simulation analysis was modeled on a one hundred and two hundred basis point upward and one hundred and two hundred basis point downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a twelve month period is assumed 
the following table reflects the bank s income sensitivity analysis as of november  and change in interest as of november  as of november  rates in basis points potential change in potential change in rate shock net interest income net interest income change change change change up basis points  up basis points  static down basis points
