hospital specialty and programmatic ratings we currently provide risk adjusted hospital quality ratings for medical issues 
in addition  users can compare hospitals utilizing our programmatic ratings for maternity care 
we have termed these programmatic ratings because our maternity care ratings are based in part upon the presence or absence in a hospital s maternity care program  of specified attributes  described below  and not solely on mortality or complication rates at a discrete medical issue level as is the case with our other ratings 
for each particular medical issue chosen by the user  other than those relating to maternity care and women s health  we provide a rating system of five stars  three stars or one star five stars is the highest rating  one star is the lowest for virtually every hospital in the united states 
we base all of our ratings  except ratings on maternity care and women s health  bariatric surgery  and appendectomy  on three years of medpar medicare provider analysis and review data that we purchase from the centers for medicare and medicaid services  known as cms 
maternity care and women s health  bariatric surgery  and appendectomy ratings are based on the all payer data sets made available by states 
the medpar and state databases contain the inpatient records of medicare patients and all patients in those states  respectively 
we apply transparent but proprietary algorithms to the data to account for variations in risk in order to make the data comparable from hospital to hospital 
in the initial analysis of the data  a separate data set is created for each group of patients having a specific procedure or diagnosis eg  coronary bypass surgery  total hip replacement  based on icd cm international classification of diseases  clinical modification coding 
the icd cm is the widely adopted system of assigning codes to diagnoses and procedures associated with hospital utilization in the united states 
the icd cm is used to code and classify mortality data from death certificates 
each group of patients is defined by using the information on diagnoses and procedures coded in the patient records 
the quality measure for some procedures or diagnoses is mortality  while the quality measure for others is major complications 
generally  approximately to of hospitals studied are classified as three stars 
the three star rating is applied when there is no difference  statistically speaking  between a hospital s predicted and actual performance 
approximately to of hospitals are rated five stars  which means that their performance is statistically better than expected 
approximately to of hospitals are rated one star  meaning that their performance was statistically worse than expected 
for our maternity care ratings and women s health  bariatric surgery  and appendectomy  which also are subject to the five star rating system  we use state all payer files from individual states derived from the inpatient records of persons who utilize hospitals in those states 
the states represented on the site are arizona  california  florida  iowa  maine  maryland  massachusetts  nevada  new jersey  new york  north carolina  oregon  pennsylvania  rhode island  texas  utah  virginia  washington  and wisconsin 
this data represents all discharges for the states over a three year period set from for maternity care  we analyzed several factors  such as volume of vaginal and cesarean delivery complications  for each hospital within the all payer states 
we then developed a system that assigned a weight to each factor based on its importance to the quality of maternity care 
based upon the application of this system  the top of hospitals in the states receive five stars  the middle receive three stars and the bottom receive one star 
for the women s health ratings  the ratings are based upon outcomes in maternity care services and cardiac stroke mortality outcomes for women 
the top of hospitals in the states receive five stars  the middle receive three stars and the bottom receive one star 

table of contents bariatric surgery and appendectomy ratings are based on the presence of major complications 
these ratings are created using the same methodology as the medpar ratings but are based on the state data available in the states 
institutional and service line hospital awards we recognize exceptional quality outcomes at an institutional level eg hospital clinical excellence and patient safety as well as at a service line level 
hospitals that achieve distinction from us for their exceptional quality outcomes receive our distinguished hospital award for clinical excellence dha ce 
this is an annual distinction that we typically announce at the beginning of each calendar year 
in  hospitals nationwide received the dha ce designation  which identifies hospitals with clinical outcomes in the top in the country 
for the award year  hospitals were segregated into two groups teaching and non teaching 
teaching hospitals are identified by the following method a hospital is designated by healthgrades as a teaching hospital if they indicated they were a teaching hospital in their medicare cost report  or if their indirect medical education ime payment was at least one percent of their overall reimbursement  as indicated in the most recent year of medpar data 
if a hospital indicated they were a teaching hospital but did not receive ime payment  they were contacted to confirm teaching status 
to be considered for the distinguished hospital award for clinical excellence dha ce  a hospital had to have received star ratings in at least of the healthgrades procedures and diagnoses ratings using medpar data 
after creating a list of hospitals that met the above criteria  we took the following steps to determine the dha ce recipients 
calculated the average overall star rating for each hospital by averaging all their medpar based ratings 
calculated the average z score standard score for each hospital by averaging all their medpar based z scores 
ranked hospitals in descending order by their average star rating within the two groups teaching and non teaching 
broke ranking ties by average z score 
selected the top percent of hospitals from each group 
excluded hospitals whose average star was less than 
designated the hospitals that remained on the list as dha ce recipients 
hospitals that achieve distinction from us for their exceptional patient safety performance receive our annual distinguished hospital award for patient safety dha ps 
this distinction is based on of the agency for healthcare research and quality s ahrq patient safety indicators psi s including  among others  post operative hip fracture  post operative hemorrhage or hematoma and post operative sepsis and recognizes exceptional experience regarding the number and type of patient safety incidents within a hospital 
we utilized the psi software developed by ahrq to determine the patient safety rates for each individual psi 
we then created an overall patient safety score for every hospital utilizing the psi software developed by ahrq 
for our award year  we segregated hospitals between teaching and non teaching 
in order to achieve distinction  hospitals were required to have an average overall healthgrades star rating of at least and have a healthgrades star rating in a minimum number of of the medical issues we rate using medpar data 
the top  or hospitals  that met these criteria  ranked in descending order by their average overall patient safety score  from each of the groups teaching and non teaching were awarded the dha ps designation 
in  recipients of the dha ps represented less than of the total hospitals evaluated 
nationwide  teaching hospitals and non teaching hospitals received the dha ps designation in each year we issue specialty excellence awards to hospitals performing in the top ten percent in the nation in clinical excellence in each of specialty care areas that include bariatric surgery  cardiac care  cardiac surgery  critical care  coronary intervention  gastrointestinal  gastrointestinal surgery  general surgery  joint replacement  orthopedic  pulmonary  spine surgery  stroke  vascular  maternity care and women s health 
physician quality reports we provide quality information on over  physicians 
this information includes  to the extent available through our data sources  primary and secondary specialty areas  medical school attended  years since medical school  residency  memberships  fellowships  address  telephone number  board certification  malpractice data  hospital affiliation and federal or state medical board sanction information

nursing home ratings we provide ratings of the performance of nursing homes across the united states that are medicare or medicaid certified and active in these programs 
we typically update these ratings on a monthly basis 
in preparing the ratings  we analyze licensing survey data from cms s online survey certification and reporting oscar database and complaint data from cms s skilled nursing facility snf complaint database 
licensing surveys are inspections that assess compliance with standards of patient care such as staffing  quality of care and cleanliness 
complaint surveys are investigations of complaints and serious problems 
nursing homes whose most recent survey date was more than months prior to the date the data was received by us are not included in the analysis 
stand alone medicare and or medicaid nursing homes are analyzed apart from medicare  hospital based nursing homes 
we do not rate medicare  hospital based nursing homes because these facilities are designed for short term patient care 
in addition  nursing homes with only one licensing survey are not included in our analysis 
the ratings are assigned on a state by state basis  rather than nationally  because the surveys from which information is derived are conducted by state agencies  and there may be variations between the states survey processes and results 
the highest rated of nursing homes receive five stars  the middle of nursing homes receive three stars and the bottom receive one star

competition with respect to our quality services for hospitals  we face competition from data providers such as solucient and healthcare consulting companies such as ge medical systems  carescience and premier that offer certain consulting services to hospitals 
many of these companies have well established consulting practices with a large number of employees dedicated to these services 
the ability to demonstrate the value of marketing and consulting programs  name brand recognition and cost are the principal factors that affect competition 

table of contents we face competition with respect to our service offerings to employers  benefits consulting firms  payers  consumers and others from companies that provide online information and decision support tools regarding healthcare providers and physicians 
several companies currently offer online healthcare information and support tools such as webmd and ingenix 
webmd has a well established web platform which is widely known as the most trafficked healthcare website on the internet today for general healthcare content 
however  we believe that the more than three million unique consumers who visit our website each month are active consumers that are searching for very targeted information such as selection of a healthcare provider 
we believe that the ability to provide accurate and comprehensive healthcare information in a manner that is cost effective to the client is the principal factor that affects competition in this area 
we compete with internet advertising companies and face competition from companies that offer traditional media advertising opportunities 
we also compete with websites that provide their own or user generated content and seek to provide advertising to their users such as revolution health and ucompare healthcare 
our public website faces competition from numerous other companies  both in attracting users and in generating revenue from advertisers and sponsors 
competition for users will include online services and websites that provide health related information  including both commercial sites and not for profit sites 
we will also compete for advertisers and sponsors with both healthcare related and non healthcare related content and services 
company history we are a delaware corporation incorporated in december under the name specialty care network  inc upon commencement of operations in  we were principally engaged in the management of physician practices engaged in musculoskeletal care  which is the treatment of conditions relating to bones  joints  muscles and connective tissues 
during  we began to focus on the provision of healthcare information through the establishment of our healthcare provider quality ratings and profile information  which we first introduced on our website 
since that time  we have expanded the scope of our healthcare information services to encompass the additional services described above 
in january  we changed our name to healthgrades 
com  inc in november  we changed our name to health grades  inc government regulation the delivery of healthcare services has become one of the most highly regulated of professional and business endeavors in the united states 
both the federal government and the individual state governments are responsible for overseeing the activities of individuals and businesses engaged in the delivery of healthcare services 
the focus of federal regulation of healthcare businesses and professionals is based primarily upon their participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
each of these programs is financed  at least in part  with federal funds 
state jurisdiction is based upon its financing of healthcare as well as the states authority to regulate and protect the health and welfare of its citizens 
a provision of the federal social security act  commonly known as the anti kickback statute  prohibits kickbacks  rebates and bribes in return for referrals of federal health care program services 
this law provides an extremely broad base for finding violations 
indeed  any remuneration  direct or indirect  offered  paid  solicited  or received  in return for referrals of patients or business for which payment may be made in whole or in part under medicare  or a state healthcare program medicaid could be considered a violation of law 
the language of the anti kickback statute also prohibits payments made to anyone to induce them to recommend purchasing  leasing  or ordering any good  facility  service  or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part by a federal health care program 
criminal penalties under the anti kickback statute include fines up to  imprisonment for up to years  or both 
in addition  acts constituting a violation of the anti kickback statute may lead to additional civil penalties  such as fines  assessments and exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
to provide more direct guidance on the interpretation of the anti kickback statute  the office of inspector general  or oig  of the department of health and human services dhhs has developed regulations regarding what types of business arrangements are not to be considered violative of the law and to develop criteria to be applied to any new arrangement to determine whether it is acceptable under the law 
the regulations are known as safe harbors and address activities that may technically violate the anti kickback statute  but are not to be considered as illegal when structured to conform with the proposed regulation 
the oig has also set forth specific procedures by which the dhhs  through the oig  in consultation with the department of justice doj  will issue advisory opinions to outside parties regarding the interpretation and applicability of anti kickback and certain other statutes relating to federal and state healthcare programs 

table of contents whenever an arrangement exists with an entity capable of providing services reimbursed by medicare or medicaid  the arrangement must be analyzed to determine if the anti kickback statute is implicated ie  can the arrangement be characterized as involving remuneration intended to induce referrals for the provision of covered services 
because our customers will  in some instances  be healthcare providers  we must be mindful of state and federal laws  that is  we want to be sure that any payments to us will not be considered a payment for a referral of patients or business that healthgrades controls 
the only payments made to us by providers and practitioners will be for access to information  to make their healthgrades profiles available to consumers without cost  or for evaluation and consulting services not to induce referrals 
nevertheless  federal courts have interpreted the anti kickback provisions very broadly to prohibit even those payments made in return for legitimate services  if the intent to induce referrals can be inferred from the arrangement 
where the payments made under an agreement represent fair market value or reasonable remuneration for the goods  services or other consideration being received  however  there should be less factual support for any inference that payments are in exchange for referrals 
there is a potential that our arrangements could be brought within the personal services and management agreement safe harbor regulation enacted under the anti kickback statute 
the personal services and management agreement safe harbors provide that payments under such agreements will not constitute remuneration under the anti kickback statute if the payments meet seven criteria  including that the agreement is set out in writing and is signed by the parties  and that aggregate compensation is set in advance  is consistent with fair market value and does not take into account the volume or value of any referrals or business generated between the parties 
unless an arrangement meets all of the terms of a safe harbor  the government could attempt to draw an inference that payments made constitute remuneration and that at least one purpose of the remuneration is to induce referrals 
however  failure to meet the safe harbors does not render an arrangement per se unlawful 
we believe that our operations comply with applicable legal regulatory requirements of the anti kickback statute s personal services and or management agreement safe harbor 
however  some of these laws have been applied to payments by physicians for marketing and referral services and could constrain our relationships  including financial and marketing relationships with customers such as hospitals 
it also is possible that additional or changed laws  regulations or guidelines could be adopted in the future that could affect our business 
many states have laws that prohibit payment of kickbacks or other payment of remuneration to those in a position to control the referral of patients similar to the anti kickback statute 
therefore  it is possible that our activities may be found not to comply with these laws 
noncompliance with such laws could subject us to penalties and sanctions 
we do not believe that we are in violation of any legal requirements under such state laws 
in addition to the anti kickback statute  the making of false claims to the federal government is prohibited by federal criminal and civil statutes 
criminal provisions prohibit knowingly filing false claims  making false statements or claims to be made by others 
civil provisions under the federal false claims act fca prohibit the filing of claims  or causing the filing of claims  that the person filing knew were false 
criminal penalties include fines and imprisonment 
civil penalties under the fca include fines up to  per claim  plus treble damages  for each claim filed 
in addition  under the deficit reduction act of  states are encouraged to enact their own false claims laws  which could increase the number of false claims suits at the state level 
although we are not filing claims ourselves  liability under the fca can extend to those who cause the filings of claims 
to the extent that consulting advice provided to our customers could be construed as aiding or abetting the presentation of false claims by our customers  there could be false claims liability  although we endeavor to provide advice that cannot be so construed 
healthcare legislation 
it is our belief that the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of has not had a major impact on our arrangements with providers 
future legislation may be introduced and considered by congress and state legislatures that is designed to change access to and payment for healthcare services in the united states 
we can make no prediction as to whether future legislation will be enacted or  if enacted  the effect that such legislation will have on us 

table of contents privacy of information and hipaa consumers sometimes enter private information about themselves or their family members when using our services 
also  our systems record use patterns when consumers access our databases that may reveal health related information or other private information about the user 
in addition  information regarding employee usage of healthcare providers and facilities can also be compiled by our systems in connection with services we offer to employers and other payers 
numerous federal and state laws and regulations govern collection  dissemination  use and confidentiality of patient identifiable health information  including state privacy and confidentiality laws  state laws regulating healthcare professionals  such as physicians  pharmacists and nurse practitioners  medicaid laws  the us health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  as described in detail below  and related rules proposed by the health care financing administration  and cms standards for electronic transmission of health data under hipaa  congress set national standards for the protection of health information created  maintained or transmitted by health plans  health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers covered entities 
under the law and regulations known collectively as the privacy and security rules  covered entities must implement standards to protect and guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information 
although we are not a covered entity  we believe that we have complied with the applicable standards 
failure to timely implement these standards could  under certain circumstances  trigger the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 
the privacy and security rules do not replace federal  state  or other law that grants individuals even greater privacy protections  and covered entities are free to retain or adopt more protective policies or practices 
most healthcare providers and payers do not carry out all of their healthcare activities and functions by themselves 
instead  they often use the services of a variety of other persons or businesses 
the privacy and security rules allow covered entities to disclose protected health information to business associates if the covered entities obtain satisfactory assurances that the business associate will use the information only for the purposes for which it was engaged  will safeguard the information from misuse  and will comply with certain other requirements under the privacy and security rules 
covered entities may disclose protected health information to an entity in its role as a business associate only to help covered entity carry out its healthcare functions not for the business associate s independent use or purposes  except as needed for the proper management and administration of the business associate 
although we are not a covered entity  we may be asked to enter into business associate agreements with covered entities 
to the extent we have entered into such agreement  we believe that we are in compliance with the requirement of those agreements 
if a covered entity finds out about a material breach or violation of the privacy related provisions of the contract by the business associate  it must take reasonable steps to cure the breach or end the violation  and  if unsuccessful  terminate the contract with the business associate 
if termination is not feasible eg  where there are no other viable business alternatives for the covered entity  the covered entity must report the problem to the department of health and human services office for civil rights 
government regulation of the internet  data and privacy the internet is currently the subject of a number of statues and regulations  and the trend for the foreseeable future appears to be that of an increase in the quantity and the complexity of regulation 
any new or revised law or regulation pertaining to the internet  or the application or interpretation of existing laws and regulations  could decrease demand for our services  increase our cost of doing business  decrease the availability of the data we obtain and use from third parties  increase the costs of online marketing  or otherwise cause our business to suffer 
laws and regulations have been adopted in the united states and throughout the world  and additional laws and regulations may be adopted in the future  that address internet  data and privacy related issues  including online content  privacy  online marketing  unsolicited commercial e mail  pricing and quality of products and services 
this legislation could increase our cost of doing business and negatively affect our business 
moreover  it will take many years to determine the full extent to which older laws and regulations governing issues like property ownership  libel  negligence  taxes  and personal privacy are applicable to the internet 

table of contents currently  us privacy law consists of numerous disparate state and federal statutes regulations and enforcement actions regulating specific industries that collect personal data  or particular types or uses of personal data 
for example  hipaa consists of a large body of statutory provisions and regulations that control the disclosure  use  and transfer of personal health information in digital form by providers and others 
one recent trend is the enactment of privacy and security statutes that require the disclosure to authorities and to data subjects of any breach of security of a database of personal information 
several other privacy laws and regulations predate and therefore do not specifically address online activities 
in addition  a number of comprehensive legislative and regulatory privacy proposals have taken effect or are now under consideration by federal  state and local governments in the united states 
all such privacy laws may decrease access to the raw data that we use  adversely impact our ability to use data currently in our possession and may increase our costs of compliance with such laws and regulations in the conduct of our business 
in addition  the regulation of the internet outside the united states may affect our cost of doing business  directly or indirectly  in the long run 
for example  privacy law in the european union and in a number of other countries is far more restrictive then us privacy law in terms of how personal information may be collected  stored  processed  transmitted  and shared with others 
as a result  the company may not be able to profitably expand its business to the european union or other countries that have similar laws  and the company may not be able to realize the benefits of reducing costs by outsourcing any of its operations that involve the processing of personal information to such countries 
further  the more restrictive privacy and other internet related laws and regulations in other countries have served as a model for newer and more restrictive privacy and other internet laws and regulations in the united states 
intellectual property we regard the protection of our intellectual property rights to be important 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark  trade secret restrictions and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights 
we require selected employees to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements as well as non competition agreements 
the contractual provisions and other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter third parties from developing similar or competing technologies 
we own federal trademark registrations for the marks healthgrades  healthgrades checkmark star logo  and the phrase  guiding america to better healthcare 
there is significant uncertainty regarding the scope of protection offered under existing laws regarding matters such as property ownership and other intellectual property rights with respect to the internet and databases 
the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet and  as a result  may not fully contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet  databases and related technologies 
in addition  new laws that regulate activities on the internet have been passed and may be passed  which may have unanticipated effects 
for further information  see risk factors our propriety rights may not be fully protected 
employees as of december   we had employees  most of whom were located at our corporate offices in golden  colorado 
of these employees  were engaged in sales and marketing  client consulting or client administrative support  in product development including information technology web development and in general and administrative including finance  accounting  it infrastructure  etc we are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements

risk factors our short and long term success is subject to many factors beyond our control 
if any of the following risks  as well as any risks described elsewhere in this form k  actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer 
other risks not presently known to us or not presently thought to be material could also affect our business  our financial condition or results of operations 
given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
risks related to our business our business will suffer if we are not able to obtain reliable data as a basis for our healthcare information 
to provide our healthcare information  we must be able to receive comprehensive  reliable data 
we obtain this data from a number of public and private sources 
currently  the information we utilize to compile our hospital ratings is acquired from the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms and individual states 
for the year ended december   revenues derived from sqp  sqi  and qai products accounted for approximately of our total ratings and advisory revenue 
these products are based exclusively on our hospital ratings 
moreover  some of our health management suite modules are based on information acquired from cms 
our business could suffer if cms or our other data sources began charging for use or access to this data  or cease to make such information available  and suitable alternative sources were not identified on a timely basis 
moreover  our ability to attract and retain customers depends on the reliability of the information that we use and purchase 
if our information is inaccurate or otherwise erroneous  our reputation and customer following could be damaged 
in the past  we have had disputes with two providers of information who sought to terminate our arrangements based on allegations  which we denied  that our use of the information violated the terms of our agreements with the providers 
we have located alternate sources of information or modified the scope of information provided in response to these disputes 
nevertheless  our failure to obtain suitable information  if needed to use in place of information provided by a source that stops providing information or that charges substantially more for such data  could hurt our business 
failure to effectively manage the growth of our operations and infrastructure could disrupt our operations and prevent us from maintaining or increasing profitablity 
we have expanded meaningfully in the past few years and we continue to seek to increase our sales efforts  attract new clients  maintain existing clients and develop new products 
to manage our growth  we must successfully attract qualified personnel and successfully integrate new personnel into our operations 
our failure to manage personnel and otherwise appropriately manage expansion of our business could adversely affect our business and future growth 
should our website traffic continue to grow and we do not maintain the appropriate infrastructure to support the growth and new technologies  our business will be harmed 
our proprietary rights may not be fully protected 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  our business could be harmed by making it easier for our competitors to duplicate our services 
while we have certain trademarks and copyrights that have been registered with the us patent and trademark office and the us copyright office  respectively  such trademarks and copyrights may not offer adequate protection 
in addition  we require some of our employees to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements and  in more limited cases  non competition agreements 
nevertheless  our efforts to establish and protect our proprietary rights may be inadequate to prevent imitation of our services or branding by others or may be subject to challenge by others 
furthermore  our ability to protect some of our proprietary rights is uncertain since legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of intellectual property rights in internet related industries are uncertain and are still evolving 
in addition  although we have obtained copyright registrations for some of our databases such registrations and existing laws may not allow us to adequately protect the underlying data contained in such databases 
accordingly  third parties may contend they are free to use portions of the data contained in such databases 
also  our current rights and existing laws do not preclude competitors from independently developing businesses with functionality or features substantially equivalent or superior to our business 
any infringement  misappropriation or third party development could have a material adverse effect on us 

table of contents the nature of our business and our reliance on intellectual property subjects us to the risk of litigation 
from time to time  it has been necessary for us to resort to litigation and threats of litigation to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights 
for example  we currently have claims pending against one hospital for copyright and trademark infringement and breach of contract 
the results of litigation are inherently uncertain and may result in adverse rulings or decisions 
we may enter into settlements or be subject to judgments that may  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on us 
the litigation  regardless of its outcome  diverts management resources  may be expensive  and may not effectively protect our intellectual property 
in addition to the risk of failing to adequately protect our proprietary rights  there is a risk that we may become subject to claims that we infringe upon the proprietary rights of others 
the possibility of inadvertently infringing upon the proprietary rights of another is increased for businesses such as ours because there is significant uncertainty regarding the applicability to the internet of existing laws regarding matters such as copyrights and other intellectual property rights 
a claim of intellectual property infringement may cause us to incur significant expenses in defending against the claim 
if we are not successful in defending against an infringement claim  we could be liable for substantial damages or may be prevented from offering some aspects of our services 
we may be required to make royalty payments  which could be substantial  to a party claiming that we have infringed their rights 
these events could damage our business 
any significant litigation could cause us to incur substantial expense to protect our rights 
we may lose business if hospitals and others utilize our name and ratings without our permission 
in order for a hospital to use our name and ratings information  we require them to enter into a marketing agreement with us 
however  some hospitals  the media and others have taken the position that certain use of our ratings is fair use and not proprietary 
we will need to continue to enforce the protection of our proprietary information and aggressively pursue selected hospitals and others that utilize our name and ratings information without our permission 
if our enforcement efforts are unsuccessful  our business may be adversely affected 
we may be sued for information we obtain or information retrieved from our websites or otherwise provided to employers and others 
we may be subjected to claims for defamation  negligence  copyright or trademark or patent infringement  personal injury or other legal theories relating to the information we publish on our websites or otherwise provide to customers 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against online services as well as print publications in the past 
we have received threats from some providers that they will assert defamation and other claims in connection with the information posted on our healthgrades 
com website 
we have had disputes with certain physicians with respect to the accuracy of their data that is included in reports we sell or otherwise provide to consumers and professionals  and have settled litigation with some of these physicians 
continuing to improve the accuracy of our data by both internal process measures and by obtaining data from various sources for comparative purposes will continue to be important for us 
patients who file lawsuits against providers often name as defendants all persons or companies with any nexus to the providers 
as a result  patients may file lawsuits against us based on  among other things  treatment provided by hospitals or other facilities that are highly rated by us  or by doctors who are identified on our website 
in addition  a court or government agency may take the position that our delivery of health information directly  or information delivered by a third party website that a consumer accesses through our website  exposes us to malpractice or other personal injury liability for wrongful delivery of healthcare services or erroneous health information 
such exposure may adversely affect our business 
moreover  the amount of insurance we maintain may not be sufficient to cover all of the losses we might incur from these claims and legal actions 
in addition  insurance for some risks is difficult  impossible or too costly to obtain  and as a result  we may not be able to purchase insurance for some types of risks 

table of contents if we do not strengthen recognition of our brand name  our ability to expand our business will be impaired 
to expand our audience of online users  increase our online traffic and increase interest in our other healthcare information services  we must strengthen recognition of our brand name 
to be successful in this effort  consumers must perceive us as a trusted source of healthcare information  hospitals and other providers must perceive us as an effective marketing and sales channel for their services and products  and employees  payers  insurers  and others must perceive us as a source of valuable information that can be used to enhance the quality and cost effectiveness of healthcare 
we may be required to increase substantially our marketing budget in our efforts to strengthen brand name recognition 
our business will suffer if our efforts are not productive 
if we were to lose the services of kerry hicks or other members of our senior management team  we may not be able to execute our business strategy 
our future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team 
in particular  our ceo  kerry hicks  is critical to the overall management of healthgrades as well as the development of our technology  our culture and our strategic direction 
all of our executive officers and key employees are at will employees  and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
the loss of any of our management or key personnel could seriously harm our business 
our business will suffer if we are unable to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
our ability to execute our business plan and be successful depends upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees when needed 
as we expand our business  we need to hire additional personnel to support our information technology operations in particular 
we may be unable to retain our key employees or attract or retain other highly qualified employees in the future 
if we do not succeed in attracting new personnel as needed and retaining and motivating our current personnel  our business will suffer 
we may experience system failures that could interrupt our services 
the success of our www 
healthgrades 
com website and activities related to the website will depend on the capacity  reliability and security of our network infrastructure 
we rely on telecommunications providers to provide the external telecommunications infrastructure necessary for internet communications 
we also depend on providers of online content and services for some of the content and applications that we make available through healthgrades 
com 
any significant interruptions in our services or increases in response time could result in the loss of potential or existing users or customers 
although we maintain insurance for our business  we cannot guarantee that our insurance will be adequate to compensate us for losses that may occur or to provide for costs associated with business interruptions 
we must be able to operate our website hours a day  days a week  without material interruption 
to operate without interruption  we and our content providers must guard against damage from fire  power loss and other natural disasters  communications failures  software and hardware errors  failures or crashes  security breaches  computer viruses and similar disruptive problems  and other potential interruptions 
our website may be required to accommodate a high volume of traffic and deliver frequently updated information 
our website users may experience slower response times or system failures due to increased traffic on our website or for a variety of other reasons 
we could experience disruptions or interruptions in service due to the failure or delay in the transmission or receipt of this information 
any significant interruption of our operations could damage our business 

table of contents failure by third party vendors of technology 
our business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our users 
internet access providers may be able to block  degrade or charge for access to certain of our products and services  which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of users and advertisers 
our business also depends on the ability of our users to access the internet and certain of our data offerings require significant bandwidth to work effectively 
currently  this access is provided by a company with significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace 
while interference with access to our website seems unlikely  such carrier interference could result in a loss of existing users and advertisers and increased costs  and could impair our ability to attract new users and advertisers  thereby harming our revenue and growth 
we may lose business if we are unable to keep up with rapid technological or other changes 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving technological standards in the industry  frequent new service and product announcements and changing consumer demand 
if we are unable to keep up with changing technology and other factors related to our market  we may be unable to attract and retain users or customers  which would reduce or limit our revenues 
our future success will depend on our ability to adapt to these changes  and to continuously improve the content  features and reliability of our services in response to competitive service and product offerings and the evolving demands of the marketplace 
in addition  the widespread adoption of new internet networking  telecommunications or development technologies  or other technological changes could require us to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our website or infrastructure  which might negatively affect our ability to remain profitable 
we rely largely on advertising and search engine placement to generate traffic to our website 
we rely on online media to attract a significant percentage of the visitors to our website 
prices for online advertising could increase as a result of increased demand for advertising inventory  which would cause our expenses to increase and could result in lower margins 
our advertising contracts with online search engines are typically short term 
if one or more search engines on which we rely for advertising modifies or terminates its relationship with us  our expenses could increase  the number of visitors we generate could decrease and our revenues or margins could decline 
additionally  changes to our position within search engine search results could cause visits to our website and the number of reports ordered from our website to decline 
we may be unsuccessful in our efforts to increase advertising and sponsorship revenue 
we began to offer advertising on our website at www 
healthgrades 
com in the latter half of however  our ability to realize revenue from this initiative is subject to substantial uncertainty including  but not limited to the following our public website will face competition from numerous other companies  both in attracting users and in generating revenue from advertisers and sponsors 
we will compete for users with online services and web sites that provide health related information  including both commercial sites and not for profit sites 
we will also compete for advertisers and sponsors with both healthcare related and non healthcare related content and services 
our advertising initiative is in its early stages 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development and other resources than we do 
these organizations may be better known than we are and have more customers or users than we do 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these organizations or any alliances they have formed or may form 
as there are no substantial barriers to entry into the online advertising market  we expect that competitors will continue to enter this market 
there are numerous items outside of our control that may limit our ability to accurately forecast or generate revenues from this area including  but not limited to advertisers budgets and buying patterns  the time between the initial contact with an advertising network  agency or potential advertiser sponsor and the execution of a contract  which may be lengthy and seasonal factors relating to the prevalence of specific health conditions that may affect the timing of promotional campaigns for specific products  among other items 
failure to effectively compete for online advertising may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations

the market for healthcare information is new  rapidly evolving and competitive 
we expect competition to increase significantly  and our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to compete successfully 
we currently compete  or potentially compete  with many providers of healthcare information services and products  both online and through traditional means

risks related to healthcare information and the internet 
healthcare reforms and the cost of regulatory compliance could negatively affect our business 
the healthcare industry is heavily regulated 
in the ordinary course of business  healthcare entities and companies that do business with them are subject to state and federal regulatory scrutiny  supervision  oversight and control 
these various laws  regulations and guidelines affect  among other matters  the provision  licensing  labeling  marketing  promotion and reimbursement of healthcare services and products 
our failure or the failure of our customers to comply with any applicable legal or regulatory requirements  or any investigation or audit of our or our customers practices could result in limitation or prohibition of business activities  subject us or our customers to legal fees and expenses and adverse publicity  or increase the costs of regulatory compliance and  if found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have engaged in improper practices  subject us or our customers to criminal or civil monetary fines or other penalties a federal law commonly known as the anti kickback statute prohibits kickbacks  rebates and bribes in return for referrals of federal health care program services 
this law provides an extremely broad base for finding violations 
indeed  any remuneration  direct or indirect  offered  paid  solicited or received in return for referrals of patients or business for which payment may be made in whole or in part under medicare or medicaid could be considered a violation of law 
the statute also prohibits payments made to anyone to induce them to recommend purchasing  leasing or ordering any good  facility  service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part by medicare 
similar laws exist in some states 

table of contents we believe that our operations comply with applicable legal regulatory requirements of the anti kickback statute 
nevertheless  some of these laws have been applied to payments by physicians for marketing and referral services and could constrain our relationships  including financial and marketing relationships with customers such as hospitals 
absent specific guidance from the oig  our regulatory compliance can not be prospectively confirmed 
it also is possible that additional or more restrictive laws  regulations or guidelines could be adopted in the future 
criminal provisions prohibit knowingly filing false claims or making false statements or causing false statements to be made by others  and civil provisions prohibit the filing of claims or causing the filing of claims that one knows were false 
criminal penalties include fines and imprisonment 
civil penalties under the federal false claims act fca include fines of up to  per claim plus treble damages  for each filed claim 
although we are not filing claims ourselves  liability under the fca can extend to those who cause claims to be filed 
in addition  under the deficit reduction act of  states are encouraged to enact their own false claims laws  which could increase the number of false claims suits at the state level 
to the extent that consulting advice provided to our customers could be construed as aiding or abetting the presentation of false claims by the customers  we could be subject to false claims liability 
the internet is subject to many legal uncertainties and potential government laws and regulations that may decrease usage of our website  increase our cost of doing business or otherwise have a damaging effect on our business 
laws and regulations in jurisdictions throughout the world have been adopted and will likely continue to be adopted in the future that address internet  data and privacy related issues  including online content  user privacy  pricing  and quality of products and services 
this legislation and related enforcement activities could increase our cost of doing business and negatively affect our business 
moreover  it may take many more years to determine the extent to which laws and regulations passed prior to the popular use of the internet govern issues like property ownership  libel  negligence and personal privacy are applicable to the internet 
currently  us privacy law consists of disparate state and federal statutes regulating specific industries that collect personal data 
most of these laws predate and therefore do not specifically address online activities and information 
in addition  a number of comprehensive legislative and regulatory privacy proposals are now under consideration by federal  state and local governments in the united states 
laws and regulations in countries outside the united states restrict the availability of new markets in other countries where those markets would otherwise be available for expansion 
moreover  restrictive privacy and other laws outside the united states serve as a model for new and more restrictive laws inside the united states at both the federal and the state levels 
any new law or regulation pertaining to the internet  or the application or interpretation of existing laws  could decrease usage for our website  increase our cost of doing business or otherwise cause our business to suffer 
our business could be impaired by state and federal laws designed to protect individual health information 
if we fail to comply with current or future laws or regulations governing the collection  dissemination  use and confidentiality of patient health information  our business could suffer 
consumers sometimes enter private information about themselves or their family members when using our services

table of contents while we are not gathering patient health information at this time and we are not a covered entity under hipaa  other third party websites that consumers access through our website and employees  payers and other customers may not maintain systems to safeguard any health information they may be collecting 
in some cases  we may place our content on computers that are under the physical control of others  which may increase the risk of an inappropriate disclosure of information 
for example  we contract out the hosting of our website to a third party 
in addition  future laws or changes in current laws may necessitate costly adaptations to our systems 
online security breaches could harm our business 
our security measures may not prevent security breaches 
substantial or ongoing security breaches on our system or other internet based systems could reduce user confidence in our website  causing reduced usage that adversely affects our business 
the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is essential to maintain confidence in our websites 
we believe that consumers generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet  and any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth of our provision of healthcare information on the internet 
we will need to incur significant expense to protect and remedy against security breaches when we identify a significant business risk 
currently  we do not store sensitive information  such as patient information or credit card information  on our websites 
if we launch services that require us to gather sensitive information  our security expenditures will increase significantly 
a party that is able to circumvent our security systems could steal proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
security breaches could also damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our insurance policies may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches 
we also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties conducting business over the internet or customers and others who license our data 
other risks our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include anti takeover provisions that may deter or prevent a change of control 
some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of delaware law may deter or prevent a takeover attempt  including an attempt that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation requires the vote of of the outstanding voting securities in order to effect certain actions  including a sale of substantially all of our assets  certain mergers and consolidations and our dissolution or liquidation  unless these actions have been approved by a majority of the directors 
our certificate of incorporation also authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock having such rights as may be designated by our board of directors  without stockholder approval 
our bylaws provide that stockholders must follow an advance notification procedure for certain nominations of candidates for the board of directors and for certain other stockholder business to be conducted at a stockholders meeting 
the general corporation law of delaware also restricts certain business combinations with interested stockholders upon their acquisition of or more of our common stock 
all of these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire  control of us  and thereby could prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares 
in addition  the foregoing provisions could impair the ability of existing stockholders to remove and replace our management and or our board of directors 
we have no intention to pay dividends on our common stock 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock

item legal proceedings indemnification of our chief executive officer and derivative complaint for the year ended december   we provided indemnification to our chief executive officer  kerry r 
hicks  for legal fees totaling approximately  the legal proceedings arose from loans that mr 
hicks and three other executive officers provided to us in december in the amount of  including  individually loaned by mr 
hicks 
these loans enabled us to purchase in december a minority interest in an internet healthcare rating business that has become our current healthcare provider rating and advisory services business 
this purchase was critical to our business because we had agreed with the minority interest holder that if we failed to purchase the holder s interest by december   we would relinquish control and majority ownership to the holder 
in march  the executive officers converted our obligations to them including the  owed to mr 
hicks into our equity securities in order to induce several private investors to invest an aggregate of  in our equity securities 
the executive officers personally borrowed money from our principal lending bank in order to fund the december loans to us 
in early  the bank claimed that mr 
hicks was obligated to pay amounts owed to the bank by a former executive officer who was unable to fully repay his loan  mr 
hicks denied this obligation 
in october  the bank sold the note to an affiliate of a collection agency the collection agency and the affiliate are collectively referred to as the collection agency

hicks was not obligated under the former executive s promissory note issued to the bank  the collection agency commenced litigation in september in federal court in tennessee to collect the remaining balance of approximately  on the note and named mr 
hicks as a defendant 
on motion by mr 
hicks  the court action was stayed  and mr 
hicks commenced an arbitration proceeding against the collection agency in october  seeking an order that he had no liability under the note and asserting claims for damages 
the bank was added as a party in march the bank repurchased the note from the collection agency in december and resold the note to another third party in february  so that mr 
hicks obligation to repay the note was no longer at issue 
the remaining claims included  among others  claims by the bank against mr 
hicks for costs and expenses of collection of the loan  claims by the collection agency against mr 
hicks for abuse of process and tortious interference with the relationship between the bank and the collection agency and claims by mr 
hicks against the bank for breach of fiduciary duty and fraud  and against the collection agency for abuse of process and defamation 
mr 
hicks also commenced litigation in colorado state court against the other parties  as well as two individuals affiliated with the collection agency together with the collection agency  the collection agency parties  based on similar claims 
that case was removed to federal court by the defendants 
mr 
hicks later filed an amended complaint against the collection agency parties in federal district court for abuse of process  defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress 
the federal district court determined that mr 
hicks claims should be submitted to the arbitration proceeding  but in january  the arbitrator stayed mr 
hicks federal court claims and the collection agency s claims against mr 
hicks for abuse of process and tortious interference until the other pending claims were considered 
an arbitration hearing was held in february on the other claims submitted by the parties 
in april  the arbitrator ruled that the collection agency was liable to mr 
hicks in the amount of  for emotional distress and other maladies as well as attorneys fees in the amount of  with interest as a result of the collection agency s abuse of process in initiating the action in federal court in tennessee 
the arbitrator determined that the bank had no liability

mr

hicks 
in february  the th circuit court of appeals affirmed the district court s confirmation of the april award entered in favor of mr 
hicks 
this award has not been paid to mr 
hicks 
the hearing on the remaining matters in the arbitration was held in february and march the arbitrator who heard these claims died unexpectedly a few days after the arbitration hearing concluded 
a new arbitrator was appointed  and the remaining matters were again heard by the new arbitrator in october final briefings on the remaining matters in the arbitration were concluded in april on may   the arbitrator entered an award in favor of mr 
hicks in connection with his claims of defamation and outrageous conduct

the award entered on may   if not promptly paid  will be subject to confirmation by the us district court 
on june   mr 
hicks filed his motion to confirm the arbitration award 
the collection agency parties have filed their opposition and filed a motion to vacate the award 
briefing on the motions is complete 
we do not know whether the collection agency parties will appeal or otherwise contest the awards  what other actions the collection agency parties may take  when mr 
hicks will be paid the awards  or when we may receive reimbursement for any or all of the indemnification expenses we have incurred and continue to incur in these matters 
on july   mr 
hicks filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint and to refer claims to arbitration in which he alleged that certain of the collection agency parties  after the october arbitration hearing  continued to engage in conduct substantially similar to that upon which the arbitrator entered his compensatory and punitive damages order on may  the collection agency parties opposed the relief sought by mr 
hicks 
those claims have been referred to arbitration 
on october   the court granted mr 
hicks motion for leave to file a second amended complaint 
a supplemental complaint asserting claims for defamation and outrageous conduct against certain of the collection agency parties was filed on october   in accordance with the court s order 
the claims mr 
hicks asserts in the arbitration are for defamation and outrageous conduct against the collection agency parties 
mr 
hicks has filed motions to attempt to narrow the issues to be heard based upon the findings made by the arbitrator in his may   ruling 
the collection agency parties have raised claims against mr 
hicks for abuse of process  frivolous and spurious lawsuit and attorneys fees 
mr 
hicks filed a motion to dismiss the counterclaims 
briefing on that motion was completed on january  the hearing in connection with mr 
hicks claims  and any counterclaims that survive the motion to dismiss  is set to commence on june  our board of directors initially agreed to indemnify mr 
hicks in december the determination to indemnify mr 
hicks was based on  among other things  the fact that the dispute related to mr 
hicks efforts and personal financial commitment to provide funds to us in december  without which we likely would not have remained viable 
mr 
hicks has advised us that he intends to reimburse us for all indemnification expenses we have incurred and continue to incur  from the proceeds of any final awards paid to him  net of any income taxes payable by him resulting from the awards 
by a letter to our board of directors dated february   daniel c 
cadle  one of the collection agency parties  made allegations directed at us  mr 
hicks and the attorneys representing mr 
hicks in the arbitration and the late arbitrator 
the principal allegations appear to be that we  mr 
hicks  and the attorneys conspired to enter into an illegal arrangement with an account officer of the bank whose loan was the initial subject of the arbitration  without the bank s knowledge  that enabled us to indirectly obtain funds from the bank and  in conspiracy with the late arbitrator  prevented the collection agency parties from reporting the alleged conduct to government authorities 
mr 
cadle threatened suit if he was not paid million 
we believe these allegations are absurd and completely without merit 
to our knowledge  neither mr 
cadle  nor any of the other collection agency parties  has sought to assert any such claims against us in the arbitration 
we will vigorously contest any such litigation that may be brought against us by the collection agency parties 
in addition  in september and october  our board of directors and our counsel received communications from counsel to daniel c 
cadle demanding a review of the indemnification payments made by us on mr 
hicks behalf and raising certain other issues 
on december   daniel c 
cadle filed a putative shareholder derivative complaint in the us district court for the district of colorado against several of our current and former members of our board of directors  mr 
hicks and our chief financial officer collectively  the defendants 
mr 
cadle alleged  among other items  that the defendants wasted and continue to waste corporate assets and opportunities by permitting the indemnification described above  that mr 
hicks had converted assets properly belonging to us and our stockholders to his own use and benefit by accepting the indemnification payments and that the defendants violated colorado and delaware state and federal law by concealing material information or making materially misleading statements in our quarterly and annual financial reports regarding these matters 
mr 
cadle seeks a recovery to our company of the attorney s fees paid to indemnify mr 
hicks  participatory damages to himself personally as well as any attorneys fees he incurs in this matter 
mr 
cadle also seeks injunctive relief to prevent us from continuing to indemnify mr 
hicks 
in april  the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the shareholder derivative complaint 
the plaintiff filed a reply to this motion in may the defendants motion to dismiss the shareholder derivative complaint was granted by the us district court in june the plaintiff has appealed the dismissal of the complaint to the th circuit court of appeals 

table of contents on july   a us district court judge entered an order precluding daniel c 
cadle from engaging in acts that the arbitrator found to be outrageous 
on july   a county court judge in jefferson county  colorado  entered a permanent civil protection order against daniel c 
cadle 
the protection order requires that mr

cadle appealed the civil protection order entered by the county court judge in jefferson county  colorado  to the us district court 
on january   the us district court affirmed the civil protection order entered by the county court 
in june  we filed a motion to recover attorneys fees totaling approximately  incurred with respect to the shareholder derivative complaint by mr 
cadle 
on july   the trial court entered an order deferring resolution of the motion for attorneys fees until after the th circuit court of appeals decides the appeal of the trial court s order dismissing the complaint 
following receipt of the letters from counsel to daniel c 
cadle in september and october  our board of directors appointed a special committee comprised of independent directors of the board to consider the matters raised 
in september  our board of directors approved the recommendation of the special committee to reconfirm the board s prior determination that indemnification of mr

gotham primarius complaint on march   gotham holdings  lp  primarius partners lp  primarius offshore partners ltd  primarius focus lp and primarius china fund lp collectively  the plaintiffs commenced an action in the united states district court  southern district of new york against us  mdb capital group mdb and essex woodlands health ventures essex 
the case relates to sales made by essex in december and february of approximately million shares of our common stock  to a number of investors  including the plaintiffs 
these sales occurred under a registration statement that we initially filed with the securities and exchange commission on may  essex engaged a broker  mdb  in connection with the sales 
we did not receive any proceeds from these sales 
the plaintiffs allege claims under section b of the exchange act and rule b  section of the securities act  fraud with respect to alleged material misrepresentations and or omissions of material fact and negligent misrepresentation in connection with the plaintiffs purchase of our common stock 
as they relate to us  the claims arise out of our sec filings and presentations made by company management at the request of essex  to plaintiffs or parties allegedly related to the plaintiffs in december and february specifically  the claims relate to alleged misrepresentations by company management regarding the likelihood that the hewitt agreement would move to full implementation 
on july   we filed a motion to dismiss the gotham primarius complaint 
the plaintiffs responded by filing a first amended complaint on august  in the first amended complaint  the plaintiffs asserted the same four claims against us that they had made in the original complaint  and three new entities were added as plaintiffs willow creek capital partners  lp  willow creek capital partners ii  lp  and willow creek offshore  ltd we filed a motion to dismiss the first amended complaint on september  by order dated october   the court granted our motion to dismiss the first amended complaint  with leave given to the plaintiffs to file a second amended complaint 
on october   the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint against us  which contained allegations that were substantially similar to those pled in the first amended complaint 
we filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on december  the court conducted oral argument on the motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on january  at which time it denied our motion to dismiss the common law fraud and section b claims  but deferred a decision on the section and negligent misrepresentation claims 
on february   the court issued an opinion dismissing the section claim  but maintaining the negligent misrepresentation claim because dismissal at that time was premature 
we will have an opportunity to renew our argument once the court decides which state s law applies 
we believe the claims against us are without merit and we intend to continue to vigorously defend this matter 
we are subject to other legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
in the opinion of management  these actions are unlikely to materially affect our financial position

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in evaluating our financial results and financial condition  management has focused principally on the following revenue growth and client retention we believe revenue growth and client retention are key factors affecting both our results of operations and our cash flow from operations 
for the year ended december   our increased revenues as compared to the same period of reflected our success in several product areas 
we continued adding new hospital customers to our strategic quality partnership sqp  strategic quality initiative sqi and clinical excellence research consulting group qa and qai programs 
in addition  during the year ended december  we continued to generate revenue from our first contract with a hospital system tenet healthsystem for our internet patient acquisition program  which we signed in april for the year ended december   we continued to increase our efforts to deploy of an advertising sponsorship platform including recommendations on design of the website to optimize ad placement and identification of an ad server partner  among other things 
as our base of hospital clients grows  one of our principal objectives is to achieve a high rate of retention of these clients 
we typically receive a non refundable payment for the first year of the contract term  which is typically three years  subject to a cancellation right that may be exercised by either the client or us on each annual anniversary date of contract execution 
in an effort to increase retention rates  we have begun to execute three year contracts with no right of cancellation until the second anniversary 
currently these two year fixed agreements do not represent a significant number of our contracts with hospitals 
an obstacle to maintaining high retention rates for our sqp and sqi clients is that clients may have lost their high ratings on or before any given contract anniversary date 
in addition  for our contracts with hospitals that have also been awarded an overall hospital designation  such as our distinguished hospital award for clinical excellence  we have found that in many cases  the hospitals terminate their contract with us if they lose the overall hospital designation 
for example  hospitals that contract with us for the sqp program typically have been awarded our distinguished hospital award for clinical excellence 
in addition  the contracts give hospitals the ability to utilize any additional marketing messages they have for our individual service lines with us 
however  if the hospital does not achieve the distinguished hospital award for clinical excellence in each year of its agreement  it may not place as much value on the individual service line messages and  therefore  may terminate its agreement with us 
we have continued to enhance the services provided in our agreements as well as add service line awards that are designed to increase our ability to retain these clients 
for the year ended december   we retained  or signed new agreements with  hospitals representing approximately of the annual contract value of hospitals whose contracts had first or second year anniversary dates 
in general  our rate of re signing expired contracts is lower  especially with respect to our quality improvement clients  than our retention rate with respect to contracts that have a cancellation option on the first or second anniversary dates 
some of our quality improvement clients view a three year term as the culmination of their improvement efforts rather than a starting point 
the increase in our contract prices over the last several years has caused some hospitals to decline renewal as well 
because we give our clients a fixed annual contract price during their three year term  our price points for renewals may have increased significantly since the beginning of the contract 
we typically receive a non refundable payment for the first year of the contract term which is typically a maximum of three years  subject to a cancellation right that may be exercised by either the client or us on each annual anniversary date  with certain exceptions upon contract execution 
because we typically receive payment in advance for each year of the term of these agreements  if we cannot continue to attract new hospital clients and retain a significant portion of our current clients  our cash flow from operations could be adversely affected 
critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that  among other things  affect the reported amounts of assets  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are most significant where they involve levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or matters susceptible to change  and where they can have a material impact on our financial condition and operating performance 
we discuss below the most significant estimates and related assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements  specifically those relating to our stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating expected volatility 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 

table of contents if actual results were to differ significantly from the estimates made  the reported results could be materially affected 
compensation cost we recognized under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r is recorded in the respective income statement categories based on the offered employees eg sales and marketing  product development 
revenue and expense components the following descriptions of the components of revenues and expenses apply to the comparison of results of operations 
ratings and advisory revenue 
we currently operate in one business segment

we generate revenue by providing our clients with information and other assistance that enable them to measure  assess  enhance and market healthcare quality 
our target clients include hospitals  employers  benefits consulting firms  payers  insurance companies and consumers 
we typically receive a non refundable payment at the beginning of each year of the contract term which is typically three years  subject to a cancellation right by either the client or us  on each annual anniversary date  with certain exceptions 
we record the cash payment as deferred revenue that is then amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over the respective year of the term 
certain of our products represent a one time delivery of data 
for these arrangements  we recognize revenue at the time that the data is delivered 
cost of ratings and advisory revenue 
cost of ratings and advisory revenue consists primarily of the costs associated with the delivery of services related to our sqi  sqp and qai programs  as well as the costs incurred to acquire the data utilized in connection with these and other services such as our health management suite of products 
the cost of delivery of services relates primarily to the client consultants and support staff that provide our services 
sales and marketing costs 
sales and marketing costs include salaries  wages and commission expenses related to our sales efforts  as well as other direct sales and marketing costs 
for our sqp  sqi and qai agreements  we pay our sales personnel commissions as we receive payment from our hospital clients 
we typically receive a non refundable payment for the first year and subsequent years on each anniversary date of the three year contract term 
in addition  we record the commission expense in the period it is earned  which is typically upon contract execution for the first year of the agreement and on each anniversary date for clients that do not cancel in the second or third year of the contract term 
we record the commission expense in this manner because once a contract is signed  the salesperson has no remaining obligations to perform during the agreement in order to earn the commission 
product development costs 
we incur product development costs related to the development and support of our website and the development of applications to support data compilation and extraction for our consulting services 
these costs are expensed as incurred unless the criteria for capitalization under american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use sop are met 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  employee benefits and other expenses for employees that support our infrastructure such as finance and accounting personnel  certain information technology employees and some of our support staff  facility costs  legal  accounting and other professional fees and insurance costs

internet business group

these increases were partially offset by a slight decrease in sales of quality reports to consumers as we continue to make information free to them 
in  the majority of our advertising revenue came from advertisements placed through the google adsense platform 
during the second half of  we began to place advertisements on our website and signed our first test advertising campaign with a pharmaceutical company 
in addition  we implemented doubleclick as our ad serving engine at the end of december

strategic health solutions 
for the year ended december   strategic health solutions revenue  which includes sales of our quality information to employers  benefit consultants  health plans and others and any sales of our data  was approximately million  a decrease of million  or from the year ended december  contributing to this decrease is the fact that the sales cycle for the sales of our quality information to employers  benefit consultants  health plans and others is very lengthy

for the year ended december   strategic health solutions revenue  which includes sales of our quality information to employers  benefit consultants  health plans and others and any sales of our data  was approximately million  a decrease of million  or over the year ended december  contributing to this decrease was the fact that we received million from a pilot program with hewitt in the second half of  and did not receive any revenue under this program in in addition  the sales cycle for the sales of our quality information to employers  benefit consultants  health plans and others is very lengthy 
in some cases  the time from initial contact to sales close can be as much as a year or more 
cost of ratings and advisory revenue 
for the years ended december  and  cost of ratings and advisory revenue was approximately million and million  respectively  or approximately and of ratings and advisory revenue 
the increase in cost of ratings and advisory revenue as a percentage of ratings and advisory revenue is due in part to the slight increase in incremental cost associated with increased sales of our marketing services to hospitals and sales of quality information 
in addition  one of the significant components of cost of ratings and advisory revenue is our cost to acquire data  which has also increased slightly as a percentage of ratings and advisory revenue over included in cost of ratings and advisory revenue in is approximately  of compensation costs from our adoption of sfas r during sales and marketing costs 
sales and marketing costs for the year ended december  increased to approximately million from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of ratings and advisory revenue  sales and marketing costs were and  in and  respectively 
the increase as a percentage of ratings and advisory revenue is primarily due to the hiring of additional sales personnel in as well as a large volume of new sales 
we pay a higher percentage of commissions to our sales group with respect to new contracts than we pay upon retention of contracts 
revenue is deferred and we recognize revenue on a straight line basis  while commission is expensed upon contract execution 
therefore  commission expenses can rise very quickly in periods of increased sales 
in addition  our sales team is incentivized on a tiered commission structure 
the more seasoned sales personnel accounted for the majority of the sales later in  and sales commissions were paid to these individuals based on the highest commission tiers 
sales and marketing costs also include payments to internet search engines for placement on the internet 
this expense was approximately million and  in and  respectively 
the increase costs are mainly because ad placements are more frequently displayed through our search engine partners due to increased search traffic 
finally  included in sales and marketing costs in is approximately  of compensation costs from our adoption of sfas r during product development costs 
product development costs for the year ended december  increased to approximately million from million for the year ended december  this increase is principally due to additional personnel hired to support our product development efforts  including both the improvement of existing products as well as the development of new product offerings 
in addition  we continued to invest in the improvement of our physician data 
the physician data we maintained at december  relates to over  physicians 
this data does not identify physicians by a unique physician identifier such as a social security number for an individual 
therefore  in order to properly match the various data points that we maintain to the appropriate physician  we must conduct a robust matching process 
we continue to acquire new physician data and refine our matching process to improve the accuracy of our data 
in addition  included in product development costs in is approximately  of compensation costs from our adoption of sfas r during general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses were approximately million  an increase of approximately million from general and administrative expenses of approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses is due to various items including an increase in legal fees of approximately  which relates primarily to indemnification expenses for our chief executive officer described in note to the financial statements included in item of this report and the fees we are incurring with respect to the arbitration claims against hewitt also described in note to the financial statements included in item of this report  additional personnel in the accounting finance area and general it support of approximately  increased depreciation related to additional hardware infrastructure purchases in of approximately  and additional accounting fees of approximately  related principally to an outside consulting firm retained to assist us with respect to our sarbanes oxley section compliance efforts

this standby letter of credit is secured by the cash and cash equivalents we maintain with silicon valley bank 
we currently have no other credit arrangements

we also record restricted stock awards rsas as common stock issued and outstanding upon grant of the award 
during the restriction period  a grantee may not sell  assign  transfer  pledge or otherwise dispose of the award  but has the right to vote and receive any dividends or other distributions paid on such shares

as the controlling  majority owner  the  fair value assigned to the trademark is recorded at our carrying value  or see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
we anticipate that we have sufficient funds available to support ongoing operations at their current level 
as noted above  upon execution of our sqi  sqp and qai agreements  we typically receive a non refundable payment for the first year of the contract term which is typically three years  subject to a cancellation right that may be exercised by either the client or us on each annual anniversary date  with certain exceptions 
we record the cash payment as deferred revenue  which is a current liability on our balance sheet that is then amortized to revenue on a straight line basis over the first year of the term 
annual renewal payments  which are made in advance of the year to which the payment relates  are treated in the same manner during each of the following two years 
as a result  our operating cash flow is substantially dependent upon our ability to continue to sign new agreements  and to continue to maintain a high rate of client retention 
our current operating plan includes growth in new sales from these agreements 
a significant failure to achieve sales targets in the plan would have a material negative impact on our financial position and cash flow

sfas  fair value measurement 
this new standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the fasb believes the standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
the provisions of sfas are to be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which sfas is initially applied 
only under certain circumstances is sfas to be applied retrospectively  in which case a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings is required for the difference between the carrying amounts and the fair values of those financial instruments at the date sfas is initially applied 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the application of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  to provide guidance on how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits 
the fasb clarifies in this fsp that a tax position could be effectively settled upon examination by a taxing authority 
assessing whether a tax position is effectively settled is a matter of judgment because examinations occur in a variety of ways 
in determining whether a tax position is effectively settled  companies should make the assessment on a position by position basis  but a company could conclude that all positions in a particular tax year are effectively settled
