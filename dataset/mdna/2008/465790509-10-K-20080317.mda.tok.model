item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report 
government regulations in foreign countries may limit our activities and harm our business operations 
we carry on business in china and we may  in the future  carry on business in other foreign jurisdictions with governments  governmental agencies or government owned entities 
the foreign legal framework for the agreements through which we carry on business now or in the future  particularly in developing countries  is often based on recent political and economic reforms and newly enacted legislation  which may not be consistent with long standing local conventions and customs 
as a result  there may be ambiguities  inconsistencies and anomalies in the agreements or the legislation upon which they are based which are atypical of more developed legal systems and which may affect the interpretation and enforcement of our rights and obligations and those of our foreign partners 
local institutions and bureaucracies responsible for administering foreign laws may lack a proper understanding of the laws or the experience necessary to apply them in a modern business context 
foreign laws may be applied in an inconsistent  arbitrary and unfair manner and legal remedies may be uncertain  delayed or unavailable 
estimates of proved reserves and future net revenue may change if the assumptions on which such estimates are based prove to be inaccurate 
our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment and the assumptions used regarding prices for oil and natural gas  production volumes  required levels of operating and capital expenditures  and quantities of recoverable oil reserves 
oil prices have fluctuated widely in recent years 
volatility is expected to continue and price fluctuations directly affect estimated quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues 
actual prices  production  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil reserves will vary from those assumed in our estimates  and these variances may be significant 
also  we make certain assumptions regarding future oil prices  production levels  and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect 
any significant variance from the assumptions used could result in the actual quantity of our reserves and future net cash flow being materially different from the estimates we report 
in addition  actual results of drilling  testing and production and changes in natural gas and oil prices after the date of the estimate may result in revisions to our reserve estimates 
revisions to prior estimates may be material 
information in this document regarding our future plans reflects our current intent and is subject to change 
we describe our current exploration and development plans in this annual report 
whether we ultimately implement our plans will depend on availability and cost of capital  receipt of htl tm technology process test results  additional seismic data or reprocessed existing data  current and projected oil or gas prices  costs and availability of drilling rigs and other equipment  supplies and personnel  success or failure of activities in similar areas  changes in estimates of project completion costs  our ability to attract other industry partners to acquire a portion of the working interest to reduce costs and exposure to risks and decisions of our joint working interest owners 
we will continue to gather data about our projects and it is possible that additional information will cause us to alter our schedule or determine that a project should not be pursued at all 
you should understand that our plans regarding our projects might change 
our business may be harmed if we are unable to retain our interests in licenses  leases and production sharing contracts 
some of our properties are held under licenses and leases  working interests in licenses and leases or production sharing contracts 
if we fail to meet the specific requirements of the instrument through which we hold our interest  it may terminate or expire 
we cannot assure you that any or all of the obligations required to maintain our interest in each such license  lease or production sharing contract will be met 
some of our property interests will terminate unless we fulfill such obligations 
if we are unable to satisfy these obligations on a timely basis  we may lose our rights in these properties 
the termination of our interests in these properties may harm our business 
we may incur significant costs on exploration or development efforts which may prove unsuccessful or unprofitable 
there can be no assurance that the costs we incur on exploration or development will result in an economic return 
we may misinterpret geologic or engineering data  which may result in significant losses on unsuccessful exploration or development drilling efforts 
we bear the risks of project delays and cost overruns due to unexpected geologic conditions  equipment failures  equipment delivery delays  accidents  adverse weather  government and joint venture partner approval delays  construction or start up delays and other associated risks 
such risks may delay expected production and or increase costs of production or otherwise adversely affect our ability to realize an acceptable level of economic return on a particular project in a timely manner or at all 
our business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses  insurance may not protect us against all these risks 
there are hazards and risks inherent in drilling for  producing and transporting oil 
these hazards and risks may result in loss of hydrocarbons  environmental pollution  personal injury claims  and other damage to our properties and third parties and include fires  natural disasters  adverse weather conditions  explosions  encountering formations with abnormal pressures  encountering unusual or unexpected geological formations  blowouts  cratering  unexpected operational events  equipment malfunctions  pipeline ruptures  spills  compliance with environmental and government regulations and title problems 
we are insured against some  but not all  of the hazards associated with our business  so we may sustain losses that could be substantial due to events that are not insured or are underinsured 
the occurrence of an event that is not covered or not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not carry business interruption insurance and  therefore  the loss and delay of revenues resulting from curtailed production are not insured 
complying with environmental and other government regulations could be costly and could negatively impact our production 
our operations are governed by numerous laws and regulations at various levels of government in the countries in which we operate 
these laws and regulations govern the operation and maintenance of our facilities  the discharge of materials into the environment and other environmental protection issues and may  among other potential consequences  require that we acquire permits before commencing drilling  restrict the substances that can be released into the environment with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on protected areas such as wetlands or wilderness areas  require that reclamation measures be taken to prevent pollution from former operations  require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations  such as plugging abandoned wells and remediating contaminated soil and groundwater and require remedial measures be taken with respect to property designated as a contaminated site 
under these laws and regulations  we could be liable for personal injury  clean up costs and other environmental and property damages  as well as administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
we maintain limited insurance coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages as well as environmental damage that occurs over time 
however  we do not believe that insurance coverage for the full potential liability of environmental damages is available at a reasonable cost 
accordingly  we could be liable  or could be required to cease production on properties  if environmental damage occurs 
the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations in the future may harm our business 
furthermore  future changes in environmental laws and regulations could occur that result in stricter standards and enforcement  larger fines and liability  and increased capital expenditures and operating costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we compete for oil and gas properties with many other exploration and development companies throughout the world who have access to greater resources 
we operate in a highly competitive environment in which we compete with other exploration and development companies to acquire a limited number of prospective oil and gas properties 
many of our competitors are much larger than we are and  as a result  may enjoy a competitive advantage in accessing financial  technical and human resources 
they may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects and to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial  technical and human resources permit 
our share ownership is highly concentrated and  as a result  our principal shareholder significantly influences our business 
as at the date of this annual report  our largest shareholder  robert m 
friedland  owned approximately of our common shares 
as a result  he has the voting power to significantly influence our policies  business and affairs and the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter  including mergers  consolidations and the sale of all  or substantially all  of our assets 
in addition  the concentration of our ownership may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control that otherwise could result in a premium in the price of our common shares 
if we lose our key management and technical personnel  our business may suffer 
we rely upon a relatively small group of key management personnel 
given the technological nature of our business  we also rely heavily upon our scientific and technical personnel 
our ability to implement our business strategy may be constrained and the timing of implementation may be impacted if we are unable to attract and retain sufficient personnel 
we do not maintain any key man insurance 
we do not have employment agreements with certain of our key management and technical personnel and we cannot assure you that these individuals will remain with us in the future 
an unexpected partial or total loss of their services would harm our business

exemptions from certain nasdaq marketplace rules nasdaq s marketplace rules permit foreign private issuers to follow home country practices in lieu of the requirements of certain marketplace rules  including the requirement that a majority of an issuer s board of directors be comprised of independent directors determined on the basis of prescribed independence criteria and the requirement that an issuer s independent directors have regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present 
applicable canadian rules pertaining to corporate governance require us to disclose in our management proxy circular  on an annual basis  our corporate governance practices  including whether or not a majority of our board of directors is comprised of independent directors  based on prescribed independence criteria  which differ slightly from the criteria prescribed in the nasdaq marketplace rules and whether or not our independent directors hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present 
although applicable canadian rules pertaining to corporate governance make reference  as part of a series of non prescriptive corporate governance guidelines based on what are perceived to be best practices  to the desirability of a board comprised of a majority of independent directors  and independent directors holding regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present  there is no legal requirement in canada that mandates a board comprised of a majority of independent directors or that independent directors hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  our board of directors consists of individuals who are independent and individuals who are not independent  applying the criteria prescribed by applicable canadian rules pertaining to corporate governance and the criteria prescribed by the nasdaq marketplace rules 
our independent directors are a

effective as of the date of our next annual general meeting of shareholders agm scheduled to be held on may   we plan to reduce the size of our board of directors from directors to directors by nominating only individuals for election as directors at the agm 
see item directors  executive officers and corporate governance 
if all of the individuals we plan to nominate for election at the agm are elected as directors  our board of directors will then consist of individuals who are independent and individuals who are not independent  applying the criteria prescribed by applicable canadian rules pertaining to corporate governance and the criteria prescribed by the nasdaq marketplace rules 
our non management directors hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only non management directors are present but of our non management directors are not independent  applying the criteria prescribed by applicable canadian rules pertaining to corporate governance and the criteria prescribed by the nasdaq marketplace rules 
if all of the individuals we plan to nominate for election at the agm are elected as directors  one of our non management directors will not be independent enforceability of civil liabilities we are a company incorporated under the laws of the yukon territory of canada and our executive offices are located in british columbia  canada 
some of our directors  controlling shareholders  officers and representatives of the experts named in this annual report on form k reside outside the us and a substantial portion of their assets and our assets are located outside the us as a result  it may be difficult for you to effect service of process within the us upon the directors  controlling shareholders  officers and representatives of experts who are not residents of the us or to enforce against them judgments obtained in the courts of the us based upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws or other laws of the us there is doubt as to the enforceability in canada against us or against any of our directors  controlling shareholders  officers or experts who are not residents of the us  in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of us courts  of liabilities based solely upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 
therefore  it may not be possible to enforce those actions against us  our directors  officers  controlling shareholders or experts named in this annual report on form k 
holders of common shares as at december   a total of  of our common shares were issued and outstanding and held by holders of record with an estimated  additional shareholders whose shares were held for them in street name or nominee accounts 
dividends we have not paid any dividends on our outstanding common shares since we were incorporated and we do not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future 
the declaration of dividends on our common shares is  subject to certain statutory restrictions described below  within the discretion of our board of directors based on their assessment of  among other factors  our earnings or lack thereof  our capital and operating expenditure requirements and our overall financial condition 
under the yukon business corporations act  our board of directors has no discretion to declare or pay a dividend on our common shares if they have reasonable grounds for believing that we are  or after payment of the dividend would be  unable to pay our liabilities as they become due or that the realizable value of our assets would  as a result of the dividend  be less than the aggregate sum of our liabilities and the stated capital of our common shares 
exchange controls and taxation there is no law or governmental decree or regulation in canada that restricts the export or import of capital  or affects the remittance of dividends  interest or other payments to a non resident holder of our common shares  other than withholding tax requirements 
there is no limitation imposed by the laws of canada  the laws of the yukon territory  or our constating documents on the right of a non resident to hold or vote our common shares  other than as provided in the investment canada act canada the investment act  which generally prohibits a reviewable investment by an entity that is not a canadian  as defined  unless after review  the minister responsible for the investment act is satisfied that the investment is likely to be of net benefit to canada 
an investment in our common shares by a non canadian who is not a wto investor which includes governments of  or individuals who are nationals of  member states of the world trade organization and corporations and other entities which are controlled by them  at a time when we were not already controlled by a wto investor  would be reviewable under the investment act under two circumstances 
first  if it was an investment to acquire control within the meaning of the investment act and the value of our assets  as determined under investment act regulations  was cdn 
million or more 
second  the investment would also be reviewable if an order for review was made by the federal cabinet of the canadian government on the grounds that the investment related to canada s cultural heritage or national identity as prescribed under the investment act  regardless of asset value 
an investment in our common shares by a wto investor  or by a non canadian at a time when we were already controlled by a wto investor  would be reviewable under the investment act if it was an investment to acquire control and the value of our assets  as determined under investment act regulations  was not less than a specified amount  which for is cdn 
million 
the investment act provides detailed rules to determine if there has been an acquisition of control 
for example  a non canadian would acquire control of us for the purposes of the investment act if the non canadian acquired a majority of our outstanding common shares 
the acquisition of less than a majority  but one third or more  of our common shares would be presumed to be an acquisition of control of us unless it could be established that  on the acquisition  we were not controlled in fact by the acquirer 
an acquisition of control for the purposes of the investment act could also occur as a result of the acquisition by a non canadian of all or substantially all of our assets 
amounts that we may  in the future  pay or credit  or be deemed to have paid or credited  to you as dividends in respect of the common shares you hold at a time when you are not a resident of canada within the meaning of the income tax act canada will generally be subject to canadian non resident withholding tax of of the amount paid or credited  which may be reduced under the canada us income tax convention  as amended  the convention 
currently  under the convention  the rate of canadian non resident withholding tax on the gross amount of dividends paid or credited to a us resident is generally 
however  if the beneficial owner of such dividends is a us resident corporation  which owns or more of our voting stock  the withholding rate is reduced to 
in the case of certain tax exempt entities  which are residents of the us for the purpose of the convention  the withholding tax on dividends may be reduced to

ivanhoe energy s business ivanhoe energy is an independent international heavy oil development and production company focused on pursuing long term growth in its reserve base and production 
ivanhoe energy plans to utilize technologically innovative methods designed to significantly improve recovery of heavy oil resources  including the application of the patented rapid thermal processing process rtp tm process for heavy oil upgrading htl tm technology or htl tm and enhanced oil recovery eor techniques 
in addition  the company seeks to expand its reserve base and production through conventional exploration and production e p of oil and gas 
finally  the company is exploring an opportunity to monetize stranded gas reserves through the application of the conversion of natural gas to liquids using a technology gtl technology or gtl licensed from syntroleum corporation 
our core operations are in the united states and china  with business development opportunities worldwide 
ivanhoe energy s proprietary  patented heavy oil upgrading technology upgrades the quality of heavy oil and bitumen by producing lighter  more valuable crude oil  along with by product energy which can be used to generate steam or electricity 
the htl tm technology has the potential to substantially improve the economics and transportation of heavy oil 
there are significant quantities of heavy oil throughout the world that have not been developed  much of it stranded due to the lack of on site energy  transportation issues  or poor heavy light price differentials 
in remote parts of the world  the considerable reduction in viscosity of the heavy oil through the htl tm process will allow the oil to be transported economically over long distances 
in addition to a dramatic improvement in oil quality  an htl tm facility can yield large amounts of surplus energy for production of the steam and electricity used in heavy oil production 
the thermal energy from the htl tm process would provide heavy oil producers with an alternative to increasingly volatile prices for natural gas that now is widely used to generate steam 
yields of the low viscosity  upgraded product are greater than by volume  and high conversion of the heavy residual fraction is achieved 
in addition to the liquid upgraded oil product  a small amount of valuable by product gas is produced  and usable excess heat is generated from the by product coke 
htl tm can virtually eliminate cost exposure to natural gas and diluent  solve the transport challenge  and capture the majority of the heavy to light oil price differential for oil producers 
htl tm accomplishes this at a much smaller scale and at lower per barrel capital costs compared with established competing technologies  using readily available plant and process components 
as htl tm facilities are designed for installation near the wellhead  they eliminate the need for diluent and make large  dedicated upgrading facilities unnecessary 
executive overview of results during the year  the value attributed to our reserves of oil and gas based on a standardized measure of discounted future cash flows increased by to million of which million is in china and million in the us although these values increased principally as a result of significant year over year increases in oil prices  several other factors affected the company s oil and gas activities for the year 
higher oil prices were offset by reduced production volumes  principally as a result of down hole equipment issues in china and a lack of steaming equipment in the us both of these equipment issues have been resolved with a change in the supplier for certain equipment in china and the addition of a second steaming unit and the retrofit of an existing steaming unit in our california operation 
in addition  total revenues decreased as a result of a million increase in losses on derivative instruments that were required by the company s bank loan agreements 
general and administrative costs and business and technology expenses increased as the company continued to invest significant resources in the development and commercial deployment of its patented htl tm heavy oil upgrading technology 
the following table sets forth certain selected consolidated data for the past three years year ended december  oil and gas revenue net loss net loss per share average production boe d net operating revenue per boe cash flow from operating activities capital investments financial results year to year change in net loss the following provides a summary analysis of our net loss for each of the three years ended december  and a summary of year over year variances for the year ended december  compared to and for the year ended december  compared to favorable favorable unfavorable unfavorable variances variances summary of net loss by significant components oil and gas revenues production volumes oil and gas prices realized gain loss on derivative instruments operating costs general and administrative  less stock based compensation business and technology development  less stock based compensation acquisition costs net interest unrealized loss on derivative instruments depletion and depreciation stock based compensation write downs of htl tm and gtl development costs impairment of oil and gas properties other net loss our net loss for was million per share compared to our net loss in of million per share 
the increase in our net loss from to of million was due to decrease of million in combined oil and gas revenues and realized loss on derivative instruments  an increase in operating costs of million  a million increase in general and administrative and business and technology development expenses excluding stock based compensation and an million increase in unrealized loss on derivative instruments 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease for depletion and depreciation 
our net loss for was million per share compared to our net loss in of million per share 
the increase in our net loss from to of million was due mainly to an million increase in depletion and depreciation offset by an increase of million in oil and gas revenues offset by an million increase in operating costs and a million increase in general and administrative and business and technology development expenses excluding stock based compensation 
significant variances in our net losses are explained in the sections that follow 
revenues and operating costs the following is a comparison of changes in production volumes for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in and for the year ended december  when compared to the same period for years ended december  years ended december  net boe s percentage net boe s percentage change change china dagang daqing us south midway spraberry others net production volumes in decreased from due to a decrease in production volumes in our china properties and a decrease in our us properties  resulting in decreased revenues of million 
net production volumes in increased from due to an increase in production volumes in our china properties offset by a decrease in our us properties  resulting in increased revenues of million 
oil and gas prices increased per boe in generating million in additional revenue as compared to we realized an average of per boe from operations in china during  which was an increase of per boe from prices and accounted for million of our increase in revenues 
from the us operations  we realized an average of per boe during  which was an increase of per boe and accounted for million of our increased revenues 
we expect crude oil prices and natural gas prices to remain volatile in oil and gas prices increased per boe in generating million in additional revenue as compared to we realized an average of per boe from operations in china during  which was an increase of per boe from prices and accounted for million of our increase in revenues 
from the us operations  we realized an average of per boe during  which was an increase of per boe and accounted for million of our increased revenues 
the increased revenues from oil and gas price increases in were offset by settlements from our costless collar derivative instruments 
as benchmark prices rise above the ceiling price established in the contract the company is required to settle monthly see further details on these contracts below under unrealized loss on derivative instruments 
the company realized a net loss on these settlements in of million  million of which was from the us segment  the balance from the china segment 
this compares to a net gain in of million on us contracts 
operating costs  including production taxes and engineering and support costs  for increased  or  per boe  when compared to these costs increased  or  per boe  for when compared to operating costs in absolute terms for increased million when compared to and these costs increased million in when compared to china production volumes vs 
the december  exit production rate at dagang was  gross bopd  compared to  gross bopd at the end of normal field decline was offset by the production of gross bopd from five new development wells completed and put on production in the second half of overall  net production volumes decreased at the dagang field for as in addition to normal declines within the field  we incurred abnormal downtimes due to problems encountered with sub surface equipment 
we expect that these equipment issues have been resolved with a change in equipment suppliers 
we expect that additional perforations  fracture stimulations and water flooding will help offset declines due to increasing water production in the expected production rates for will be similar to those averaged in  but may be lower than the exit rate at december  production volumes vs 
net production volumes increased at the dagang field for as a result of the development program  oil production volume increased by or by mboe in when compared to during we placed new wells on production and fracture stimulated wells in the northern block of this project and in we completed one well  fracture stimulated wells and re completed wells 
additionally  volumes at the dagang field increased in when compared to by or mboe due to the re acquisition of richfirst s working interest in this project in february as at december   wells were on production and producing  gross bopd  net bopd 
our royalty percentage from the daqing field was reduced from to in may when the operator of the properties reached payout of its investment 
as a result  our share of production volumes decreased for compared to the same period in in addition  production from the field is declining 
operating costs vs 
operating costs in china  including engineering and support costs and windfall levy  increased or per boe for when compared to field operating costs increased per boe 
in addition to the excessive down hole maintenance problems mentioned above  which resulted in increased workover and maintenance costs  increased power costs  additional operator salaries and higher supervision charges in relation to reduced volumes contributed to the increase 
as more fully described below  beginning march  the china oil operations became subject to the windfall levy 
this resulted in a per boe increase for partially as a result of the being the first full year of the levy and partially due to higher oil prices 
engineering and support costs for increased by per boe or as we continue to reduce the number of capital projects 
we expect costs in to remain consistent on a per barrel basis as compared to decreases resulting from one time maintenance projects in and the ability to charge cnpc for its share of operating costs  expected to be mid way through once we reach commercial production  will be offset by an increase in office costs allocated to operations as we continue to reduce the number of capital projects 
operating costs vs 
operating costs in china  including engineering and support costs and windfall levy  increased or per boe for when compared to field operating costs increased due to high power costs  increased workover and maintenance costs  related supervision and increased treatment and processing fees attributable to higher water production rates 
with the suspension of our drilling activity at our dagang field in december  a major portion of our dagang field office costs  which were previously being capitalized  were expensed as part of our operating activities 
engineering and support costs increased due to a higher allocation of support to production as we reduced our capital activity in the dagang field in when compared to the increase in production volume in due to the drilling program at the dagang field  in relation to the level of support required to operate the field  results in the per boe decrease for when compared to in march  the ministry of finance of the peoples republic of china prc issued the administrative measures on collection of windfall gain levy on oil exploitation business the windfall levy measures 
according to the windfall levy measures  effective as of march   enterprises exploiting and selling crude oil in the prc are subject to a windfall gain levy the windfall levy if the monthly weighted average price of crude oil is above per barrel 
the windfall levy is imposed at progressive rates from to on the portion of the weighted average sales price exceeding per barrel 
for financial statement presentation the windfall levy is included in operating costs 
the windfall levy resulted in per boe of the overall increase in when compared to us production volumes vs 
as at december   we were producing gross boe d net boe d at south midway compared to gross boe d net boe d as at december  us production volumes decreased in when compared to mainly due to a decline in production at south midway resulting from steam generator downtime during the second and third quarters  along with certain wells taken offline to be soaked and steamed once that steaming operation came back on line 
the purchase of a second steam generator and the retrofit of an existing generator should allow for a full steaming program for as well  we expect the current drilling program at south midway to offset natural declines within this field and to provide additional future drilling locations 
in addition to the natural declines in production within our spraberry field in west texas  production was also hampered by a key producer being down for repairs in the third quarter 
we expect that production at our spraberry field will continue its modest declines 
production volumes vs 
us production volumes decreased in when compared to mainly as a result of the decline in production from the knights landing field which had been depleted to minimal levels at the end of and the sale of our citrus property effective february  in addition  our production at south midway decreased for primarily as a result of several wells in the southern expansion of south midway being down while we made repairs to our steam facilities 
contributions from the two in fill wells in the southern expansion and seven in fill wells in the primary area of south midway drilled and completed in the second half of were not a major impact until as at december   we were producing gross boe d net boe d at south midway compared to gross boe d net boe d as at december  operating costs vs 
operating costs in the us  including engineering and support costs and production taxes  increased or per boe for when compared to field operating costs increased per boe due to increases to maintenance costs and workovers at spraberry and steaming projects in the diatomite formation at north salt creek 
these increases were somewhat offset due to a reduction in our south midway steaming operations as we were in the process of replacing a steam generator  including purchasing and subsequent retro fit  which was completed and put on line in the third quarter 
we also had our other steam generator down for repairs during the second quarter 
in addition to this overall increase  engineering and support costs for increased by per boe mainly due to a higher allocation of support to production as capital activity decreased 
we anticipate operating expense to increase in mainly as a result of the steaming operations at south midway operating at full capacity versus a reduced capacity in due to the reasons described above 
we expect the operating costs at spraberry to be consistent with we are uncertain about the expected operating expenses at north salt creek as we are currently evaluating recent steam stimulation tests 
operating costs vs 
operating costs in the us  including engineering and support costs and production taxes  in decreased million in absolute terms from however  on a per boe basis operating costs increased or per boe in when compared to field operating costs increased per boe for when compared to  primarily resulting from increases in primary operating costs at south midway due to several maintenance projects related to the processing facilities 
although costs in the south midway steaming operations did not fluctuate significantly in absolute terms  they did make up a larger portion of the overall cost per boe as production in other fields declined 
engineering support increased per boe for  when compared to as the same level of support was required to operate the fields even though there was a decline in production 
production taxes were up per boe for when compared to  largely as the result of an increase in ad valorem taxes at south midway and our spraberry field in west texas

general and administrative vs 
china general and administrative expenses related to the china operations decreased million for due to a million one time charge in for the write off of deferred costs incurred associated with financing discussions for our dagang field development project 
this decrease was primarily offset by an increase of million in foreign currency losses 
us general and administrative expenses related to us operations increased million in allocations to capital investments decreased million as a result of less capital activity for when compared to this increase in expense was offset by a decrease of million for bonuses accrued in compared to nil in  a million decrease in stock based compensation and a decrease of million for a reduction in contract labor

these increases were offset by a million decrease in reduced professional fees incurred to comply with the provisions of section of sox as a portion of the sox review was performed in the first quarter of in addition  costs for sox were lower as there were no start up costs that we experienced in business and technology development our changes in business and technology development  before and after considering increases in non cash stock based compensation  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period for and for the year ended december  when compared to the same period for were as follows vs vs favorable unfavorable variances htl tm gtl less stock based compensation business and technology development vs 
business and technology development expenses increased million in compared to as we continued to focus on business and technology development activities related to htl tm opportunities 
the overall increase in htl tm related to salaries and benefits was million 
in addition to a reallocation of resources see g a explanations above to htl tm  and discretionary bonuses  key personnel were added to this segment throughout as the company develops its commercialization program for its technology 
this increase was partially offset by an increased million allocation to capital investments 
this segment also increased as a result of million higher operating costs at the cdf 
operating expenses of the cdf to develop and identify improvements in the application of the htl tm technology are a part of our business and technology development activities 
this increase was in part the result of several heavy oil upgrading runs in the first and second quarters of  including a key athabasca bitumen test run 
the company will use the information derived from the athabasca bitumen test run for the design and development of full scale commercial projects in western canada 
in addition  the htl tm segment increased million as a result of higher outside engineering fees and legal fees related to patents and million due to a shift in resources from gtl 
the remainder of the increase is related to consulting fees and travel costs to develop opportunities for our htl tm technology 
we expect a decrease in cdf operating expenses in when compared to as we have now fulfilled the primary technical objectives of the cdf 
business and technology development vs 
as in most of the focus of our business and technology development activities was on htl tm opportunities 
operating expenses of the cdf to develop and identify improvements in the application of the htl tm technology are expensed as part of our business and technology development activities and contributed million to the increase in business and technology development for htl tm activities in part of this increase was due to the cdf operating for a full year in versus a partial year in in addition contract services  including engineering work related to cdf processing runs and legal fees related to patents  increased million in the remainder of the increase is related to consulting fees and travel costs to develop opportunities for our htl tm technology 
write off of deferred acquisition costs in february  the company signed a non binding memorandum of understanding regarding a proposed merger of sunwing with china mineral acquisition corporation cma  a us public corporation 
in may the parties entered a definitive agreement for the transaction 
cma s bylaws stipulated that if the transaction was not completed by august  cma would be required to dissolve and distribute its assets substantially all of which was cash to its shareholders 
cma requested  but was unable to obtain  an extension of this deadline from its shareholders 
since the transaction could not be completed by the august deadline  the definitive agreement was terminated and the company wrote off deferred acquisition costs previously capitalized in the amount of million 
there were no such costs in or net interest net interest vs 
interest expense was higher in when compared to partially due to an additional draw down on our us loan and the funding of a new loan for china 
these higher amounts were offset by a decrease related to the early pay off of the term note see vs 
analysis below 
in addition  interest income decreased by million as average cash balances were lower throughout when compared to net interest vs 
in  we borrowed the full amount of a million stand by loan facility  which we arranged in  and amended the loan agreement to provide the lender the right to convert unpaid principal and interest during the loan term to the company s common shares 
we finalized a second convertible loan agreement with the same lender for million 
in the fourth quarter of  these two convertible loans totaling million were exchanged for a million term note 
this term note was paid off early in the second quarter of the reduction in interest and financing costs resulting from the reduction in these loans from year to year was million 
in addition  interest income increased by million as average cash balances were significantly higher throughout when compared to these favorable increases were offset by a million increase in interest and financing costs related to the note with citic 
this note was part of the consideration for the re acquisition of the interest in the dagang field 
unrealized loss on derivative instruments as a result of a requirement of the company s lenders  the company entered into costless collar derivatives to minimize variability in its cash flow from the sale of approximately of the company s estimated production from its south midway property in california and spraberry property in west texas over a two year period starting november and a six month period starting november the derivatives have a ceiling price of  and  per barrel and a floor price of  and  per barrel  respectively  using wti as the index traded on the nymex 
also as a result of a requirement of the company s lenders  the company entered into a costless collar derivative to minimize variability in its cash flow from the sale of approximately of the company s estimated production from its dagang field in china over a three year period starting september this derivative has a ceiling price of per barrel and a floor price of per barrel using the wti as the index traded on the nymex 
the company is required to account for these contracts using mark to market accounting 
as forecasted benchmark prices exceed the ceiling prices set in the contract  the contracts have negative value or a liability 
these benchmark prices reached record highs in for the year ended december   the company had million unrealized losses in its us segment and million unrealized losses in its china segment on these derivative transactions 
the million unrealized loss for was related to the us segment 
depletion and depreciation the primary expense in this classification is depletion of the carrying values of our oil and gas properties in our us and china cost centers over the life of their proved oil and gas reserves as determined by independent reserve evaluators 
for more information on how we calculate depletion and determine our proved reserves see critical accounting principles and estimates oil and gas reserves and depletion in this item depletion and depreciation vs 
depletion and depreciation decreased million in  partially due to reduced depletion of million 
the overall reduction in depletion was mainly the result of lower production rates which resulted in a decrease in depletion of million for this decrease was somewhat offset by a higher depletion rate of per boe which resulted in additional depletion expense of million 
reduced depreciation of the cdf as a result of a longer depreciation period also contributed to the overall decrease in depletion and depreciation in the amount of million for china decreases in production volumes in china resulted in a decrease in depletion expense of million for when compared to china s depletion rate decreased per boe to for when compared to  resulting in a million decrease in depletion expense 
the decrease in the rates from year to year was mainly due to a million ceiling test write down in the fourth quarter of this decrease was somewhat offset by an increase to the depletable pool in the fourth quarter of for the impairment of the drilling costs associated with the second exploration well in the zitong block 
us the us depletion rate for was per boe compared to per boe for  an increase of per boe resulting in a million increase in depletion expense 
this increase was mainly due to the fourth quarter impairment of certain properties  including north yowlumne  lak ranch and catfish creek  resulting in million of those costs being included with our proved properties and therefore subject to depletion 
in addition  the capital spending we incurred in was related to facilities  versus drilling  and therefore did not correspondingly increase our reserve base 
additionally  decreases in production volumes in the us accounted for million of the decrease in depletion expense for htl tm depreciation of the cdf is calculated using the straight line method over its current useful life which is based on the existing term of the agreement with aera energy llc to use their property to test the cdf 
the end term of this agreement was extended in august from december  to december  and the useful life was extended to coincide with the new term of the agreement 
in addition to the change in life  depreciation expense also decreased as a result of a reduction in the depreciable base during the second quarter of due to a portion of the payment from inpex being applied against those costs 
depletion and depreciation vs 
depletion and depreciation increased million in  due to an increase in depletion rates of per boe resulting in additional depletion expense of million for additionally  higher production rates resulted in increase in depletion of million for we began depreciating the cdf in which also contributed to the overall increase in depletion and depreciation in the amount of million for china china s depletion rate for was per boe compared to per boe for the increase of per boe resulted in million increase in depletion expense for this increase was due mainly to two factors we suspended new drilling activity in december at our dagang field in order to assess production decline performances on recently drilled wells  as well as maximizing cash flow from these operations 
as a result  we reduced our estimate of the overall development program and our independent engineering evaluators  glj petroleum consultants ltd  revised downward their estimate of our proved reserves at december  in the second quarter of  we impaired the cost of our first zitong block exploration well resulting in million of those and other associated costs being included with our proved properties and therefore subject to depletion 
additionally  increases in production volumes in china accounted for million of the increase in depletion expense for us the us depletion rate for was per boe compared to per boe for  an increase of per boe resulting in a million increase in depletion expense 
this increase was mainly due to the impairment of the remaining cost of our northwest lost hills exploration well as at december   resulting in million of those costs being included with our proved properties and therefore subject to depletion commencing in the first quarter of in addition  the impairment of other properties in december  including yowlumne  lak ranch and catfish creek  resulted in million of those costs being included with our proved properties and therefore subject to depletion commencing in the fourth quarter of increases in revisions to reserve estimates at december   mainly at south midway  slightly offset the additional costs being added to the pool 
production volume decreases in the us resulted in a million decrease in our depletion expense for htl tm the cdf was in a commissioning phase as at december  and  as such  had not been depreciated as at december  the commissioning phase ended in january and the cdf was placed into service 
in million of depreciation was recorded for the cdf 
write down of htl tm and gtl development costs as discussed below in this item in critical accounting principles and estimates research and development  for canadian gaap we capitalize technical and commercial feasibility costs incurred for htl tm or gtl projects  including studies for the marketability of the projects products  subsequent to executing an mou 
if no definitive agreement is reached  then the capitalized costs  which are deemed to have no future value  are written down to our results of operations with a corresponding reduction in our investments in htl tm and gtl assets 
for us gaap  all such costs are expensed as incurred 
in and  we had no write downs for our htl tm and gtl projects 
this compares to the write down of million related to our gtl project in bolivia and million related to our mou with ecopetrol for a heavy crude project in colombia in impairment of oil and gas properties as discussed below in this item in critical accounting principles and estimates impairment of proved oil and gas properties  we evaluate each of our cost center s proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis 
if as a result of this evaluation  a cost center s carrying value exceeds its expected future net cash flows from its proved and probable reserves then a provision for impairment must be recognized in the results of operations 
impairment of oil and gas properties vs 
we impaired our china oil and gas properties by million in  compared to million in the impairment was mainly the result of impairing our costs incurred in the zitong block due to an unsuccessful second exploration well resulting in those costs of million being included with the carrying value of proved properties for the ceiling test calculation 
impairment of oil and gas properties vs 
we impaired our china oil and gas properties by million in  compared to million in the impairment was mainly the result of increased operating costs of the dagang field  including costs of the windfall levy established in march financial condition  liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our net cash and cash equivalents decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to an increase of million for and a decrease of million for operating activities our operating activities provided million in cash for the year ended december  compared to million and million for the same periods in and the decrease in cash from operating activities for the year ended december  was mainly due to a decrease in net production volumes of offset by an increase in oil and gas prices of  net of realized loss on derivative instruments associated with oil and gas operations 
in addition  increases to operating costs  general and administrative and business and technology development expenses also reduced operating cash flows 
the increases in cash from operating activities for the year ended december  was mainly due to an increase in net production volumes of and an increase in oil and gas prices of 
the increase in net revenues for the year ended december  was partially offset by an increase of million in general and administrative and business and technology development expenses  excluding stock based compensation for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in investing activities our investing activities used million in cash for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in for we increased our capital asset expenditures by million mainly the result of increased exploration expenditures at our zitong project of million and increased development expenditures for new drilling at our dagang project of million 
capital spending related to htl tm increased by million as expenditures for the ftf increased by million but were offset by decreased expenditures of million for the cdf 
an offset to the increase in capital expenditures was the receipt of a payment of million received from inpex as payment for the company s past costs related to its iraq project and htl tm technology development costs 
this amount was offset by a decrease in cash inflows from asset sales of million in the us in  compared to million for the same period in in addition in we used million more cash for investing activities related to changes in working capital items as we significantly reduced capital program accounts payable in our china operation 
our investing activities used million in cash for the year ended december  compared to million used in investing activities for the same period in for  we reduced our capital asset expenditures by million principally as a result of reduced expenditures for new drilling at our dagang project of million  reduced exploration expenditures of million at our zitong project and reduced expenditures of million on projects in iraq 
in  we generated million of cash from asset sales in the us compared to nil for the year ended december  in addition  during  we spent million on the ensyn merger  which was completed in april  including million on the acquisition of the remaining joint venture interest in the cdf  and we advanced million under a consultancy agreement 
these decreases in our investing activities for the year ended december  were partially offset by a million increase in our non cash working capital associated with our investing activities 
financing activities financing activities for the year ended december  consisted of three draws totaling million million net of financing costs on two separate loan facilities 
this increase in borrowings was offset by scheduled debt payments of million 
in we repaid notes in the amount of million prior to maturity  made scheduled repayments of long term debt of million offset by an initial draw on a bank loan facility of million million net of financing costs 
financing activities in also consisted of million received from the exercise of warrants compared to when there were no warrants exercised but there was a million private placement of common shares 
our financing activities provided million in cash for year ended december  compared to million of cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  the million decrease in cash from financing activities is mainly due to a million decrease in cash from private placements and exercises of warrants and options in addition to a million decrease in net debt financing 
in april the company closed a private placement of million special warrants at per special warrant for a total of million 
each special warrant entitles the holder to receive  at no additional cost  one common share and one common share purchase warrant 
all of the special warrants were subsequently exercised for common shares and common share purchase warrants 
each common share purchase warrant originally entitled the holder to purchase one common share at a price of per share until the fifth anniversary date of the closing 
in september  these warrants were listed on the toronto stock exchange and the exercise price was changed to cdn 
of the proceeds  million has been used to pay down long term debt and the balance will be used to pursue opportunities for the commercial deployment of the company s heavy oil upgrading technology  to advance its oil and gas operations and for general corporate purposes 
outlook for our capital program budget ranges from approximately million to million and will encompass both continuing development of our existing producing oil and gas properties to maximize near term cash flow and to further the development and deployment of our proprietary htl tm oil upgrading technology 
management s plans include alliances or other arrangements with entities with the resources to support the company s projects as well as project financing  debt and mezzanine financing or the sale of equity securities in order to generate sufficient resources to meet its capital investment and operating objectives 
the company intends to utilize revenue from existing operations to fund the continuing transition of the company to a heavy oil exploration  production and upgrading company and non heavy oil related investments in our portfolio will be leveraged or monetized to capture value and provide maximum return for the company 
no assurances can be given that we will be able to enter into one or more alternative business alliances with other parties or raise additional capital 
if we are unable to enter into such business alliances or obtain adequate additional financing  we will be required to curtail our operations  which may include the sale of assets

we have excluded our normal purchase arrangements as they are discretionary and or being performed under contracts which are cancelable immediately or with a day notification period 
critical accounting principles and estimates our accounting principles are described in note to notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap in canada  which conform in all material respects to us gaap except for those items disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
for us readers  we have detailed the differences and have also provided a reconciliation of the differences between canadian and us gaap in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis we evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
full cost accounting we follow accounting guideline oil and gas accounting full cost acg in accounting for our oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method of accounting  all exploration and development costs associated with lease and royalty interest acquisition  geological and geophysical activities  carrying charges for unproved properties  drilling both successful and unsuccessful wells  gathering and production facilities and equipment  financing  administrative costs directly related to capital projects and asset retirement costs are capitalized on a country by country cost center basis 
as at december   the carrying values of our us and china cost centers were million and million  respectively 
the other generally accepted method of accounting for costs incurred for oil and gas properties is the successful efforts method 
under this method  costs associated with land acquisition and geological and geophysical activities are expensed in the year incurred and the costs of drilling unsuccessful wells are expensed upon abandonment 
as a consequence of following the full cost method of accounting  we may be more exposed to potential impairments if the carrying value of a cost center s oil and gas properties exceeds its estimated future net cash flows than if we followed the successful efforts method of accounting 
an impairment may occur if a cost center s recoverable reserve estimates decrease  oil and natural gas prices decline or capital  operating and income taxes increase to levels that would significantly affect its estimated future net cash flows 
see impairment of proved oil and gas properties below 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of reserves is inherently uncertain and complex 
it requires significant judgments and decisions based on available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
these estimates may change substantially as additional data from ongoing development activities and production performance becomes available and as economic conditions impacting oil and gas prices and costs change 
our reserve estimates are based on current production forecasts  prices and economic conditions 
reserve numbers and values are only estimates and you should not assume that the present value of our future net cash flows from these estimates is the current market value of our estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
reserve estimates are critical to many accounting estimates and financial decisions including determining whether or not an exploratory well has found economically recoverable reserves 
such determinations involve the commitment of additional capital to develop the field based on current estimates of production forecasts  prices and other economic conditions 
calculating our unit of production depletion rates 
proved reserves are used to determine rates that are applied to each unit of production in calculating our depletion expense 
in  oil and gas depletion of million was recorded in depletion and depreciation expense 
if our reserve estimates changed by  our depletion and depreciation expense for would have changed by approximately million assuming no other changes to our reserve profile 
see depletion below 
assessing our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis 
estimated future net cash flows used to assess impairment of our oil and gas properties are determined using proved and probable reserves see impairment of proved oil and gas properties below 
management is responsible for estimating the quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and preparing related disclosures 
estimates and related disclosures are prepared in accordance with sec requirements  generally accepted industry practices in the us as promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers  and the standards of the coge handbook modified to reflect sec requirements 
independent qualified reserves evaluators prepare reserve estimates for each property at least annually and issue a report thereon 
the reserve estimates are reviewed by our engineers familiar with the property and by our operational management 
our ceo and cfo meet with our operational personnel to review the current reserve estimates and related disclosures and upon their review and approval present the independent qualified reserves evaluators reserve reports to our board of directors with a recommendation for approval 
our board of directors has approved the reserve estimates and related disclosures 
the estimated discounted future net cash flows from estimated proved reserves included in the supplementary financial information are based on prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower 
actual future net cash flows will also be affected by factors such as actual production levels and timing  and changes in governmental regulation or taxation  and may differ materially from estimated cash flows 
depletion as indicated previously  our estimate of proved reserves are critical to calculating our unit of production depletion rates 
another critical factor affecting our depletion rate is our determination that an impairment of unproved oil and gas properties has occurred 
costs incurred on an unproved oil and gas property are excluded from the depletion rate calculation until it is determined whether proved reserves are attributable to an unproved oil and gas property or upon determination that an unproved oil and gas property has been impaired 
an unproved oil and gas property would likely be impaired if  for example  a dry hole has been drilled and there are no firm plans to continue drilling on the property 
also  the likelihood of partial or total impairment of a property increases as the expiration of the lease term approaches and there are no plans to drill on the property or to extend the term of the lease 
we assess each of our unproved oil and gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis 
if we determine that an unproved oil and gas property has been totally or partially impaired we include all or a portion of the accumulated costs incurred for that unproved oil and gas property in the calculation of our unit of production depletion rate 
as at december   we had million and million of costs incurred on unproved oil and gas properties in the us and china  respectively 
our depletion rate is also affected by our estimates of future costs to develop the proved reserves 
we estimate future development costs using quoted prices  historical costs and trends 
it is difficult to predict prices for materials and services required to develop a field particularly over a period of years with rising oil and gas prices during which proved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty can be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
reservoirs are considered proved if economic recoverability is supported by either actual production or a conclusive formation test 
probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less likely to be recovered than proved reserves 
it is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves 
there is generally increased competition for a limited number of suppliers 
we update our estimates of future costs to develop our proved reserves on a quarterly basis 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties we evaluate each of our cost centers proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the basis for calculating the amount of impairment is different for canadian and us gaap purposes 
for canadian gaap  acg requires recognition and measurement processes to assess impairment of oil and gas properties ceiling test 
in the recognition of an impairment  the carrying value of a cost center is compared to the undiscounted future net cash flows of that cost center s proved reserves using estimates of future oil and gas prices and costs plus the cost of unproved properties that have been excluded from the depletion calculation 
if the carrying value is greater than the value of the undiscounted future net cash flows of the proved reserves plus the cost of unproved properties excluded from the depletion calculation  then the amount of the cost center s potential impairment must be measured 
a cost center s impairment loss is measured by the amount its carrying value exceeds the discounted future net cash flows of its proved and probable reserves using estimates of future oil and gas prices and costs plus the cost of unproved properties that have been excluded from the depletion calculation and which contain no probable reserves 
the net cash flows of a cost center s proved and probable reserves are discounted using a risk free interest rate adjusted for political and economic risk on a country by country basis 
the amount of the impairment loss is recognized as a charge to the results of operations and a reduction in the net carrying amount of a cost center s oil and gas properties 
we provided for million  million and million in a ceiling test impairment for our china cost center for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for us gaap  we follow the requirements of the sec s regulation s x article c for determining the limitation of capitalized costs 
accordingly  the carrying value of a cost center s oil and gas properties cannot exceed the future net cash flows  discounted at  of its proved reserves using period end oil and gas prices and costs plus i the cost of properties that have been excluded from the depletion calculation and ii the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties included in the depletion calculation less iii income tax effects related to differences between the book and tax basis of the properties 
the amount of the impairment loss is recognized as a charge to the results of operations and a reduction in the net carrying amount of a cost center s oil and gas properties 
we provided for nil  million and million in ceiling test impairments for our us cost center for the years ended december   and  respectively  and million  million and million for the years ended december   and for our china cost center 
asset retirement for canadian gaap  we follow canadian institute of chartered accountants cica section  asset retirement obligations which requires asset retirement costs and liabilities associated with site restoration and abandonment of tangible long lived assets be initially measured at a fair value which approximates the cost a third party would incur in performing the tasks necessary to retire such assets 
the fair value is recognized in the financial statements at the present value of expected future cash outflows to satisfy the obligation 
subsequent to the initial measurement  the effect of the passage of time on the liability for the asset retirement obligation accretion expense and the amortization of the asset retirement cost are recognized in the results of operations 
we measure the expected costs required to retire our producing us oil and gas properties at a fair value  which approximates the cost a third party would incur in performing the tasks necessary to abandon the field and restore the site 
we do not make such a provision for our oil and gas operations in china as there is no obligation on our part to contribute to the future cost to abandon the field and restore the site 
asset retirement costs are depleted using the unit of production method based on estimated proved reserves and are included with depletion and depreciation expense 
the accretion of the liability for the asset retirement obligation is included with interest expense 
for canadian gaap  the carrying value includes all capitalized costs for each cost center  including costs associated with asset retirement net of estimated salvage values  unproved properties and major development projects  less accumulated depletion and ceiling test impairments 
this is essentially the same definition according to us gaap  under regulation s x  except that the carrying value of assets should be net of deferred income taxes and costs of major development projects are to be considered separately for purposes of the ceiling test calculation 
for us gaap  we follow sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations which conforms in all material respects with canadian gaap 
research and development we incur various expenses in the pursuit of htltm and gtl projects  including htl tm technology for heavy oil processing  throughout the world 
for canadian gaap  such expenses incurred prior to signing an mou  or similar agreements  are considered to be business and technology development expenses and are charged to the results of operations as incurred 
upon executing an mou to determine the technical and commercial feasibility of a project  including studies for the marketability of the projects products  we assess that the feasibility and related costs incurred have potential future value  are probable of leading to a definitive agreement for the exploitation of proved reserves and should be capitalized 
if no definitive agreement is reached  then the capitalized costs  which are deemed to have no future value  are written down to our results of operations with a corresponding reduction in our investments in htl tm or gtl assets 
for the years ended december   and  we wrote down nil  nil and million  respectively  of capitalized negotiation and feasibility costs associated with our htl tm and gtl projects which did not result in definitive agreements 
additionally  we incur costs to develop  enhance and identify improvements in the application of the htl tm and gtl technologies we license or own 
we follow cica section research and development costs in accounting for the development costs of equipment and facilities acquired or constructed for such purposes 
development costs are capitalized and amortized over the expected economic life of the equipment or facilities commencing with the start up of commercial operations for which the equipment or facilities are intended 
we review the recoverability of such capitalized development costs annually  or as changes in circumstances indicate the development costs might be impaired  through an evaluation of the expected future discounted cash flows from the associated projects 
if the carrying value of such capitalized development costs exceeds the expected future discounted cash flows  the excess is written down to the results of operations with a corresponding reduction in the investments in htl tm and gtl assets 
costs incurred in the operation of equipment and facilities used to develop or enhance htl tm and gtl technologies prior to commencing commercial operations are business and technology development expenses and are charged to the results of operations in the period incurred 
for us gaap  we follow sfas no 
 research and development 
as with canadian gaap  costs of equipment or facilities that are acquired or constructed for research and development activities are capitalized as tangible assets and amortized over the expected economic life of the equipment or facilities commencing with the start up of commercial operations for which the equipment or facilities are intended 
however  for us gaap such facilities must have alternative future uses to be capitalized 
as with canadian gaap  expenses incurred in the operation of research and development equipment or facilities prior to commencing commercial operations are business and technology development expenses and are charged to the results of operations in the period incurred 
the major difference for us gaap purposes is that feasibility  marketing and related costs incurred prior to executing a definitive agreement are considered to be research and development costs and are expensed as incurred 
for the years ended december   and  we expensed million  million and million  respectively  of feasibility  marketing and related costs incurred prior to executing definitive agreements 
intangible assets our intangible assets consists of the underlying value of an exclusive  irrevocable license to deploy  worldwide  the rtp tm process for petroleum applications htl tm technology as well as the exclusive right to deploy the rtp tm process in all applications other than biomass and a master license from syntroleum permitting us to use the syntroleum process in an unlimited number of projects around the world 
for canadian gaap  we follow cica section goodwill and other intangible assets whereby intangible assets  acquired individually or with a group of other assets  are initially recognized and measured at cost 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives whereas intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized unless it is subsequently determined to have a finite useful life 
intangible assets are reviewed annually for impairment  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable 
if the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value or expected future discounted cash flows  the excess is written down to the results of operations with a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of the intangible asset 
the htl tm technology and the syntroleum gtl master license have finite lives  which correlate with the useful lives of the facilities we expect to develop that will use the technologies 
the amount of the carrying value of the technologies we assign to each facility will be amortized to earnings on a basis related to the operations of the facility from the date on which the facility is placed into service 
we evaluate the carrying values of the htltm technology and the syntroleum gtl master license annually  or as changes in circumstances indicate the intangible assets might be impaired  based on an assessment of its fair market value 
for us gaap  we follow sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which conforms in all material respects with canadian gaap 
accounting changes on january  we adopted six new accounting standards that were issued by the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica handbook section accounting changes s  handbook section comprehensive income s  handbook section equity s  handbook section financial instruments recognition and measurement s  handbook section financial instruments disclosure and presentation s 
and handbook section hedges s 
the company has adopted the new standards on january  in accordance with the transitional provision in each respective section 
comparative figures have not been restated 
the objective of s 
is to prescribe the criteria for changing accounting policies  together with the accounting treatment and disclosure of changes in accounting policies  changes in accounting estimates and corrections of errors 
this section is intended to enhance the relevance and reliability of an entity s financial statements and the comparability of those financial statements over time and with the financial statements of other entities 
there was no material impact on adoption of this section 
s 
introduces comprehensive income  which consists of net income and other comprehensive income oci 
oci represents changes in shareholder s equity during a period arising from transactions and other events with non owner sources 
there was no material impact on adoption of this section  there is no difference between the net loss presented in the accompanying statement of operations 
s 
establishes standards for the presentation of equity and changes in equity during a reporting period 
there was no material impact on adoption of this section 
s 
establishes standards for recognizing and measuring financial assets and financial liabilities and non financial derivatives as required to be disclosed under s 
it requires that financial assets and financial liabilities  including derivatives  be recognized on the balance sheet when the company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument or non financial derivative contract 
under this standard  all financial instruments are required to be measured at fair value on initial recognition except for certain related party transactions 
measurement in subsequent periods depends on whether the financial instrument has been classified as held for trading  available for sale  held to maturity  loans and receivables  or other financial liabilities 
financial assets the company s financial assets are comprised of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  advances and other long term assets 
these financial assets are classified as loans and receivables or held for trading financial assets as appropriate 
the classification of financial assets is determined at initial recognition 
when financial assets are recognized initially  they are measured at fair value  normally being the transaction price 
transaction costs for all financial assets are expensed as incurred 
financial assets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for sale in the short term 
cash and cash equivalents and derivatives in a positive fair value position are also classified as held for trading 
held for trading assets are carried on the balance sheet at fair value with gains or losses recognized in the income statement 
the estimated fair value of held for trading assets is determined by reference to quoted market prices and  if not available  on estimates from third party brokers or dealers 
loans and receivables are non derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments 
accounts receivable  advances and certain other assets have been classified as loans and receivables 
such assets are carried at amortized cost  as the time value of money is not significant 
gains and losses are recognized in income when the loans and receivables are derecognized or impaired 
the company assesses at each balance sheet date whether a financial asset carried at cost is impaired 
if there is objective evidence that an impairment loss exists  the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset and its fair value 
the carrying amount of the asset is reduced with the amount of the loss recognized in earnings 
financial liabilities financial liabilities are classified as held for trading financial liabilities or other financial liabilities as appropriate 
financial liabilities include accounts payable and accrued liabilities  derivative financial instruments  credit facilities and long term debt 
the classification of financial liabilities is determined at initial recognition 
held for trading financial liabilities represent financial contracts that were acquired for sale in the short term or derivatives that are in a negative fair market value position 
the estimated fair value of held for trading liabilities is determined by reference to quoted market prices and  if not available  on estimates from third party brokers or dealers 
other financial liabilities are non derivative financial liabilities with fixed or determinable payments 
short term other financial liabilities are carried at cost as the time value of money is not significant 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities  notes payable and credit facilities have been classified as short term other financial liabilities 
gains and losses are recognized in income when the short term other financial liability is derecognized or impaired 
transaction costs for short term other financial liabilities are expensed as incurred 
long term other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost 
long term debt has been classified as long term other financial liabilities 
transaction costs for long term other financial liabilities are deducted from the related liability and accounted for using the effective interest rate method 
derivative financial instruments the company may periodically use different types of derivative instruments to manage its exposure to price volatility  thus mitigating fluctuations in commodity related cash flows 
the company currently uses costless collar derivative instruments to manage this exposure 
derivative financial instruments are classified as held for trading and recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value  either as an asset or as a liability under other current financial assets or other current financial liabilities  respectively 
changes in the fair value of these financial instruments  or unrealized gains and losses  are recognized in the statement of operations as revenues in the period in which they occur 
gains and losses related to the settlement of derivative contracts  or realized gains and losses  are recognized as revenues in the statement of operations 
contracts to buy or sell non financial items that are not in accordance with the company s expected purchase  sale or usage requirements are accounted for as derivative financial instruments 
there was no material impact on adoption of section s 
establishes standards for presentation of financial instruments and non financial derivatives  and identifies the information that should be disclosed about them 
the presentation aspect of this standard deals with the classification of financial instruments  from the perspective of the issuer  between liabilities and equity  the classification of related interest  dividends  losses and gains  and the circumstances in which financial assets and financial liabilities are offset 
the disclosure aspect of this standard deals with information about factors that affect the amount  timing and certainty of an entity s future cash flows relating to financial instruments 
this section also deals with disclosure of information about the nature and extent of an entity s use of financial instruments  the business purposes they serve  the risks associated with them and management s policies for controlling those risks 
there was no material impact on adoption of this section 
s 
specifies the criteria that must be satisfied in order for hedge accounting to be applied and the accounting for each of the permitted hedging strategies fair value hedges  cash flow hedges and hedges of foreign currency exposure of net investment in self sustaining foreign operations 
the company has not elected to designate any financial derivatives as accounting hedges at this time 
for us gaap  we follow sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas which conforms in all material respects with canadian gaap with respect to the treatment of costless collars 
impact of new and pending canadian gaap accounting standards in february  the canadian institute of chartered accountants cica issued section  goodwill and intangible assets  replacing section  goodwill and other intangible assets and section  research and development costs 
various changes have been made to other sections of the cica handbook for consistency purposes 
the new section will be applicable to financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after october  accordingly  the company will adopt the new standards for its fiscal year beginning january  it establishes standards for the recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of goodwill subsequent to its initial recognition and of intangible assets by profit oriented enterprises 
standards concerning goodwill are unchanged from the standards included in the previous section the company is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this new section on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the cica approved handbook section capital disclosures s  handbook section financial instruments disclosures s  and handbook section financial instruments presentation s 
s 
establishes standards for disclosing information about an entity s capital and how it is managed 
the objective of s 
is to require entities to provide disclosures in their financial statements that enable users to evaluate both the significance of financial instruments for the entity s financial position and performance  and the nature and extent of risks arising from financial instruments to which the entity is exposed during the period and at the balance sheet date  and how the entity manages those risks 
the purpose of s 
is to enhance financial statement users understanding of the significance of financial instruments to an entity s financial position  performance and cash flows 
these sections apply to interim and annual financial statements relating to fiscal years beginning on or after october  and the latter two will replace s 
management will adopt these new disclosure requirements in the first quarter of convergence of canadian gaap with international financial reporting standards in  canada s accounting standards board acsb ratified a strategic plan that will result in canadian gaap  as used by public companies  being converged with international financial reporting standards over a transitional period 
the acsb has developed and published a detailed implementation plan  with a changeover date for fiscal years beginning on or after january  this convergence initiative is in its early stages as of the date of these annual financial statements 
management has commenced a program of analyzing the company s historical financial information in order to assess the impact of the convergence on its financial statements 
impact of new and pending us gaap accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas no 

effective for fiscal years beginning after december   the standards will improve  simplify  and converge internationally the accounting for business combinations and the reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
sfas r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all and only the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information they need to evaluate and understand the nature and financial effect of the business combination 
sfas requires all entities to report noncontrolling minority interests in subsidiaries in the same way as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of these new standards on its financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

the statement would create a fair value option under which an entity may irrevocably elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for certain financial assets and financial liabilities on a contract by contract basis  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings as those changes occur 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  management has concluded that the requirements of this recent statement will not have a material impact on its financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  however  for some entities the application of this statement will change current practice 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years  although early adoption is permitted 
management has concluded that the requirements of this recent statement will not have a material impact on its financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
we do not have relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from their non independent relationship with us  or our related parties  except as disclosed herein 
related party transactions the company has entered into agreements with a number of entities  which are related through common directors or shareholders  to provide administrative or technical personnel  office space or facilities 
the company is billed on a cost recovery basis 
the costs incurred in the normal course of business with respect to the above arrangements amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as at december  and  amounts included in accounts payable under these arrangements were million and million  respectively 
certain factors affecting the business competition the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
our position in the oil and gas industry  which includes the search for and development of new sources of supply  is particularly competitive 
our competitors include major  intermediate and junior oil and natural gas companies and other individual producers and operators  many of which have substantially greater financial and human resources and more developed and extensive infrastructure than we do 
our larger competitors  by reason of their size and relative financial strength  can more easily access capital markets than we can and may enjoy a competitive advantage in the recruitment of qualified personnel 
they may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business more easily than we can  adversely affecting our competitive position 
our competitors may be able to pay more for producing oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for  and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can 
further  these companies may enjoy technological advantages and may be able to implement new technologies more rapidly than we can 
our ability to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to conduct efficient operations  to evaluate and select suitable properties  implement advanced technologies  and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
the oil and gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying energy  fuel and other needs of consumers 
environmental regulations our conventional oil and gas and htl tm operations are subject to various levels of government laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment in the countries in which they operate 
we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws 
in the us  environmental laws and regulations  implemented principally by the environmental protection agency  department of transportation and the department of the interior and comparable state agencies  govern the management of hazardous waste  the discharge of pollutants into the air and into surface and underground waters and the construction of new discharge sources  the manufacture  sale and disposal of chemical substances  and surface and underground mining 
these laws and regulations generally provide for civil and criminal penalties and fines  as well as injunctive and remedial relief 
china continues to develop and implement more stringent national environmental protection regulations and standards for different industries 
projects are currently monitored by provincial and local governments based on the approved standards specified in the environmental impact statement prepared for individual projects 
environmental provisions as at december   a million provision has been made for future site restoration and plugging and abandonment of wells in the us and million for the removal of the cdf and restoration of the aera site occupied by the cdf 
the future cost of these obligations is estimated at million and million for the us wells and cdf  respectively 
we do not make such a provision for our oil and gas operations in china  as there is no obligation on our part to contribute to the future cost to abandon the field and restore the site 
during  our provision for future site restoration and plugging and abandonment of us wells stayed constant and we increased our provision for the cdf by million 
government regulations our business is subject to certain us and chinese federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for  and development  production and marketing of  crude oil and natural gas  as well as environmental and safety matters 
in addition  the chinese government regulates various aspects of foreign company operations in china 
such laws and regulations have generally become more stringent in recent years both in the us and china  often imposing greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties 
because the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are frequently changed  we are not able to predict the ultimate cost of compliance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to normal market risks inherent in the oil and gas business  including equity market risk  commodity price risk  foreign currency rate risk  interest rate risk and credit risk 
we recognize these risks and manage our operations to minimize our exposures to the extent practicable 
non trading equity market risks we currently have limited production in the us and china  which have not generated sufficient cash from operations to fund our exploration and development activities 
historically  we have relied on the equity markets as the primary source of capital to fund our expansion and growth opportunities 
based on our current plans  we estimate that we will need approximately to million to fund our capital investment programs for we can give no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining financing as and when needed 
factors beyond our control may make it difficult or impossible for us to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
failure to obtain any required financing on a timely basis may cause us to postpone our development plans  forfeit rights in some or all of our projects or reduce or terminate some or all of our operations 
commodity price risk commodity price risk related to crude oil prices is one of our most significant market risk exposures 
crude oil prices and quality differentials are influenced by worldwide factors such as opec actions  political events and supply and demand fundamentals 
to a lesser extent we are also exposed to natural gas price movements 
natural gas prices are generally influenced by oil prices  north american supply and demand and local market conditions 
based on the company s estimated worldwide crude oil production levels  a bbl change in the price of oil  would increase or decrease net income and cash from operations for by million 
based on the company s estimated natural gas production levels and consumption levels in its oil operations  a mcf increase in the price of natural gas would decrease our net income and cash from operations for by million and a mcf decrease in the price would have the opposite effect on our net income and cash from operations 
we periodically engage in the use of derivatives to minimize variability in our cash flow from operations and currently have costless collar contracts put in place as part of our bank loan facilities 
the company entered into costless collar derivatives to minimize variability in its cash flow from the sale of approximately of the company s estimated production from its south midway property in california and spraberry property in west texas over a two year period starting november and a six month period starting november the derivatives had a ceiling price of  and  per barrel and a floor price of  and  per barrel  respectively  using wti as the index traded on the nymex 
the company also entered into a costless collar derivative to minimize variability in its cash flow from the sale of approximately of the company s estimated production from its dagang field in china over a three year period starting september this derivative had a ceiling price of per barrel and a floor price of per barrel using wti as the index traded on the nymex 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on december   the company s open positions on the derivatives mentioned above had a fair value of million 
a increase in oil prices would increase the fair value by approximately million  while a decrease in prices would reduce the fair value by approximately million 
the fair value change assumes volatility based on prevailing market parameters at december  decreases in oil and natural gas prices would negatively impact our results of operations as a direct result of a reduction in revenues but may also do so in the ceiling test calculation for the impairment of our oil and gas properties 
on a quarterly basis  we compare the value of our proved and probable reserves  using estimated future oil and gas prices  to the carrying value of our oil and gas properties 
the ceiling test calculation is sensitive to oil and gas prices and in a period of declining prices could result in a charge to our results of operations as we experienced in when we recorded a million provision for impairment for canadian gaap and an additional million for us gaap mainly due to a decline in oil and gas prices 
decreases in oil and gas prices from those used in our ceiling test calculation as at december  as discussed above in critical accounting principles and estimates impairment of proved oil and gas properties may result in additional impairment provisions of our oil and gas properties 
foreign currency rate risk in the international petroleum industry  most production is bought and sold in us dollars or with reference to the us dollar 
accordingly  we do not expect to face foreign exchange risks associated with our production revenues 
the recoverable value of probable reserves is included only for the measurement of the impairment of the carrying value of oil and gas properties as required under canadian gaap but not for us gaap 
additionally  us gaap requires the use of period end oil and gas prices to measure the amount of the impairment rather than estimated future oil and gas prices as required by canadian gaap 
see critical accounting principles and estimates for the difference between canadian and us gaap in calculating the impairment provision for oil and gas properties 
the company s cash flow stream relating to certain international operations is based on the us dollar equivalent of cash flows measured in foreign currencies 
the majority of the operating costs incurred in our chinese operations are paid in chinese renminbi 
the majority of costs incurred in our administrative offices in vancouver and calgary  as well as some business development costs  are paid in canadian dollars 
disbursement transactions denominated in chinese renminbi and canadian dollars are converted to us dollar equivalents based on the exchange rate as of the transaction date 
foreign currency gains and losses also come about when monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the end of each month 
the expected impact of a strengthening or weakening of the chinese renminbi  and canadian dollar  as of december  on our net loss and cash flow is million  and million  respectively 
interest rate risk we currently have two separate bank loan facilities with fluctuating interest rates 
we estimate that our net loss and cash from operations for would change million for every change in interest rates 
credit risk the company is exposed to credit risk with respect to its accounts receivable 
most of the company s accounts receivable relate to oil and natural gas sales and are exposed to typical industry credit risks 
the company manages this credit risk by entering into sales contracts with only established entities and reviewing its exposure to individual entities on a regular basis 
losses associated with credit risk have been immaterial for all years presented 
trading we do not enter into contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had entered into such contracts
