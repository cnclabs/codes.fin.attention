item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview for additional overview information relating to our business  including actimmune  co promotion and our product development programs  please see the discussion in item business overview  which is incorporated herein by reference 
significant license acquisition agreements we are highly dependent on technology we license or acquire from third parties 
actimmune  which is currently our sole marketed product  is subject to a license agreement with genentech  inc the majority of our clinical development pipeline is also based on technology that we have licensed from third parties 
details of these agreements can be found elsewhere in this report under item business license and other agreements  notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  and under the heading results of operations below 
we will be required to make contingent milestone payments in accordance with all of our license and acquisition agreements in the aggregate amount of million if all of the milestones defined in each of the agreements are achieved 
these milestones include development  regulatory approval  commercialization and sales milestones 
our need for additional capital we commenced operations in and have incurred significant losses to date 
our revenue has been limited primarily to sales of actimmune  which has been declining in and  derived from physicians prescriptions for the off label use of actimmune in the treatment of ipf 
we expect to continue to incur net losses over the next several years as we continue the development of our advanced stage pulmonology pipeline and our research stage hepatology pipeline  apply for regulatory approvals and grow our operations 
although we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from our operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  settlement with the government  debt obligations and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least the end of  we believe that we will continue to require substantial additional funding to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our product candidates 
as a result  we may require additional funds 
table of contents and may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
if additional capital is not available  we may be forced to curtail our development activities or cease operations 
discontinuation of actimmune trial for ipf effective march   we made the decision to discontinue the phase iii inspire clinical trial evaluating actimmune in patients with ipf based upon the recommendation of the study s independent dmc 
as a result of the disappointing inspire trial results  we revised our estimates of inventory requirements as of december  accordingly  we recorded a charge of million in related to the prepayment of inventory that we were expecting to receive in and while we believe other actimmune related assets are recoverable for at least their million net carrying value  if sales decline below our revised estimates  we may incur additional asset impairment charges  including inventory writedowns in excess of the million recorded in  and impairment of acquired product rights  as well as product returns 
the following table reflects the asset balances as of december  which may be impacted in thousands finished goods inventory acquired product rights  net total we have also incurred approximately million in personnel related restructuring charges during  primarily consisting of severance related expenses to implement our announced plan to reduce the workforce by approximately  which has been completed as of september  we have also incurred approximately million in expenses in connection with the termination of our previous supply agreement with bi 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
these estimates are the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities  which in turn may impact our reported revenue and expenses 
we have discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially change the financial statements 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation beginning january   we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas no 
r  share based payment 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
in order to estimate the value of share based awards  we use the black scholes model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
if actual results differ 
table of contents significantly from any of these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of the our fiscal year sfas r supersedes our previous accounting under apb our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  which consisted of stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options  restricted stock and the employee stock purchase plan the espp 
stock based compensation expense of million for the year ended december  was related to restricted stock which we had been recognizing under previous accounting standards and option acceleration costs related to our divestiture of infergen and concurrent restructuring 
there was no stock based compensation expense related to the espp recognized during the year ended december  if all of the remaining restricted stock awards that were granted in  and became vested  we would recognize approximately million in compensation expense over a weighted average remaining period of years 
if all of the remaining nonvested and outstanding stock option awards that have been granted became vested  we would recognize approximately million in compensation expense over a weighted average remaining period of years 
however  no compensation expense will be recognized for any stock awards that do not vest 
revenue recognition and revenue reserves revenue on product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed  and final delivery has occurred and there is a reasonable assurance of collectibility of the amounts receivable from the customer 
therefore  revenue is generally recognized upon delivery when title passes to a credit worthy customer 
reserves are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for estimated returns  rebates  chargebacks and cash discounts  if applicable 
we sell to a limited number of customers  mainly specialty pharmacies and distributors 
we obtain written purchase authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price 
we are obligated to accept returns from customers if the pharmaceuticals they purchased have reached the expiration date 
we have demonstrated the ability to make reasonable and reliable estimates of product returns based on historical experience 
due to the nature of our business model and based on historical experience  these estimates are not highly subjective 
we review all sales transactions for potential rebates  chargebacks and discounts each month and monitor product ordering cycles and actual returns  product expiration dates and wholesale inventory levels to estimate potential product return rates 
we believe that our reserves are adequate 
for each of the periods presented below  we have not made any shipments as a result of incentives and or in excess of our customers ordinary course of business inventory levels 
specialty wholesalers maintain low inventory levels and manage their inventory levels to optimize patient based need demand and generally do not overstock actimmune 
the tables below present the amounts reported as revenue reductions for the periods indicated in thousands  except percentages years ended december  reductions to revenue cash discounts product returns chargebacks medicaid rebates total 
table of contents years ended december  gross product revenue revenue reductions as a of gross product revenue cash discounts product returns chargebacks medicaid rebates total in  chargebacks were approximately of gross revenue  but could reasonably fall within a range of to in any given year depending on the customer base 
if chargebacks had increased to during  this would have reduced our reported revenue by approximately million 
in  medicaid rebates were approximately of gross revenue  but could reasonably fall within a range of to in any given year 
if medicaid rebates had increased to during  this would have decreased our reported revenue by approximately million 
the ranges selected above are based on a review of historical trends and we believe they are reasonably likely to continue to be relevant in future periods 
chargebacks as a percentage of gross revenue increased in compared with and due to disappointing clinical trial results and our subsequent decision to discontinue further development of actimmune 
the decrease in medicaid rebates from in and in to in is due to the decreasing number of patients  as a percentage of the total patient population treated with actimmune  that are covered through state medicaid programs 
the source of information that we monitor in assisting us with computing chargebacks is from the federal supply schedule  veterans administration and public health system pricing documents 
these documents establish the maximum price allowable for the sale of our product to a government customer 
the chargeback amount per unit is computed as the difference between our sales price to the wholesaler and the selling price from the wholesaler to a government customer 
chargebacks are processed directly by the wholesalers and are deducted from payments to us 
the source of information that we monitor in assisting us with computing medicaid rebates is from each of the states 
medicaid rebates are billed directly to us from each state 
billings from each of the states  which are based on end user reports submitted by pharmacies to the state agencies  are typically received within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
we use historical billing and payment trends made to the states to assist us in determining an estimated medicaid rebate amount each period 
clinical trial accruals we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by contract research organizations based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with contract research organizations and review of contractual terms 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may overestimate or underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in the event we underestimate  we could be required to record significant additional research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
to date  we have not experienced changes in estimates that have led to material research and development expense adjustments being recorded in future periods 
inventory reserves our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market and our inventory costs are determined by the first in first out method 
we enter into purchase obligations to purchase our inventory based upon sales forecasts to enable us to mitigate some of the risk associated with the long lead times required to manufacture our products 

table of contents we write off the cost of inventory and reserve for future minimum purchase commitments  if any  that we consider to be in excess of forecasted future demand 
we define excess inventory as inventory that will expire before it can be sold  based on future sales forecasts 
in making these assessments  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand for current or committed inventory purchase levels 
we are also required to monitor the expiration dates of our products  since our products can no longer be used after their respective expiration dates 
in  in an effort to best manage the procurement and distribution of levels of actimmune  we successfully completed the necessary testing to extend the expiration period of actimmune from months to a total of months 
as part of our excess inventory assessment for actimmune  we also estimate the expiration date of any actimmune to be manufactured in the future 
projected revenue trends resulted in us recording charges during of million to cost of goods sold for excess inventories 
if actimmune revenue levels experienced in future periods are substantially below our current expectations  we could be required to record additional charges for excess inventories 
please refer to the statements under item a 
risk factors in this report to gain a better understanding of the possible reasons why actual results could differ from our estimates 
results of operations the following discussion of our continuing results of operations for each of the comparative periods excludes infergen related activity 
these amounts are reflected in discontinued operations as a result of the sale of the infergen product to valeant in december comparison of years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   we recorded total net revenue of million  compared to million for the same period in  a decrease of 
this decrease was attributable to a decrease in sales of actimmune of approximately million  or  partially offset by an increase in collaboration revenue of million resulting from the agreement with roche 
in early march  we announced that our phase iii inspire program for actimmune in ipf had been discontinued and that future actimmune revenue was expected to decline 
the million of collaboration revenue for includes a million milestone received in june  which had been assessed as substantially at risk at the initiation of the agreement and was therefore recognized as revenue when the milestone was achieved  as defined in the collaboration agreement 
for each of the years ended december  and  actimmune accounted for all of our product revenue 
substantially all of these sales were derived from physicians prescriptions for the off label use of actimmune in the treatment of ipf 
net revenue in includes approximately million of collaboration revenue  which represents amortization of the million upfront payment received from roche during the fourth quarter of there are a number of variables that impact actimmune revenue including  but not limited to  the discontinuation of the phase iii inspire clinical trial in march  the level of enrollment in ipf clinical trials of other companies  new patients started on therapy  average duration of therapy  new data on actimmune or other products presented at medical conferences and publications in medical journals  reimbursement and patient referrals from physicians 
in light of the failure of the inspire clinical trial  we expect that net sales of actimmune for the year ended december  will continue to decline 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold included product manufacturing costs  royalties and distribution costs associated with our product revenue and inventory writedowns 
cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was million  or approximately of total product revenue  compared to million  or approximately of total product revenue  in the corresponding period of the decrease in cost of goods sold primarily reflects the decline in actimmune revenue 
included in cost of goods sold is a charge of million recorded for excess inventory 
included in cost of goods sold is a charge of approximately million for excess inventories  recorded in connection with the impact of the disappointing phase iii inspire trial results announced in march excluding the million and million charges for excess inventory and purchase commitments in 
table of contents and  respectively  cost of goods sold was approximately and of product revenue for each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases may affect cost of goods sold on actimmune inventory purchased from bi 
in the past  we have utilized forward exchange contracts to partially offset the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  but we did not enter into any new contracts in or research and development expenses research and development r d expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to the full enrollment of our two phase iii capacity studies for pirfenidone during and the conduct of the phase a and b studies of itmn  partially offset by reduced costs related to the discontinuation of the inspire program and the full year reimbursement from roche under our collaboration agreement 
the following table lists our current product development programs and the research and development expenses recognized in connection with each program during the indicated periods 
the category titled programs non specific is comprised of facilities and personnel costs that are not allocated to a specific development program or discontinued programs and million and million of stock based compensation in and  respectively 
our management reviews each of these program categories in evaluating our business 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with developing our products  as well as the risks and uncertainties associated with potential commercialization of our product candidates  see the specific sections under item a 
risk factors above 
year ended december  development program in thousands pulmonology hepatology oncology programs non specific total the largest component of our total operating expenses is our ongoing investments in research and development and  in particular  the clinical development of our product pipeline 
the process of conducting the clinical research necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
current fda requirements for a new human drug to be marketed in the united states include the successful conclusion of preclinical laboratory and animal tests  if appropriate  to gain preliminary information on the product s safety  the submission of an ind with the fda to conduct human clinical trials for drugs  the successful completion of adequate and well controlled human clinical investigations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for its recommended use  and the submission by a company and acceptance and approval by the fda of an nda or bla for a drug product to allow commercial distribution of the drug 
in light of the factors mentioned above  we consider the active management and development of our clinical pipeline to be crucial to our long term success 
the actual probability of success for each candidate and clinical program may be impacted by a variety of factors  including  among others  the quality of the candidate  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition  manufacturing capability and commercial viability 
due to these factors  it is difficult to give accurate guidance on the anticipated proportion of our research and development investments or the future cash inflows from these programs 

table of contents acquired research and development and milestone expense credits in  we licensed from marnac and its co licensor  kdl  their worldwide rights  excluding japan  korea and taiwan  to develop and commercialize pirfenidone for all fibrotic diseases  including renal  liver and pulmonary fibrosis 
effective november   we entered into asset purchase agreements with marnac and kdl whereby we effectively terminated the prior license agreement by purchasing  among other things  the pirfenidone related assets covered by such prior license agreement 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreements  we made acquisition payments of approximately million 
contingent acquisition payments of up to an additional million would be made by us only if positive phase iii data and registration in the united states and european union are achieved 
there were no charges for acquired research and development and milestone payments in the year ended december  general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
the decreased spending for the year ended december  compared to the same period in reflects the impact of headcount and cost reductions related to the closure of the inspire trial for actimmune in march provision for government settlement on november   we received a subpoena from the us department of justice requiring us to provide the department of justice with certain information relating to actimmune  including information regarding the promotion and marketing of actimmune 
on october   we reached a comprehensive settlement with the government concerning promotional activities for actimmune by former employees during a period that ended in june a million charge was recorded during to reflect the final terms of the civil settlement agreement 
the settlement resolves without criminal sanctions  all outstanding government investigations of intermune 
we agreed to pay a total of million  plus interest on the then outstanding principal balance  over a period of five years 
as part of the settlement  intermune also entered into corporate integrity and deferred prosecution agreements with the government 
restructuring charges effective march   we made the decision to discontinue the phase iii inspire clinical trial evaluating actimmune in patients with ipf based upon the recommendation of the study s independent data monitoring committee 
as a result of the disappointing inspire trial results  we made the decision to reduce our workforce by approximately  which has been completed as of september  as a result  we incurred approximately million in personnel related restructuring charges during the million charge is comprised of approximately million for cash severance and related benefits and million of costs for the acceleration of options for approximately  shares of our common stock

discontinued operations in consist primarily of transition related services  including product returns  which were substantially completed at the end of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes the million tax benefit recorded in primarily relates to net operating losses that we concluded are realizable based on our estimate of future taxable income resulting from future potential sales of our shares of targanta common stock 
due to our continuing operating losses and the uncertainty of our recognizing the potential future benefits from the remaining non operating losses  we recorded no provision for income taxes for the year ended december  as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through if not utilized 
we also have federal research and development tax credits of approximately million that will expire in the years through in addition  we had net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes of approximately million that expire in the years through and state research and development tax credits of approximately million that do not expire 
utilization of the net operating losses may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization

we initially expensed this amount as acquired research and development as oritavancin at the time was in clinical development  had not reached technical feasibility and had no foreseeable alternative future uses 
in connection with the divestiture of oritavancin to targanta in december  we received a waiver from eli lilly for making this payment and reversed the accrued liability and related expense for this milestone in general and administrative expenses g a expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or 
g a expense also includes million of stock based compensation expense in  reflecting the adoption of sfas r 
the decreased spending for the year ended december  compared to the same period in was largely the result of the reductions in field based ipf disease awareness activities and a decrease in the number of personnel in the home office  as announced in november restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved a restructuring plan recommended by our chief executive officer and senior management that was designed to help streamline our operations and reduce our operating expenses in the plan  which consisted of a significant reduction in our investment in field based ipf disease awareness activities  was implemented concurrently with the divestiture of infergen in december these combined actions led to a significant headcount reduction of approximately employees and resulting termination costs of approximately million 
restructuring charges comprised approximately million of this amount which were recorded as a separate component of operating expenses in the statement of operations  with the remainder allocated to discontinued operations 
see loss from discontinued operations discussion below 
the majority of the employees left intermune at the end of the fourth quarter of and the remainder during the first quarter of the million restructuring charge was comprised of approximately million for cash severance and related benefits and approximately million for non cash stock compensation  consisting of an allocation of option acceleration costs for approximately  shares of our common stock

the loss in also included employee termination costs of approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
gain on sale of discontinued operations the gain on sale of discontinued operations in was comprised of the million in cash proceeds and a million note received from valeant in connection with the sale of infergen  offset by the net book value of the assets sold and direct transaction costs 
these assets included intellectual property rights  payments to a contract manufacturer  and inventory with a net book value of approximately million at the time of the transaction 
in addition  we incurred approximately million of direct transaction costs related to the sale of infergen 
provision for income taxes due to our continuing operating losses and the uncertainty of our recognizing the potential future benefits from these losses  we recorded no provision or benefit for income taxes for the years ended december  and liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of million compared to million at december  the increase was primarily the result of the completion of a public stock offering during in which we received net proceeds of approximately million and the receipt of million from our collaboration partner roche  partially offset by operating losses 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximize yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us federal and state governments and their agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure by imposing concentration limits and credit worthiness requirements for all corporate issuers 
at december   we held approximately million of municipal notes investments  classified as current assets  with an auction reset feature auction rate securities whose underlying assets are generally student loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
through march   auctions failed for million of our auction rate securities and as a result our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 

table of contents operating activities cash used in operating activities was million during the year ended december   comprised primarily of a net loss of million 
this use of cash is net of a million increase to deferred revenue as a result of a million milestone received january from roche under the collaboration agreement  stock based compensation expense of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
the decrease in accounts receivable is primarily due to the continuing decline in actimmune sales resulting from the disappointing inspire trial results announced march details concerning the loss from operations can be found above in this report under the heading results of operations 
investing activities investing activities used million in cash flows during the year ended december   primarily due to investment purchases of million  of which a portion were made upon completion of our public stock offering 
we also had maturities and sales of available for sale securities totaling million  which partially offset the purchases during the year 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to the million in net proceeds from the public stock offering and to a lesser extent the issuance of our common stock under our employee stock plans 
we believe that we will continue to require substantial additional funding to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our product candidates 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  together with anticipated cash flows from our operations  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  settlement with the government  debt obligations and capital requirements under our current business plan through at least the end of however  this forward looking statement involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed under item a 
risk factors 
this forward looking statement is also based upon our current plans and assumptions  which may change  and our capital requirements  which may increase in future periods 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to sales of actimmune or any of our product candidates in development that receive commercial approval  our ability to partner our programs or products  the progress of our research and development efforts  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the costs  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  determinations as to the commercial potential of our product candidates in development  the pace of expansion of administrative expenses  the status of competitive products and competitive barriers to entry  the establishment and maintenance of manufacturing capacity through third party manufacturing agreements  the establishment of collaborative relationships with other companies  the payments of annual interest on our long term debt  the payments related to the civil settlement agreement with the government  the timing and size of the payments we may receive from roche pursuant to the collaboration agreement  and whether we must repay the principal in connection with our convertible debt obligations 

table of contents as a result  we may require additional funds and may attempt to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or from other sources 
we have no commitments for such fund raising activities at this time 
additional funding may not be available to finance our operations when needed or  if available  the terms for obtaining such funds may not be favorable or may result in dilution to our stockholders 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities that are unconsolidated in our financial statements 
we have no commercial commitments or loans with related parties 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities  such as milestone payments  for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments 
the following chart represents our contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type in millions contractual obligations total after long term debt obligations government settlement operating leases non cancelable purchase obligations other research and development commitments total contractual cash obligations these amounts include accrued interest and the principal amount of the convertible senior notes due these amounts consist of clinical  process development and marketing related obligations 
these amounts consist of clinical related obligations and are cancelable upon discontinuation of the trial 
they do not include any amounts related to the collaboration agreement with roche given the inherent difficulties in the estimation process 
the operating leases for our facilities require letters of credit secured by a restricted cash balance with our bank 
the amount of each letter of credit approximates six to twelve months of operating rent payable to the landlord of each facility 
recent accounting pronouncements at its december meeting  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf in issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property 
the eitf concluded that a collaborative arrangement is one in which the participants are actively involved and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the ultimate commercial success of the endeavor 
revenues and costs incurred with third parties in connection with collaborative arrangements would be presented gross or net based on the criteria in eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and other accounting literature 
payments to or from collaborators would be evaluated and presented based on the nature of the arrangement and its terms  the nature of the entity s business and whether those payments are within the scope of other accounting literature 
the nature and purpose of collaborative arrangements are to be disclosed along with the accounting policies and the classification and amounts of significant financial statement amounts related to the arrangements 
activities in the arrangement conducted in a separate legal entity should be accounted for under other accounting literature  however  required disclosure under eitf applies to the entire collaborative agreement 
this issue is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
we are currently in the process of 
table of contents evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement and have not determined whether it will have a material impact  but its adoption would not affect reported amounts of net loss 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force on issue no 
eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate and market risk the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are  due to their short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a change in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including obligations of us government sponsored enterprises  municipal notes which may have an auction reset feature  corporate notes and bonds  commercial paper  and money market funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
substantially all investments mature within approximately years from the date of purchase 
our holdings of the securities of any one issuer  except obligations of us government sponsored enterprises  do not exceed of the portfolio 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risks 
at december   we held approximately million of municipal notes investments  classified as current assets  with an auction reset feature auction rate securities whose underlying assets are generally student 
table of contents loans which are substantially backed by the federal government 
through march   auctions failed for million of our auction rate securities and as a result our ability to liquidate our investment and fully recover the carrying value of our investment in the near term may be limited or not exist 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not 
all of our auction rate securities are currently rated aaa  the highest rating by a rating agency 
if the issuers are unable to successfully close future auctions and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an impairment charge on these investments 
we currently believe these securities are not significantly impaired  primarily due to the government guarantee of the underlying securities  however  it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments recorded value 
based on our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the potential lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december  by effective maturity in millions  except percentages fair value at and december  beyond total assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities convertible senior notes due average interest rate the table below presents the principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of december  by effective maturity in millions  except percentages fair value at and december  beyond total assets available for sale securities average interest rate liabilities convertible senior notes due average interest rate foreign currency market risk we purchase commercial and clinical products from bi and settle our obligations in a foreign currency 
this exposes us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
to protect against currency exchange risks on forecasted foreign currency cash payments for the purchases of actimmune from bi over the next year  we have considered instituting a foreign currency cash flow hedging program 
in the past  we have hedged portions of our forecasted foreign currency cash payments with forward contracts 
when the dollar strengthens significantly against the foreign currencies  the decline in the value of future foreign currency expenses is offset by losses in the value of the option or forward contracts designated as hedges 
conversely  when the dollar weakens  the increase in the value of future foreign currency expenses is offset by gains in the value of the forward contracts 
in  we used foreign currency forward contracts to partially mitigate this exposure  but did not enter into any new foreign currency forward contracts in  or we regularly evaluate the cost benefit of entering into such arrangements  and presently have no foreign currency hedge agreements outstanding
