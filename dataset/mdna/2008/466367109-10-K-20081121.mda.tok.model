overview as of september   jack in the box inc the company owned  operated  and franchised  jack in the box quick service restaurants and qdoba mexican grill qdoba fast casual restaurants  primarily in the western and southern united states 
our primary source of revenue is from retail sales at company operated restaurants 
we also derive revenue from sales of food and packaging to jack in the box and qdoba franchises  and revenue from franchisees including royalties based upon a percent of sales  franchise fees and rents 
in addition  we recognize gains from the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees  which are presented as a reduction of operating costs and expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
the quick service restaurant industry is complex and challenging 
challenges presently facing the sector include higher levels of consumer expectations  intense competition with respect to market share  restaurant locations  labor  menu and product development  changes in the economy  including costs of commodities  and trends for healthier eating 
to address these challenges and others  management has developed a strategic plan focused on four key initiatives 
the first initiative is a growth strategy that includes opening new restaurants and increasing same store sales 
the second initiative is a holistic reinvention of the jack in the box brand through menu innovation  upgrading guest service and re imaging jack in the box restaurant facilities to reflect the personality of jack the chain s fictional founder and popular spokesman 
the third strategic initiative is to expand franchising through new restaurant development and the sales of company operated restaurants to franchisees to create a business model that is less capital intensive and not as susceptible to cost fluctuations 
the fourth initiative is to improve our business model as we transition to becoming a predominantly franchised restaurant chain 

table of contents the following summarizes the most significant events occurring in fiscal restaurant sales 
jack in the box company operated restaurants open more than one year same store sales increased year to date  on top of an increase of a year ago 
system same store sales at qdoba restaurants increased year to date  on top of an increase of a year ago 
sales and traffic at both concepts continue to be impacted by the current economic environment  including higher unemployment rates  and for much of the fiscal year significantly higher gas prices  and consumers who have become more conservative in their discretionary spending 
commodity costs 
our business continues to be impacted by pressures from increased commodity costs 
in  food and packaging costs were basis points higher than last year 
beef costs  which represent the company s largest single commodity expense  increased by more than percent and higher costs for cheese  shortening and potato items contributed to a increase in overall commodity costs for the year 
new market expansion 
we expanded into a new contiguous company market in denver  colorado  opening three jack in the box restaurants  and we opened our third restaurant in corpus christi  texas  a new market we entered at the end of last fiscal year 
jack in the box franchisees are also expanding into new contiguous markets in texas opening four restaurants in san angelo  midland  sweetwater and odessa 
franchisees are expected to continue expanding jack in the box into new contiguous markets in fiscal  with locations scheduled to open in colorado springs  colorado  albuquerque  new mexico  and wichita falls  texas 
re image program 
we continued to re image our jack in the box restaurants with a comprehensive program that includes a redesign of the dining room and common areas 
in  the company and its franchisees re imaged restaurants 
since the current program was adopted in  approximately company and franchised restaurants  or more than one third of the system  have been re imaged 
we are accelerating the pace at which we will complete the exterior enhancements of our re image program and by the end of fiscal  the exteriors of all company and franchised restaurants are expected to be re imaged 
interior elements of the re image program  including a complete redesign of dining rooms and common areas  are on schedule to be completed system wide by the end of fiscal franchising program 
we continued to execute our strategic initiative to expand franchising through new restaurant development and sales of company operated restaurants to franchisees and at september   approximately of our jack in the box restaurants were franchised 
our long term goal is to grow the percentage of franchise ownership of the jack in the box system to  which should create a business model that is less capital intensive and not as susceptible to cost fluctuations and is more closely aligned with that of the qsr industry 
while the lending environment is currently much more difficult than we have seen in the past  we plan to accelerate the pace of our refranchising efforts over the next years  which should allow us to reach our franchise ownership goals by the end of fiscal treasury highlights 
pursuant to a stock repurchase program authorized by our board of directors  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for an aggregate of million during the first three quarters of fiscal due to uncertainty in the financial markets and the availability of credit prior to approval of the federal bailout plan  we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in the fourth quarter and we chose to draw down additional funds under our revolving credit facility prior to fiscal year end 
discontinued operations 
in september  the board of directors approved plans to sell our quick stuff convenience stores to maximize the potential of the jack in the box and qdoba brands 
financial reporting changes in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded adjustments to goodwill in connection with the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees from the beginning of fiscal through the second quarter of fiscal historically  we did not write off goodwill on the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees  as we did not believe it constituted the disposal of a business under the provisions of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
it has now been interpreted that sfas requires that a portion of the entity level goodwill be written off based on the relative fair values of the restaurants being sold and the remaining value of the entity  in our 
table of contents case  jack in the box 
these adjustments did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements for any of the affected reporting periods

sg a expenses decreased to approximately of revenues in from of revenues in and in the decrease in is due primarily to effective management of field and corporate general and administrative expenses  the impact of our refranchising strategy  lower incentive compensation and leverage from higher revenues 
these decreases were offset in part by losses on the cash surrender value of insurance products used to fund certain non qualified retirement plans  losses related to hurricanes and an increase in facility charges related to the jack in the box re image program  the kitchen enhancement project and the impairment of seven restaurants we continue to operate 
in  increased leverage from higher revenues  lower pension costs and insurance recoveries contributed to the percent of revenue decline compared with gains on the sale of company operated restaurants were million  million and million in  and  respectively

cumulative effect of accounting change in fiscal  we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation fin which requires that we record a liability for an asset retirement obligation at the end of a lease if the amount can be reasonably estimated 
as a result of adopting fin  we recorded an after tax cumulative effect from this accounting change of million related to the depreciation and interest expense that would have been charged prior to the adoption 
liquidity and capital resources general 
our primary sources of short term and long term liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations  the revolving bank credit facility  the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees and the sale and leaseback of certain restaurant properties 
our cash requirements consist principally of working capital  capital expenditures for new restaurant construction  restaurant renovations and upgrades of our management information systems  income tax payments  debt service requirements  and obligations related to our benefit plans 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditure  working capital and debt service requirements 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories and our vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
as a result  we typically maintain current liabilities in excess of current assets that result in a working capital deficit 
cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at september  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
this increase is primarily due to borrowings under our credit facility  cash flows provided by operating activities and from the sale of restaurants to franchisees 
we generally reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new restaurants or enhance existing restaurants  to repurchase shares of our common stock and to reduce debt 

table of contents cash flows

the cash flows for our quick stuff discontinued operations are not material to our consolidated statements of cash flows 
in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities

in  operating cash flow decreased million to million compared with primarily due to an increase in income tax payments 
investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in compared to million in increasing primarily due to higher capital expenditures offset in part by an increase in proceeds from the sale of company operated restaurants to franchisees 
cash flows used in investing activities increased in compared with primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from assets held for sale and leaseback  higher capital expenditures and cash used in to acquire nine qdoba restaurants previously operated by franchisees 
capital expenditures 
our capital expenditure program includes  among other things  investments in new locations  restaurant remodeling  new equipment  and information technology enhancements 
we used cash of million for purchases of property and equipment in compared with million in and million in the increase in capital expenditures in each year primarily relates to a kitchen enhancement project  our on going comprehensive re image program and  in  the purchase of our smoothie equipment 
the kitchen enhancements are expected to increase restaurant capacity for new product introductions while also reducing utility expense using energy efficient equipment 
the re image program is an important part of the chain s holistic brand reinvention initiative and is intended to create a warm and inviting dining experience for jack in the box guests 
in fiscal  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million  including investment costs related to the jack in the box restaurant re image program 
we plan to open approximately new jack in the box and new qdoba company operated restaurants in sale of company operated restaurants 
we have continued our strategy of selectively selling jack in the box company operated restaurants to franchisees 
in  we generated cash proceeds and notes receivable of million from the sale of restaurants compared with cash proceeds of million in from the sale of restaurants and million in from the sale of restaurants 
fiscal includes million of short term financing provided to facilitate the closing of our fourth quarter transactions  while franchisees completed the loan process with their lenders 
acquisition of franchise operated restaurants 
in the third quarter of  qdoba acquired nine franchise operated restaurants for approximately million in cash 
the primary assets acquired include million in net property and equipment and million in goodwill 
financing activities 
cash used in financing activities decreased million to million in  compared with  primarily attributable to a decrease in share repurchases and proceeds from the issuance of common stock  offset in part by a decrease in credit facility borrowings 
cash used in financing activities increased in  compared with  due primarily to an increase in stock repurchases and term loan principal payments  offset in part by proceeds received related to our new credit facility 

table of contents financing 
our credit facility is comprised of i a million revolving credit facility maturing on december  and ii a term loan maturing on december   both bearing interest at london interbank offered rate libor plus 
at inception  we borrowed million under the term loan facility and used the proceeds to repay all borrowings under the prior credit facility  to pay related transaction fees and expenses and to repurchase a portion of our outstanding stock 
we subsequently elected to make  without penalty  a million optional prepayment of our term loan in  which has been applied to the remaining scheduled principal installments in the direct order of maturity 
at september   we had borrowings under the revolving credit facility of million  million outstanding under the term loan and had letters of credit outstanding of million 
as part of the credit agreement  we may also request the issuance of up to million in letters of credit  the outstanding amount of which reduces the net borrowing capacity under the agreement 
the credit facility requires the payment of an annual commitment fee based on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the credit facility s interest rates and the annual commitment rate are based on a financial leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by first priority liens and security interests in the capital stock  partnership  and membership interests owned by us and or our subsidiaries  and any proceeds thereof  subject to certain restrictions set forth in the credit agreement 
additionally  the credit agreement includes a negative pledge on all tangible and intangible assets including all real and personal property with customary exceptions 
loan origination costs associated with the new credit facility were million and are included as deferred costs in other assets  net in the consolidated balance sheet 
deferred financing fees of million related to the prior credit facility were written off in the first quarter of and are included in interest expense  net in the consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended september  interest rate swaps 
concurrent with the termination of our prior credit facility  we liquidated three swap agreements and reversed the fair value of the swaps recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss  net 
to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates under our credit facility  in march  we entered into two interest rate swap agreements that will effectively convert million of our variable rate term loan borrowings to a fixed rate basis for three years 
debt covenants 
we are subject to a number of covenants under our various debt instruments  including limitations on additional borrowings  acquisitions  loans to franchisees  capital expenditures  lease commitments  stock repurchases and dividend payments  as well as requirements to maintain certain financial ratios  cash flows and net worth 
as of september   we complied with all debt covenants 
debt outstanding 
total debt outstanding increased to million at september  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
current maturities of long term debt decreased million and long term debt  net of current maturities increased million due to borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
given the uncertainty surrounding the liquidity and stability of the credit markets  we elected to maintain approximately million of additional borrowings under our revolving credit facility at september  repurchases of common stock 
in november  the board approved a program to repurchase up to million in shares of our common stock over three years expiring november  we repurchased million shares at an aggregate cost of million during fiscal as of september   the total remaining amount authorized for repurchase was million

table of contents pursuant to a stock repurchase program authorized by the board of directors in  we repurchased million and million shares of our common stock for million and million during and  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements 
other than operating leases  we are not a party to any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future material effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
we finance a portion of our new restaurant development through sale leaseback transactions 
these transactions involve selling restaurants to unrelated parties and leasing the restaurants back 
additional information regarding our operating leases is available in item  properties  and note  leases  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and commitments 
the following is a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  in thousands payments due by year less than after total year years years years contractual obligations credit facility term loan revolving credit facility capital lease obligations other long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase commitments benefit obligations total contractual obligations other commercial commitments stand by letters of credit obligations related to our credit facility  capital lease obligations  and other long term debt obligations include interest expense estimated at interest rates in effect on september  includes purchase commitments for food  beverage  packaging items and certain utilities 
includes expected payments associated with our defined benefit plans  postretirement benefit plans and our non qualified deferred compensation plan through fiscal consists primarily of letters of credit for workers compensation and general liability insurance 
discussion of critical accounting estimates we have identified the following as our most critical accounting estimates  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective and complex judgments 
information regarding our other significant accounting estimates and policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
under the provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by an option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the option pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 

table of contents retirement benefits we sponsor pension and other retirement plans in various forms covering those employees who meet certain eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans  including assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and the rate of increase in compensation levels  as determined by us using specified guidelines 
in addition  our outside actuarial consultants also use certain statistical factors such as turnover  retirement and mortality rates to estimate our future benefit obligations 
the actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower turnover and retirement rates or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may affect the amount of pension expense we record 
self insurance we are self insured for a portion of our losses related to workers compensation  general liability  automotive  medical and dental programs 
in estimating our self insurance accruals  we utilize independent actuarial estimates of expected losses  which are based on statistical analysis of historical data 
these assumptions are closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was expected  accruals might not be sufficient  and additional expense may be recorded 
long lived assets property  equipment and certain other assets  including amortized intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present 
this review includes a restaurant level analysis that takes into consideration a restaurant s operating cash flows  the period of time since a restaurant has been opened or remodeled  refranchising expectations  and the maturity of the related market 
when indicators of impairment are present  we perform an impairment analysis on a restaurant by restaurant basis 
if the sum of undiscounted future cash flows is less than the net carrying value of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss by the amount which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
our estimates of future cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
goodwill and other intangibles we also evaluate goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
if the determined fair values of these assets are less than the related carrying amounts  an impairment loss is recognized 
the methods we use to estimate fair value include future cash flow assumptions  which may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions or changes in operating performance 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reviewed the carrying value of our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets and determined that no impairment existed as of september  allowances for doubtful accounts our trade receivables consist primarily of amounts due from franchisees for rents on subleased sites  royalties and distribution sales 
we continually monitor amounts due from franchisees and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses 
this estimate is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific franchisee accounts  as well as a general allowance based on historical trends  the financial condition of our franchisees  consideration of the general economy and the aging of such receivables 
we have good relationships with our franchisees and high collection rates  however  if the future financial condition of our franchisees were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make specific required payments  we may be required to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
legal accruals the company is subject to claims and lawsuits in the ordinary course of its business 
a determination of the amount accrued  if any  for these contingencies is made after analysis of each matter 
we continually evaluate such accruals and may increase or decrease accrued amounts  as we deem appropriate 
future application of accounting principles in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas clarifies the definition of fair value  describes methods used to appropriately measure fair value  and expands fair value disclosure requirements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that currently require or permit fair value measurements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those years 
however  the effective date of sfas as it relates to fair value measurement requirements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis is deferred to fiscal years 
table of contents beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
we are currently in the process of assessing the impact that sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
in fiscal  we adopted the recognition provisions of sfas  which requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit plan as an asset or liability 
sfas also requires that companies measure their plan assets and benefit obligations at the end of their fiscal year 
the measurement provision of sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we will not be able to determine the impact of adopting the measurement provision of sfas until the end of the fiscal year when such valuation is completed 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits entities to voluntarily choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently in the process of determining whether to elect the fair value measurement options available under this standard 
in march  the fasb issued sfas  disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends sfas and expands disclosures to include information about the fair value of derivatives  related credit risks and a company s strategies and objectives for using derivatives 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after november  we are currently in the process of assessing the impact that sfas will have on the disclosures in our consolidated financial statements 
other accounting standards that have been issued or proposed by the fasb or other standards setting bodies that do not require adoption until a future date are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to risks relating to financial instruments is changes in interest rates 
our credit facility  which is comprised of a revolving credit facility and a term loan  bears interest at an annual rate equal to the prime rate or libor plus an applicable margin based on a financial leverage ratio 
as of september   the applicable margin for the libor based revolving loans and term loan was set at we use interest rate swap agreements to reduce exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
at september   we had two interest rate swap agreements having an aggregate notional amount of million expiring april  these agreements effectively convert a portion of our variable rate bank debt to fixed rate debt and have an average pay rate of  yielding a fixed rate of including the term loan s applicable margin of 
a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates  based on the outstanding unhedged balance of our revolving credit facility and term loan at september  would result in an estimated increase of million in annual interest expense 
changes in interest rates also impact our pension expense  as do changes in the expected long term rate of return on our pension plan assets 
an assumed discount rate is used in determining the present value of future cash outflows currently expected to be required to satisfy the pension benefit obligation when due 
additionally  an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is used in determining the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide the benefits to meet our projected benefit obligation 
a hypothetical basis point reduction in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets would have resulted in an estimated increase of million and million  respectively  in our annual pension expense 
we are also exposed to the impact of commodity and utility price fluctuations related to unpredictable factors such as weather and various other market conditions outside our control 
our ability to recover increased costs through higher prices is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
from time to time  we enter into futures and option contracts to manage these fluctuations 
at september   we had five monthly natural gas swap agreements in place that represent approximately of our total requirements for natural gas for the months of november through march at september   we had no other material financial instruments subject to significant market exposure
