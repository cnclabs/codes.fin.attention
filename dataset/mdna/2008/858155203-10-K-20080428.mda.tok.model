the largest independent dealer in north america accounted for approximately of our segment revenue in the five largest independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately of our segment revenue 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer  the loss of which would have a sustained material adverse effect upon our business 
however  temporary disruption of dealer coverage within a specific local market due to financial failure  the inability to smoothly transition ownership or termination of the dealer relationship could temporarily have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market 
from time to time  we obtain a controlling interest in dealers that are undergoing an ownership transition 
it is typically our intent to divest our interest in these dealerships as soon as it is practical 
in  the north america segment had revenue of  or of our consolidated revenue  and at the end of the year had approximately  employees and temporary workers 
approximately  of the total workers related to manufacturing 
the north america office furniture markets are highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar categories of products 
in these markets  companies compete on price  product performance  design  delivery and relationships with customers  architects and designers 
our most significant competitors in the us are haworth  inc  herman miller  inc  hni corporation  kimball international inc 
and knoll  inc together with steelcase  these companies represent approximately of the us office furniture market 
international segment our international segment serves customers outside of the us and canada primarily under the steelcase brand  with an emphasis on freestanding furniture systems  storage and seating solutions 
the international office furniture market is highly competitive and fragmented 
we compete with many local and regional manufacturers in many different markets 
in many cases  these competitors focus on specific product categories 
our largest presence is in europe  where we have the leading market share in germany  france and spain 
we serve customers through approximately independent and company owned dealers 
in certain geographic markets we sell directly to end customers 
no single independent dealer in the international segment accounted for more than of our segment revenue in the five largest independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately of our segment revenue 
during  we acquired of the outstanding stock of ultra group company limited ultra 
ultra is an office furniture manufacturer with headquarters in hong kong  manufacturing in china and sales and distribution throughout asia 
in  our international segment had revenue of  or of our consolidated revenue  and at the end of the year had approximately  employees and temporary workers 
approximately  of the total workers related to manufacturing 
other category the other category includes our premium group formerly design group  polyvision  ideo  and  through  financial services business 

table of contents the premium group is comprised of the following four brands focused on providing architects and designers with unique products and premium experiences 
designtex focuses on surface materials including textiles  wall coverings  shades  screens and surface imagings 
vecta designs and creates learning  meeting and teaming environments 
brayton focuses on lounge and executive seating and tables 
metro creates refined  modern furniture for meeting spaces  private offices and the open floor plan 
designtex primarily sells products specified by architects and designers directly to end use customers through a direct sales force 
vecta  brayton and metro sales are primarily generated through our north america dealer network 
polyvision designs and manufactures visual communication products  such as static and electronic whiteboards 
the majority of polyvision s revenue relates to the manufacturing of steel and ceramic surfaces and the fabrication of related static whiteboards sold in the primary and secondary education markets 
polyvision s revenue generated from whiteboards and group communication tools are sold through audio visual resellers and our north america dealer network 
polyvision also sells fabricated static whiteboards to general contractors through a direct bid process  however  we intend to exit this portion of the business during ideo is an innovation and design firm that uses a human centered  design based approach to generate new offerings and build new capabilities for its customers 
ideo serves steelcase and a variety of organizations within consumer products  financial services  healthcare  information technology  government  transportation and other industries 
in  we entered into an agreement which will allow certain members of the management of ideo to potentially purchase a controlling equity interest in ideo in two phases before as of february   ideo management effectively purchased approximately of ideo under the first phase of the agreement 
in  the other category accounted for  or of our total revenue  and at the end of the year had approximately  employees and temporary workers 
approximately  of the total workers related to manufacturing 
corporate expenses approximately of corporate expenses are charged to the operating segments as part of a corporate allocation 
unallocated corporate expenses are reported as corporate 
corporate costs include executive and portions of shared service functions such as information technology  human resources  finance  legal  research and development and corporate facilities 
joint ventures we enter into joint ventures from time to time to expand our geographic presence  support our distribution network or invest in complementary products and services 
as of february   our investment in these unconsolidated joint ventures was our portion of the income or loss from the joint ventures is recorded in other income  net on the consolidated statements of income 
customer and dealer concentrations our largest direct sale customer accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue in and our five largest direct sale customers accounted for approximately of consolidated revenue 
however  these percentages do not include revenue from various government agencies and other entities purchasing under our us general services administration contract  which in the aggregate accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single or small number of end use customers  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on our business 

table of contents no single independent dealer accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue for the five largest independent dealers collectively accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue 
working capital our accounts receivable are primarily from our dealers  and to a lesser degree  direct sale customers 
payment terms vary by country and region 
the terms of our north america segment  and certain markets within the international segment  encourage prompt payment by offering a discount 
other international markets have  by market convention  longer payment terms 
we are not aware of any special or unusual practices or conditions related to working capital items  including accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable  which are significant to understanding our business or the industry at large 
backlog our products are generally manufactured and shipped within four to six weeks following receipt of order  therefore  we do not view the amount of backlog at any particular time as a meaningful indicator of longer term shipments 
global manufacturing and supply chain manufacturing and logistics we have manufacturing operations throughout north america  europe principally in france  germany and spain and in asia 
in order to serve the growth needs of our asian market  we continue to expand production in our plants in kuala lumpur  malaysia and in shenzhen  china  and we acquired additional capacity in zhaoqing  china in as a result of the ultra acquisition 
we have evolved our manufacturing and supply chain systems significantly over the past several years by implementing lean manufacturing principles 
in particular  we have focused on implementing continuous one piece flow  streamlining our product offerings and developing a global network of integrated suppliers 
anything which cannot be part of one piece flow may be evaluated to see whether outside partners would offer better levels of service  quality and cost 
our global manufacturing operations are centralized under a single organization to serve our customers needs across multiple brands and geographies 
this approach has reduced the capital needs of our business  reduced inventories and reduced the footprint of our manufacturing space while at the same time  allowing us to improve quality  delivery performance and the customer experience 
we continue to identify opportunities to eliminate excess capacity and redundancy while continuing to focus on our growth strategies 
we recently announced that we will be closing three us manufacturing facilities in and relocating the majority of their operations to other manufacturing facilities 
in addition to our continued focus on enhancing the efficiency of our manufacturing operations  we also seek to reduce costs through our global sourcing effort 
we have capitalized on raw material and component cost savings available through lower cost suppliers around the globe 
this global view of potential sources of supply has enhanced our leverage with domestic supply sources  and we have been able to reduce cycle times through improvements from all levels throughout the supply chain 
our physical distribution system utilizes dedicated fleet  commercial transport and company owned delivery services 
over the past several years  we have implemented a network of regional distribution centers to reduce freight costs and improve service to our dealers and customers 
some of these distribution centers are located within our manufacturing facilities  and we have contracted with third party logistics providers to operate some of these regional distribution centers 

table of contents raw materials and energy prices we source raw materials and components from a significant number of suppliers around the world 
those raw materials include steel and other metals  plastics  wood  fabrics  paint  packaging  acoustical materials  foam  veneers  laminates  glass and leather 
to date  we have not experienced any significant difficulties in obtaining these raw materials 
the prices for certain commodities such as steel  aluminum  wood  particleboard and petroleum based products have fluctuated in recent years due to changes in global supply and demand 
our global supply chain team continually evaluates market conditions and supply options on the basis of cost  quality and reliability of supply 
research  design and development our extensive global research a combination of user observations  feedback sessions and sophisticated network analysis has helped us develop unique expertise in helping people work more effectively 
we team up with external world class innovators  including leading universities  think tanks and knowledge leaders  to expand and deepen our understanding of how people work 
understanding patterns of work enables us to identify and anticipate user needs across the globe 
our design teams explore and develop prototypical solutions to address these needs 
these solutions vary from furniture  architecture and technology solutions to single products or enhancements to existing products and different vertical market applications such as healthcare  higher education and professional services 
organizationally  design responsibility is distributed globally across our major businesses and may involve external design services 
our marketing team evaluates product concepts using several criteria  including financial return metrics  and chooses which products will be developed and launched 
designers then work closely with our engineers and external suppliers to co develop products and processes that lead to more efficient manufacturing while incorporating innovative user features 
products are tested for performance  quality and compliance with applicable standards and regulations 
exclusive of royalty payments  we invested in research  design and development activities over the past three years 
we continue to invest approximately one to two percent of our revenue in research  design and development each year 
royalties are sometimes paid to external designers of our products as the products are sold 
these costs are not included in the research  design and development costs since they are variable  based on product sales 
intellectual property we generate and hold a significant number of patents in a number of countries in connection with the operation of our business 
we also hold a number of trademarks that are very important to our identity and recognition in the marketplace 
we do not believe that any material part of our business is dependent on the continued availability of any one or all of our patents or trademarks  or that our business would be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of such  except the steelcase  turnstone  polyvision  designtex and ideo trademarks 
we occasionally enter into license agreements under which we pay a royalty to third parties for the use of patented products  designs or process technology 
we have established a global network of intellectual property licenses with our subsidiaries 
we also selectively license our intellectual property to third parties as a revenue source 
employees as of february   we had approximately  employees including  hourly employees and  salaried employees 
additionally  we had  temporary workers who primarily work in manufacturing 
approximately employees in the us are covered by collective bargaining 
table of contents agreements 
internationally  a significant number of employees are covered by workers councils that operate to promote the interests of workers 
management believes we continue to maintain positive relations with our employees 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment environmental laws 
we believe our operations are in substantial compliance with all environmental laws 
we do not believe existing environmental laws and regulations have had or will have any material effects upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
under certain environmental laws  we could be held liable  without regard to fault  for the costs of remediation associated with our existing or historical operations 
we could also be held responsible for third party property and personal injury claims or for violations of environmental laws relating to contamination 
we are a party to  or otherwise involved in  proceedings relating to several contaminated properties being investigated and remediated under environmental laws  including as a potentially responsible party in several superfund site cleanups 
based on our information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties  other financially viable potentially responsible parties and the total estimated cleanup costs  we do not believe the costs to us associated with these properties will be material  either individually or in the aggregate 
we have established reserves that we believe are adequate to cover our anticipated remediation costs 
however  certain events could cause our actual costs to vary from the established reserves 
these events include  but are not limited to a change in governmental regulations or cleanup standards or requirements  undiscovered information regarding the nature and volume of wastes allegedly disposed of or released at these properties  and other factors increasing the cost of remediation or the loss of other potentially responsible parties that are financially capable of contributing toward cleanup costs

item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also adversely affect our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
if any of the 
table of contents following risks actually occur  our business  operating results  cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
business cycles and other changes in demand could adversely impact our revenue and profits 
office furniture industry revenues are impacted by a variety of cyclical macroeconomic factors such as corporate profits  non residential fixed investment  white collar employment growth and commercial office construction 
our product sales are directly tied to corporate capital spending  which is outside of our control 
geopolitical uncertainties  terrorist attacks  acts of war  natural disasters  other world events or combinations of such and other factors that are outside of our control could also have a significant effect on business confidence and the global economy and therefore  our business 
other demand influences on our industry include technology changes  organizational changes  employee health and safety concerns and the globalization of companies 
the trend towards outsourcing white collar jobs could cause our major customers in our core markets to shift employment growth to countries where our market share is not as strong 
if we are unsuccessful in adapting our business to these changes and trends  our revenues and profits may be adversely impacted 
we may not be able to successfully implement and manage our growth strategies 
our growth strategies call for expansion in existing markets by leveraging our current distribution to win new customers and more fully serve existing customers and their installed base of our products  and new adjacent markets such as the mid market segment of the office furniture market firms with to employees  vertical markets such as healthcare and higher education and emerging international markets with multiple or alternate channels 
we believe our future success depends upon our ability to deliver a great experience to our customers  which includes innovative  well made products and world class processes 
our success relies in part on our research and development and engineering efforts  our ability to manufacture or source the products and customer acceptance of our products 
as it relates to new markets  our success also depends on our ability to create and implement local supply chain and distribution strategies to reach these markets 
the potential inability to successfully implement and manage our growth strategy could adversely affect our business and our results of operations 
the successful implementation of our growth strategy will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain a skilled workforce 
the increasing competition for highly skilled and talented employees could result in higher compensation costs  difficulties in maintaining a capable workforce and leadership succession planning challenges 
our efforts to grow our business in emerging markets are subject to the risk factors listed below relating to our global operations but also include other risks 
in certain markets in asia and eastern europe where we are expanding our business  the legal and political environment can be unstable and uncertain which could make it difficult for us to compete successfully and to protect our investments or sell our investments in the future 
as we hire new people and establish new processes in these locations  we are implementing our global business standards  but there is some risk our activities could expose us to liabilities 
we also make investments in new business development initiatives which  like many startups  could have a relatively high failure rate 
we limit our investments in these initiatives and establish governance procedures to contain the associated risks  but losses could result and may be material 
our growth strategy also may involve acquisitions  joint venture alliances and additional channels of distribution 
we may not be able to enter into acquisitions or joint venture arrangements on acceptable terms  and we may not successfully integrate these activities into our operations 
we also may not be 
table of contents successful in implementing new distribution channels  and changes could create discord in our existing channels of distribution 
we could be adversely affected by increasing raw material and commodity costs 
we procure raw materials from a significant number of sources within the us  canada  mexico  europe and asia 
these raw materials are not rare or unique to our industry 
the absolute level and volatility in steel  aluminum  wood  particleboard  petroleum based products  and other commodity costs  such as fuel and energy  have significantly increased in recent years due to changes in global supply and demand 
these changes could also lead to supply interruptions 
our gross margins could be affected if these types of costs remain high or escalate further 
in the short term  rapid changes in raw material costs can be very difficult to offset because of price hold agreements we have entered into with our customers 
it is difficult to find effective financial instruments to hedge against these risks 
we may not be successful in passing along a portion of the higher raw materials costs to our customers because of competitive pressures 
disruptions to the supply of raw materials  component parts and labor in our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our supply chain management 
we are reliant on the timely flow of raw materials and components from third party suppliers and our own manufacturing operations 
the flow of such materials and components may be affected by fluctuations in the availability and quality of the raw materials  damage and loss or disruption of production from accidents  natural disasters and other causes  and disruptions caused by labor activities 
we continue to migrate to a less vertically integrated manufacturing model  which will increase our reliance on an international network of suppliers 
any disruptions in the supply and delivery of component parts and products or deficiencies in our ability to develop and manage our network of suppliers could have an adverse impact on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we operate in a highly competitive environment and may not be able to compete successfully 
the office furniture industry is highly competitive  with a number of competitors offering similar categories of product 
we compete on a variety of factors  including brand recognition and reputation  price  lead time  delivery and service  product design and features  product quality  strength of dealers and other distributors and relationships with customers and key influencers  such as architects  designers and facility managers 
in the north america segment  our top competitors in our primary markets are haworth inc  herman miller  inc  hni corporation  inc  kimball international inc and knoll  inc 
some of our competitors may have lower cost structures and a broader offering of moderately priced products  potentially making it more difficult for us to compete in certain customer segments 
in addition  such competition may prevent us from maintaining or raising the prices of our products in response to rising raw material prices and other inflationary pressures 
although we do not have major offshore competitors in our north america segment  there are other segments of the north america furniture industry  notably the residential furniture and made to stock office furniture segments sold through retailers  where lower cost imports have become dominant 
while customer lead time and customization requirements are currently inhibiting factors  it is possible we could see increased competition from imports in our core markets 
in the international segment  we compete against a larger number of smaller size competitors 
our north american based competitors also compete in some of our international markets  but their market 
table of contents share varies significantly by market 
most of our top competitors have strong relationships with their existing customers that can be a source of significant future sales through repeat and expansion orders 
these competitors manufacture products with strong acceptance in the marketplace and can develop products that could have a competitive advantage over steelcase products 
in certain markets  we compete using an import model which requires longer lead times than local competitors with domestic supply chains 
in the other category  we are experiencing intense price competition in the us contractor whiteboard business sold through a direct bid process  which negatively impacted our operating margins during and as a result  in march  we announced our decision to exit this portion of polyvision s business and that we expect to close one of polyvision s manufacturing facilities before the end of q our continued success depends upon many things  including our ability to continue to manufacture and market high quality  high performance products at competitive prices and our ability to evolve our business model and implement world class processes to enable us to effectively compete in the office furniture industry s increasingly competitive environment 
our success is also dependent on our ability to sustain our positive brand reputation and recognition among existing and potential customers and use our brand and our trademarks effectively as we enter new markets 
our global operations subject us to risks that may negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we have sales offices and manufacturing facilities in many countries  and as a result  we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 
our global operations are subject to risks that may limit our ability to manufacture  design  develop or sell products in particular countries  which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  including differing employment practices and labor issues  local business and cultural factors that differ from our global business standards and practices  regulatory requirements and prohibitions that differ between jurisdictions  restrictions on our operations by governments seeking to support local industries  nationalization of our operations and restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings  and natural disasters  security concerns  including crime  political instability  terrorist activity  armed conflict and civil or military unrest  and global health issues 
in the us and most countries in europe  our revenue and costs are typically in the same currency 
however  there are some situations where we export and import products in different currencies 
we also may hold assets  such as equity investments  real estate investments and cash balances  or incur debt in currencies other than the us dollar 
fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and the currencies of other countries in which we conduct business  and changes in currency controls with respect to such countries  could negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  changes in tariff and import regulations and changes to us and international monetary policies may also negatively impact our revenue 
disruptions within our dealer network could adversely affect our business 
we rely largely on a network of independent and company owned dealers to market  deliver and install our products to customers 
our business is influenced by our ability to initiate and manage new and existing relationships with dealers 
from time to time  an individual dealer or steelcase may choose to terminate the relationship  or the dealership could face financial difficulty leading to failure or difficulty in transitioning to new ownership 
in addition  our competitors could engage in a strategy to attempt to acquire or convert a number of our dealers to carry their products 
we do not believe our business is dependent on any single dealer  the 
table of contents loss of which would have a sustained material adverse effect upon our business 
however  temporary disruption of dealer coverage within a specific local market could temporarily have an adverse impact on our business within the affected market 
the loss or termination of a significant number of dealers could cause difficulties in marketing and distributing our products and have an adverse effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
in the event that a dealer in a strategic market experiences financial difficulty  we may choose to make financial investments in the dealership  reducing the risk of disruption  but increasing our financial exposure 
a portion of our international distribution network is company owned because of the need for us to make financial investments in dealerships in order to preserve our market share and profitability in the affected regions 
in certain cases  we have adopted a direct model of distribution through which we establish company owned sales and service capabilities 
if we are not able to effectively manage these businesses  they could have a negative effect on our operating results 
our direct sale and owned dealer models sell non steelcase products where product gaps exist 
these models involve increased operational risk  the risk of conflict with other distribution channels and the risk that we will not be able to compete effectively to win business in those markets because of a more limited breadth of product offering than a dealer who carries multiple lines of products 
we could be adversely affected by product defects 
product defects can occur within our own product development and manufacturing processes or through our increasing reliance on third parties for product development and manufacturing activities 
we incur various expenses related to product defects  including product warranty costs  product recall and retrofit costs and product liability costs 
the amount of our product defect expenses relative to product sales varies from time to time and could increase in the future 
we maintain a reserve for our product warranty costs based on certain estimates and our knowledge of current events and actions  but our actual warranty costs may exceed our reserve and we could need to increase our accruals for warranty charges 
in addition  the reputation of our brands may be diminished by product defects and recalls 
any significant increase in the rate of our product defect expenses could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
there may be significant limitations to our utilization of net operating losses to offset future taxable income 
we have significant deferred tax asset values related to net operating loss carryforwards nols primarily in various non us jurisdictions 
we may be unable to generate sufficient taxable income from future operations in the applicable jurisdiction or implement tax  business or other planning strategies to fully utilize our nols 
we have nols in various currencies that are also subject to foreign exchange risk  which could reduce the amount we will ultimately realize 
additionally  future changes in tax laws or interpretations of such tax laws may limit our ability to fully utilize our nols

cost of sales  which is reported separately from restructuring costs  decreased basis points from the prior year as a percent of revenue 
the improvement was the result of volume leverage  improved pricing yields  benefits from prior restructuring activities and product simplicity initiatives and continued implementation of lean manufacturing principles  including significant improvement in the performance of our wood product category 
these improvements were partially offset by lower cash surrender value appreciation on company owned life insurance 

table of contents as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have made investments in company owned life insurance policies with the intention of using them as a long term funding source for post retirement medical benefits  deferred compensation and other supplemental retirement benefits

the other category reported operating income of  a decline compared to the prior year 
the decline was primarily the result of higher intangible asset and goodwill impairment related charges at polyvision which offset improved profitability in the premium group and polyvision  excluding the impact of the impairment related charges 
ideo s business grew significantly in  but operating income growth was offset by higher variable compensation earned by certain members of ideo management in connection with an agreement to enable them to acquire an ownership interest in ideo 
over the past few years  polyvision faced intense price competition in the us contractor whiteboard business sold through a direct bid process  and consequently financial performance within this portion of their business continued to lag our expectations 
accordingly  during our annual strategic planning process in q  we evaluated several alternative strategies to address its financial performance 
as a result  we performed impairment testing and recorded a non cash charge of in q  of which related to intangible assets and related to goodwill 
we recorded of similar non cash intangible asset and goodwill impairment related charges at polyvision in in  we entered into an agreement which will allow certain members of the management of ideo to potentially purchase a controlling equity interest in ideo in two phases before the agreement includes a variable compensation program which provides these employees higher variable compensation to acquire ownership  provided certain performance targets are met

revenue increased by in due to growth at ideo and across most of the premium group companies 
gross margin as a percent of revenue was in compared to in the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to improvements at ideo  polyvision and across most of the premium group companies 
restructuring costs included in related to initial costs associated with the announced closure of one of the premium group plants  which we expect to complete by q during q  we announced a restructuring plan at polyvision  linked to a decision to exit a portion of the contractor whiteboard fabrication business which typically carries the lowest gross margins

liquidity and capital resources liquidity we believe we currently need approximately in cash to fund the day to day operating needs of our business 
however  we intend to maintain a minimum of of additional cash and investments as ready liquidity for funding investments in growth initiatives and as a cushion against volatility in the economy 
our cash balances seasonally decline in q due to the timing of variable compensation  retirement plan funding and annual insurance payments 
we plan to use ongoing cash generation to reinvest in the business and to return value to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases 
these are general guidelines and our cash balance may be higher or lower at any point in time

critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition is based upon our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed on the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
although these estimates are based on historical data and management s knowledge of current events and actions it may undertake in the future  actual results may differ from the estimates if different conditions occur 
the accounting estimates that typically involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity are listed and explained below 
these estimates were discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors and affect all segments of the company 
impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and long lived assets goodwill represents the difference between the purchase price and the related underlying tangible and identifiable intangible net asset values resulting from business acquisitions 
annually  or if conditions indicate an earlier review is necessary  the carrying value of the reporting unit is compared to an estimate of its fair value 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  goodwill is impaired and is written down to its estimated fair value 
goodwill is assigned to and the fair value is tested at the reporting unit level 
we evaluated goodwill and intangible assets using ten reportable units where 
table of contents goodwill is recorded specifically north america excluding consolidated dealers  north america consolidated dealers and softcare within the north america reportable segment  international  and brayton  designtex  financial services  ideo  metro  and polyvision within the other category 
annually  we perform an impairment analysis on our goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization using an income approach based on the cash flows attributable to the related products 
we also perform an annual impairment analysis for our intangible assets subject to amortization and our other long lived assets including property  plant and equipment 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
in testing for impairment  we first determine if the asset is recoverable and then compare the discounted cash flows over the asset s remaining life to the carrying value 
at february   we had of goodwill and of net intangible assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as follows other intangible reportable segment goodwill assets  net north america international other category total during q q for polyvision  we performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill in our reporting units 
in the first step to test for potential impairment  we measured the estimated fair value of our reporting units using a combination of two methods based upon a discounted cash flow valuation dcf and a market value approach mva 
the first method used a weighting factor based on dcf while the second valuation was based upon of dcf and of mva 
the mva was only calculated for international and north america excluding consolidated dealers reportable units because these are the only two reportable units where we could obtain comparable market data 
the dcf analysis used the present value of projected cash flows and a residual value and was based on the following assumptions a business is worth today what it can generate in future cash to its owners  cash received today is worth more than an equal amount of cash received in the future and future cash flows can be reasonably estimated 
the mva used a set of four comparable companies to derive a range of market multiples for the last twelve months revenue and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows in measuring fair value 
assumptions used in our impairment valuations  such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital  are consistent with our current internal projections and operating plans  and discount rates we used ranged from to 
however  these assumptions could change over time  which may result in future impairment charges 
as of the valuation date  the enterprise value available for goodwill determined by each method described above is in excess of the underlying reported value of the goodwill as follows enterprise value available in excess reportable segment of goodwill north america international other category 
table of contents within the other category  polyvision s dcf analysis indicated a shortfall in enterprise value available for goodwill 
as the available enterprise value for polyvision was less than reported goodwill and intangible assets  respectively  in the first step of our impairment testing  we were required to perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
as a result of our step two analysis  we recorded a total impairment charge of  of which related to goodwill and related to intangible assets 
at february  polyvision had remaining goodwill and intangible assets of and  respectively 
for each reporting unit other than polyvision  the excess enterprise value available for goodwill is primarily driven by the residual value of future years 
thus  increasing the discount rate by  leaving all other assumptions unchanged  would reduce the enterprise value in excess of goodwill to the following amounts enterprise value available in excess reportable segment of goodwill north america international other category based on the sensitivity analysis above  the north america consolidated dealers and financial services reportable units would have had goodwill balances in excess of enterprise value available for goodwill  and would have triggered the second step of our impairment testing 
these two reporting units had recorded goodwill aggregating as of february  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding goodwill and other intangible assets 
income taxes our annual effective tax rate is based on income  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies available in various jurisdictions in which we operate 
tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating tax positions 
tax positions are reviewed quarterly and balances are adjusted as new information becomes available 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
these assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
future tax benefits of tax losses and credit carryforwards are recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we estimated a tax benefit from the operating loss carryforwards before valuation allowance of  but we recorded a valuation allowance of which reduces our estimated tax benefit to additionally  we estimated a tax benefit from tax credit carryforwards of it is considered more likely than not that a combined benefit of will be realized on these carryforwards 
this determination is based on the expectation that related operations will be sufficiently profitable or various tax  business and other planning strategies will enable us to utilize the carryforwards 
to the extent that available evidence raises doubt about the realization of a deferred income tax asset  a valuation allowance is established 
a decrease in the expected amount of 
table of contents benefit to be realized on the carryforwards would result in a decrease in net income of approximately the net benefit from operating loss and tax credit carryforwards is as follows operating loss carryforwards tax credit february  tax effected carryforwards total carryforwards valuation allowance net benefit pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent on the selection of certain actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include  among others  the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and healthcare costs 
these assumptions are reviewed with our actuaries and updated annually based on relevant external and internal factors and information  including but not limited to  long term expected fund returns  expenses paid from the fund  rates of termination  medical inflation  technology and quality care changes  regulatory requirements  plan changes and governmental coverage changes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
forward looking statements from time to time  in written and oral statements  we discuss our expectations regarding future events and our plans and objectives for future operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed include foreign exchange risk  interest rate risk and fixed income and equity price risk 
foreign exchange risk operating in international markets involves exposure to the possibility of volatile movements in foreign exchange rates 
these exposures may impact future earnings or cash flows 
revenue from foreign locations primarily europe and canada represented approximately of our consolidated revenue in and in we actively manage the foreign currency exposures that are associated with committed foreign currency purchases and sales created in the normal course of 
table of contents business at the local entity level 
exposures that cannot be naturally offset within a local entity to an immaterial amount are often hedged with foreign currency derivatives or netted with offsetting exposures at other entities 
changes in foreign exchange rates that had the largest impact on translating our international operating profit for related to the euro and the canadian dollar versus the us dollar 
we estimate that an additional devaluation of the us dollar against the local currencies would have increased our operating income by approximately in  assuming no changes other than the exchange rate itself 
however  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations 
the sensitivity analysis disregards the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one currency may or may not be offset by losses from another currency 
the translation of the assets and liabilities of our international subsidiaries is made using the foreign exchange rates as of the end of the year 
translation adjustments are not included in determining net income but are disclosed in accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity on the consolidated balance sheets until a sale or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the international subsidiary takes place 
in certain markets  we could recognize a significant gain or loss related to unrealized cumulative translation adjustments if we were to exit the market and liquidate our net investment 
as of february   the cumulative net currency translation adjustments reduced shareholders equity by foreign exchange gains and losses reflect transaction gains and losses 
transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than a business unit s functional currency 
for  net transaction gains were see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily on our cash and cash equivalents  investments  notes receivable and short term borrowings 
substantially all of our interest rates on our long term borrowings were fixed during  thus our interest rate risk was minimized on our debt 
our cash and cash equivalents and investments are primarily invested in short dated instruments 
investments in longer dated securities are entered into to take advantage of temporary market interest differentials  and our intent is to sell all securities in the short term 
however  as of february   we held and par value investments in ars and canadian abcp  respectively  for which no markets currently exist 
the abcp was considered to be in default at february   and no interest was being paid 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we estimate a percentage point change in interest rates would have less than a impact to our results of operations for fixed income and equity price risk we are exposed to fixed income and equity price risk primarily on the cash surrender value associated with our investments in company owned life insurance 
we estimate a adverse change in the value of the underlying funds  which could be caused by changes in interest rates  yield curve  portfolio duration or equity prices  would have reduced our operating income by approximately and in and  respectively 
this quantitative measure has inherent limitations since not all of our investments are in similar asset classes 
in addition  the investment managers actively manage certain fixed income and equity investments and their results could be better or worse than the market returns
