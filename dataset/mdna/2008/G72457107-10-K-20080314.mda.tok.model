at december   primus financial s combined portfolio of credit swaps totaled billion  which includes billion of single name credit swaps  billion of tranches and million of credit swaps on abs 
primus asset management primus asset management  inc  or primus asset management  acts as an investment manager to affiliated companies and third party entities 
it currently manages the credit swap and cash investment portfolios of its affiliate  primus financial 
on july   the offering of primus clo ii  ltd on behalf of third parties was completed 
primus asset management added approximately million to its existing assets under management 
with the completion of this new clo  primus asset management now manages two clo s 
a clo issues securities backed by a diversified pool of primarily below investment grade rated senior secured loans of corporations 
additionally  primus asset management manages three investment grade collateralized swap obligations  or cso s on behalf of third parties 
a cso issues securities backed by one or more credit swaps sold against a diversified pool of investment grade corporate or sovereign reference entities 
pri mus asset management receives fees from third party entities for its investment management services on the five transactions totaling billion of assets under management at december  
table of contents primus asset management has entered into a services agreement with its affiliates  whereby it provides services to its affiliates including management  consulting and information technology 
prs trading harrier in january  prs trading strategies  llc prs trading strategies commenced operations to trade in a broad range of fixed income products  including credit default swaps  investment grade and high yield bonds  as well as leveraged loans 
this was part of primus asset management s strategy to expand its asset management business 
in april  primus guaranty formed harrier credit strategies master fund  lp harrier  a cayman islands exempted limited partnership to enable it to more efficiently raise capital from third party investors 
during the second quarter of  primus guaranty transferred the trading portfolio of its subsidiary  prs trading strategies to harrier 
harrier traded in an expanded range of fixed income products  including credit swaps  total return swaps on loan transactions  cds indices  leveraged loans and investment grade and non investment grade securities 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decided to discontinue harrier  due in part to harrier s performance and difficulty in raising third party capital  given the market environment at that time 
as a result of this decision  in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded restructuring costs of million 
of the total restructuring costs  approximately million was in connection with the write off of certain software and technology assets and approximately million related to net employee termination benefits 
net credit swap revenues losses during  we experienced widening of market credit swap premium levels  which resulted in a decline in the fair value of our credit swap sold 
accordingly  we recorded significant net credit swap losses  which negatively impacted our us gaap results 
we have observed a similar trend of widening market credit swap premium levels into changes in the fair value of our credit swap portfolio are a function of the notional amount and composition of the portfolio and prevailing market credit swap premiums for comparable credit swaps 
in our experience  considerable fluctuations may occur in the fair values of credit swaps from period to period and  as a result  the reader of our financial statements should not infer future results from historical net credit swap revenues or losses 
net credit swap revenue in our consolidated statements of operations  comprises the premiums earned and expensed on credit swaps  gains or losses realized as a result of the termination of credit swaps and changes in the fair value of our credit swaps 
net credit swap revenue was earned by both primus financial and harrier 
although both companies earned net credit swap revenue  the strategies of the two companies were different 
primus financial generally sells credit swaps in order to earn premium income over the tenor of the contract  generally five years  whereas harrier engaged in the active buying and selling of credit swaps and generally would only hold positions for a limited portion of the swap s full tenor 
we receive premium income from the credit swaps we sell 
in general  premiums are received quarterly in arrears and are accrued daily into income 
in accordance with gaap  we carry our credit swaps on our consolidated statements of financial condition at their fair value 
changes in the fair value of our credit swap portfolio are included as a component of net credit swap revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
if a credit swap has an increase or decline in fair value during a period  the increase will add to our net credit swap revenue and the decline will subtract from our net credit swap revenue for that period 
primus financial and harrier each enters into valid isda master agreement with their counterparties and each entity aggregates their respective transactions on a counterparty basis for presentation on the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
if the aggregate total of fair values for a counterparty is a net gain  the total is recorded as a component of unrealized gains on credit swaps  at fair value  in our consolidated statements of financial condition 
if the aggregate total of fair values for a counterparty is a net loss  the total is recorded as a component of unrealized losses on credit swaps  at fair value  in our consolidated statements of financial condition 

table of contents as a general rule  when primus financial sells credit swaps  it is our intention to maintain the transaction until maturity 
however  there are two sets of circumstances in which we could elect to terminate transactions prior to maturity  and we monitor our portfolio on a continuing basis to assess whether those circumstances are present 
terminations of credit swaps prior to maturity may generate realized gains or losses 
first  whenever we receive new information suggesting that the credit quality of the underlying risk has deteriorated to a material degree  we consider the possibility of terminating the transaction  usually at a loss  to avoid a larger loss that could result if the credit swap were to remain in place until a defined credit event occurs 
the principal factor that governs our decision regarding termination in these circumstances is whether we believe that the underlying risk has become substantially greater than the level of risk we would choose to assume in entering into a new sale of credit swaps 
since inception  we have terminated due to credit considerations less than of the notional amount of credit swaps sold 
second  we may elect to terminate a transaction for reasons other than credit considerations 
terminations of this type may generate realized gains or losses 
in making a decision to terminate a transaction for reasons other than credit considerations  we consider a number of different factors  including our view as to whether the capital dedicated to the position could be profitably reallocated to other opportunities over a short time horizon  the total size of our portfolio in relation to our capital and the total size of our swap positions and exposures with a particular counterparty 
we refer to terminations effected under these circumstances as resizing or rebalancing 
since inception  we have terminated less than of the notional amount of credit swaps sold  based on resizing or rebalancing considerations 
we may terminate a credit swap in one of two ways 
we may negotiate an agreed termination through the original counterparty an unwind 
we may negotiate an assignment and novation of our rights and obligations under the credit swap to a third party an assignment 
in the event of an unwind or assignment  we pay or receive a cash settlement negotiated with the counterparty or assignee  based on the fair value of the credit swap contract and the accrued premium on the swap contract at the time of negotiation 
the amounts we pay or receive are recorded as a realization of fair value and as a realization of accrued premiums in the period in which the termination occurs 
interest income the company earned interest income on its cash and cash equivalents  available for sale investments  which include us government agency obligations  the company s investment in clo s and trading account assets  which included corporate and sovereign bonds 
other trading revenue loss other trading revenue loss is comprised of the net trading gains or losses from harrier prs trading 
other trading revenue loss includes the realized and unrealized gains or losses on total return swaps on loan transactions  corporate and sovereign bonds and the net interest earned on the total return swaps and from the loans in the warehousing period

income taxes primus guaranty  prs trading strategies  primus bermuda  primus financial and harrier are not expected to be engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business in the united states and as a result are not expected to be subject to united states federal  state or local income tax 
primus asset management is a united states domiciled corporation and is subject to united states federal  state and local income tax on its income  including on fees received from primus financial 
primus re may be subject to united states federal  state or local income tax  or primus asset management may be required to include all or part of primus re s income in calculating its liability for united states federal  state or local income tax  depending on the manner in which primus re conducts its business and the tax elections it makes

table of contents engaged in a united states business in new york city and subject to income tax  is approximately not including united states branch profits tax that would be imposed on primus bermuda were primus financial deemed to be making distributions to primus bermuda 
primus guaranty and certain of its subsidiaries are currently undergoing federal tax audits  but no audit has yet been completed 
for united states federal income tax purposes  primus guaranty and primus bermuda are likely to be treated as passive foreign investment companies  or pfics 
critical accounting policies valuation of credit swaps from the inception of our business  we have applied statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas   accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which established accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
sfas requires recognition of all credit swaps on the consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value 
the fair value of the credit swaps depends on a number of factors  primarily the market level of credit swap premiums associated with individual reference entities 
credit swaps are valued using market standard pricing models which calculate the net present value of differences between future premiums on currently quoted market credit swaps and the contractual future credit swap premiums on contracts we have undertaken 
our pricing model has been internally developed but is benchmarked against a market standard model 
generally  our model uses quoted market credit swap premium data that we purchase from independent pricing services 
this service takes pricing information from a number of prominent dealers and brokers in the credit swap market across a range of standard maturities and restructuring terms  and creates average mid market credit swap premium quotes on specific reference entities 
we adjust the mid market pricing we receive from the pricing service t o reflect an estimate of the cost to close the position 
we believe there are a variety of factors that may influence market credit swap premium levels 
the principal factor is the market s view of the probability that a reference entity will default over the multi year horizon typical for a credit swap contract 
those views in turn are influenced by the state of the economy  the outlook for corporate financial health in general as well as the outlook for particular industries and companies 
additional factors include the magnitude of debt outstanding and debt paying capacity within those same industries and companies 
one factor specific to the credit swap market is the capacity of credit swap market participants to sell credit swaps 
if  for example  commercial banks are actively buying protection to manage their regulatory capital  this will tend  other factors being equal  to absorb the capacity of protection sellers and cause an increase in market credit swap premiums 
conversely  creation of special purpos e vehicles that sell protection create additional protection seller capacity and  absent additional demand  can cause a decrease in market premiums 
absent rapid and steep changes  interest rates have  at most  a limited effect on market credit swap premium levels 
share based employee compensation plans effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee options and other forms of equity compensation based on estimated fair values 
compensation expense is recognized based on the fair value of options  performance shares  restricted shares and restricted share units rsu as determined on the date of grant and is being expensed over the related vesting period 
the fair value of the options granted is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company continues to apply the black scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for share awards as it deems it to be the most appropriate model 
the use of the black scholes model requires certain estimates for values of variables used in the model 

table of contents subsequent event on january   standard and poor s rating services s p announced a change in their ratings methodology and assumptions relating to cdos and other structured products  including certain asset backed securities abs 
as a result of these changes  the s p ratings on six residential mortgage backed securities referenced by credit default swaps written by primus financial were downgraded to ccc or below 
at december   the notional principal amount and the fair values of these six credit swaps were million and million  respectively 
at december   the notional principal amount and the fair values on credit swaps sold on abs  not downgraded to ccc or below was million and million  respectively 
under the terms of our agreements governing the credit swaps on abs  a downgrade of the underlying abs securities to ccc or below is considered a defined credit event 
upon the occurrence of a defined credit event  a counterparty to the credit swap has the right to present the underlying abs  in whole or in part  to primus financial in exchange for the cash notional value of the credit swap corresponding to the face amount of the securities presented physical settlement 
if  following a defined credit event  no physical settlement occurs  a counterparty may make a loss claim in the event of a principal write down event  if any pay as you go 
a principal write down event occurs when the abs servicer determines that there is insufficient collateral to pay a portion or all of the face value of the underlying securities 
any principal write down claims will be paid by primus financial up to the notional amount of the credit default sw ap 
to date  of the six abs credit swaps which suffered a downgrade  one counterparty has physically settled by delivering to primus financial an abs with million face amount and primus financial paid million to the counterparty 
that swap is terminated as a result of the physical settlement and primus financial will no longer receive premiums from the counterparty 
as the owner of the abs  primus financial is entitled to receive payments of principal and interest thereon 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview during the second half of  the global credit markets experienced difficult market conditions 
these conditions resulted in sharp widening of credit spreads  greater volatility  lower levels of liquidity  significant re pricing of credit risk and downgrades by rating agencies 
the credit spread widening presented opportunities for a significant increase in our transaction volume in our credit protection business 
during  primus financial grew its credit swap portfolio by billion to billion from billion 
this was the highest new transaction volume in any year of the company s history 
the significant widening in credit spreads had a negative impact on our us gaap results for the year ended december   primarily resulting from significant unrealized losses from the mark to market losses of our credit swap portfolio 
our net income loss for was million compared with million for the net loss during was primarily due to unrealized losses from the mark to market of our credit swap portfolio  compared with unrealized gains from the mark to market of our credit swap portfolio during this was the result of wider credit spreads during as compared to net credit swap premiums earned were million in  compared with million in the increase in net premiums is attributable to the significant growth in primus financial s portfolio of credit swaps sold in interest income on our portfolio of investments was million in  compared with million in the increase is due to higher market interest rates  together with increased invested balances  mainly arising from the investment of the proceeds of the million  senior notes offering by primus guaranty in december other trading revenue loss incurred by harrier prs trading was million during compared with million during the losses during primarily reflect the difficult market conditions resulting in mark downs in the value of loans and bond positions 

table of contents interest expense and distributions on preferred securities were million in  compared with million in the increase is due to higher short term market interest rates during the second half of  together with higher debt balances associated with the million  senior notes offering by primus guaranty in december during the second half of  the turbulent market conditions also affected the debt capital markets 
beginning in august  there was limited investor demand for our preferred securities and our subordinated deferrable notes issued in the auction rate market 
as a result of the insufficient demand  the auctions did not clear and the rates on these preferred securities and deferrable notes were set at the maximum spread rates  as specified in the respective security agreements 
these maximum rates are subject to increase if the credit ratings on these securities are downgraded 
this result ed in additional interest expense and distributions of million during the second half of if these securities continue to be set at the maximum spread rates  we anticipate incremental interest and distributions costs of approximately million on an annual basis 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decided to discontinue harrier  a fund formed by the company in april  due in part to harrier s performance and the difficulty in raising third party capital  given the market environment at that time 
see restructuring costs below for further discussion 
our operating expenses  excluding restructuring costs  were million in  compared with million in the increase was primarily due to the expansion of our business activities 
consolidated net credit swap revenue loss consolidated net credit swap revenue loss was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

net unrealized gains losses on credit swaps were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the change in unrealized gains losses on credit swaps reflects the change in the fair value of our credit swap portfolio during these periods 
as previously discussed  during the second half of  significantly wider credit spreads as a result of re pricing of credit risk led to the unrealized losses on our credit swap portfolio 
the unrealized gain in on credit swaps sold was primarily attributable to the increase in the fair value of the portfolio as market premiums fell during that year 
asset management and advisory fees we earned million and million of asset management and advisory fees for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to asset management fees related to the offering of primus clo i  ltd 
on december  and july   the offerings of primus clo i  ltd 
and primus clo ii  ltd  respectively  on behalf of third parties were completed 
primus asset management acts as collateral manager for both 
under the terms of the collateral management agreements  primus asset management receives management fees quarterly for managing the selection  acquisition and disposition of the underlying collateral and for monitoring the underlying collateral  subject to the terms of the agreement 

table of contents in addition  primus asset management manages three investment grade collateralized swap obligations  or cso s  on behalf of third parties 
some of our cso asset management contracts also provide for the receipt of contingent performance fees at the maturity of the contracts  none of which has been earned or accrued at december  or  respectively 
interest income we earned interest income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in interest income is attributable to higher average invested balances resulting from the december senior notes offering of million by primus guaranty and retained cash earnings  and higher yields on our investment portfolio 
the increase in yields is attributable to generally higher short term market rates of interest during and average yields on our cash  cash equivalents and investments were in the years ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the table below summarizes our interest income for the years ended december  and and our total cash  cash equivalents  available for sale and trading account securities at december  and in thousands

compensation expense for the year ended december  increased approximately million over the comparable prior period 
the increase was primarily the result of result of higher headcount as we expanded our business activities  partially offset by lower performance based incentives 
share compensation expense was approximately million for each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
professional and legal fees expense includes audit and tax advisor fees  legal costs  recruitment fees and director and officer insurance expense 
professional and legal fees were consistent for the years ended december  compared with the corresponding prior period 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily as a result of certain capitalized software development costs being fully amortized  partially offset by increases in depreciation expense on new fixed asset purchases and capitalized software costs 
the increase in technology and data expense was primarily attributable to the expansion of our technology platform to accommodate new trading strategies associated with our asset management build out 
other operating expenses include rent  bank fees  rating agency fees  brokerage expense  travel and entertainment  exchange fees and other administrative expenses 
the increase in other expenses was primarily due to higher bank  debt and investment management fees associated with our asset management business 
restructuring costs during the fourth quarter of  the company decided to discontinue harrier  a fund formed by the company in april  due in part to harrier s performance and difficulty in raising third party capital  given the market environment at that time 
in the fourth quarter  restructuring costs of million were charged in connection with harrier s discontinuation 
of the total restructuring costs  approximately million was in connection with the write off of certain software and technology assets and approximately million related to net employee termination benefits 
interest expense and preferred distributions during the second half of  the turbulent market conditions also affected the debt capital markets 
beginning in august  investor demand was limited for our preferred securities and certain of our subordinated deferrable notes issued in the auction rate market  during the standard day auction rate resets 
as a result of the insufficient demand  the auctions did not clear and the rates on these preferred securities and deferrable notes were set at the maximum spread rates at current rating levels  as specified in the respective security agreements  resulted in additional interest expense of million 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million of interest expense  respectively 
the increase in interest expense was primarily the result of higher debt 
table of contents balances as a result of the million  senior notes offering by primus guaranty in december  higher short term interest rates and the maximum spread rates noted above 
in february  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution that effectively converted a notional amount of million of the company s million  senior notes due in december  to floating rate debt based on the three month libor rate plus a spread as defined in the agreement 
primus financial also made net distributions of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  on the primus financial cumulative preferred securities issued in december the increase in net distributions was primarily due to increased short term interest rates and the maximum spread rates noted above 
income taxes provision for income taxes was thousand and thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively 
primus guaranty had a net deferred tax asset  fully offset by a valuation allowance  of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the change in the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance resulted primarily from primus asset management s share compensation expense  capitalized costs and pre operating formation costs 
it is expected that only the income of primus asset management and its subsidiary  primus re  are likely to be subject to united states federal and local income taxes 
however  were primus bermuda to be subject to income tax  at a combined united states federal  new york state and new york city income tax rate of  on its united states gaap income or loss  then its income tax expense or benefit  excluding interest and penalties  would have been approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these figures assume that primus financial is not deemed to be making distributions to primus bermuda  such distributions would subject primus bermuda to an additional united states federal branch profits tax 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  overview our net income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in net income during was primarily due to the mark to market unrealized gains on credit swaps from the portfolio of credit swaps sold by primus financial  compared with unrealized losses in the portfolio in interest income on our portfolio of investments was million in  compared with million in the increase is due to higher market interest rates  together with increased invested balances  mainly arising from the investment of the proceeds of the million debt issuance by primus financial in december interest expense and distributions on preferred shares issued by primus financial were million in  compared with million in the increase is due to higher market interest rates in  together with the interest expense associated with the million debt issuance by primus financial in december our operating expenses were million in  compared with million in the increase was primarily due to higher compensation and employee benefits as a result of increased headcount and higher professional fees  including employee recruiting costs

compensation expense for the year ended december  increased million over the comparable prior year 
overall  the increase was primarily the result of an increase in headcount as we expanded our business operations and higher performance based incentives 
included in the year 
table of contents ended december   was a credit of approximately thousand related to a reduction in share compensation expense as a result of employee departures 
compensation expense for the year ended december  included approximately thousand related to the accelerated compensation expenses and accelerated vesting of shares related to the departure of former employees 
our accrued cash incentive compensation expense was million for the year ended december   compared with an accrued expense of million in the corresponding year of share compensation expense was approximately million for both years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in professional fees is primarily related to increased provisions for legal fees and employee recruiting costs 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is due to the increase in purchases of fixed assets and higher capitalized software costs 
the increase in technology and data expense was primarily attributable to the expansion of our technology platform to accommodate new trading strategies associated with our asset management build out 
the increase in other expenses was primarily due to travel related costs and occupancy expenses associated with the additional office space in new york and london 
interest expense and preferred distributions for the years ended december  and  we incurred million and million of interest expense  respectively 
the interest expense was incurred on the million year subordinated debt and the million year subordinated deferrable interest notes that were issued by primus financial in july and december  respectively 
the interest rate for the year subordinated debt averaged and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on december   primus guaranty  ltd 
completed an offering of million  senior notes  which mature in december interest on the senior notes will be payable quarterly of each year  beginning on march  on december   primus financial issued million of subordinated deferrable interest notes  which mature in june the average interest rate on these notes was during the year ended december  primus financial also made net distributions of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  on the primus financial cumulative preferred shares issued in december the average rate on these securities was and during the years ended december  and  respectively 
income taxes provision for income taxes was thousand and thousand for the years ended december  and  respectively 
primus guaranty had a net deferred tax asset  fully offset by a valuation allowance  of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the change in the deferred tax asset and valuation allowance resulted primarily from primus asset management s estimated net operating loss 
it is expected that only the income of primus asset management and its subsidiary  primus re  are likely to be subject to united states federal and local income taxes 
however  were primus bermuda to be subject to income tax  at a combined united states federal  new york state and new york city income tax rate of  on its united states gaap income  then its income tax expense excluding interest and penalties would have been approximately million and approximately million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these figures assume that primus financial is not deemed to be making distributions to primus bermuda  such distributions would subject primus bermuda to an additional united states federal branch profits tax 
non gaap financial measures economic results in addition to the results of operations presented in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  our management and our board of directors use certain non gaap 
table of contents financial measures called economic results 
we believe that our economic results provide information useful to investors in understanding our underlying operational performance and business trends 
economic results is an accrual based measure of our financial performance  which in our view  better reflects our long term buy and hold strategy in our credit protection business 
however  economic results is not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under gaap  therefore  these non gaap financial measures should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for gaap 
we define economic results as gaap net income loss adjusted for the following

provision for credit events 
we exclude unrealized gains losses on credit swaps sold because the fair value will fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in market credit swap premium levels and are not necessarily indicative of the performance of our underlying business and our general strategy of holding credit swaps sold until maturity  at which time the mark to market values would revert to zero  to the extent no realized gains or losses had occurred 
we exclude realized gains on credit swaps sold because our strategy is focused on generation of premium income as opposed to trading gains and losses  although we amortize these realized gains over the original remaining life of the terminated contracts 
the following table below presents a reconciliation of our economic results non gaap measures to gaap

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for gains or losses that may result from changes in the value of a financial instrument as a consequence of changes in market conditions 
our primary market risk is changes in market credit swap premium levels  which increase or decrease the fair value of our credit swap portfolio 
market credit swap premium levels change as a result of specific events or news related to a reference entity  such as a change in a credit rating by any of the rating agencies 
additionally  market credit swap premium levels can vary as a result of changes in market sentiment 
as a general matter  given our strategy of holding credit swaps sold until maturity  we do not seek to manage our overall exposure to market credit swap premium levels  and we expect fluctuations in the fair value of our credit swap portfolio as a result of these changes 
as of december   each one basis point increase or decrease in market credit swap premi ums would decrease or increase the fair value of our credit swap portfolio by approximately million 

table of contents we face other market risks  which are likely to have a lesser impact upon our net income than those associated with market credit swap premium level risk 
these other risks include interest rate risk associated with market interest rate movements 
these movements may affect the value of our credit swap portfolio as our pricing model includes an interest rate component  which is used to discount future expected cash flows 
interest rate movements may also affect the carrying value of and yield on our investments 
the primus financial cumulative preferred shares pays distributions that are based upon the auction rate preferred market 
a difference between the rates we pay in the auction rate preferred market and the interest rates we receive on our investments may result in an additional cost to our company 
assuming that auction results with respect to the primus financial cumulative preferred shares reflect prevailing short term interest rates  each basis poi nt increase or decrease in the level of those rates would increase or decrease primus financial s annual distribution cost by approximately  for each of the series a and series b mmp receipts 
in addition  interest rate movements may increase or decrease the interest expense we incur on our million of subordinated deferrable interest notes 
a basis point increase in the level of those rates would increase primus financial s interest expense by  annually 
in february  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major financial institution that effectively converted a notional amount of million of the company s million  senior notes due in december  to floating rate debt based on the three month libor rate plus a spread as defined in the agreement 
assuming a basis point increase or decrease in the three month libor rate  our interest expense would increase or decrease by  annually 
counterparty risk represents the potential for loss should one or more of our counterparties be unable to meet its obligations due to bankruptcy or a similar event  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our counterparties generally have investment grade credit ratings
