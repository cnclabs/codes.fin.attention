quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk liquidity and capital resources cash increased significantly in the year increasing to thousand dollars from approximately thousand dollars  an increase of approximately thousand dollars 
the increase in cash is a result of increased cash flow from operations  managements decisions to invest prudently in capital expenditures and improved cash management 
the amount of short term borrowings outstanding at december  was million dollars 
this is a reduction of thousand dollars from the december   balance of million dollars 
during the year ended december  the company focused on programs to more effectively manage working capital 
accounts receivable at december  and aggregated approximately million dollars respectively 
in  net sales increased thousand dollars or  without a comparative increase in accounts receivable 
in addition  inventory levels increased  from approximately million dollars to million dollars  comparing december  and  an increase of approximately thousand or 
the increase was mainly attributable to the timing of year purchases of materials  against a january st price increases from our vendors on key raw materials 
accounts payable at december  increased to approximately million dollars from thousand dollars 
the increase is reflective of year end vendor invoices for purchases of raw materials 
as a result of the above in  the company continued to improve its current ratio  to to at december   from to at december  at december  the company was in compliance with its debt covenants 
the primary sources of our liquidity are our operations and short term borrowings from regions bank pursuant to a revolving line of credit aggregating million 
such line matures may   bears interest at the day libor plus basis points approximately at december  and is secured by our trade receivables  inventory and intangible assets 
we are required to maintain a minimum working capital of million and meet certain other financial covenants during the term of the agreement 
as of december   we were obligated under this arrangement in the amount of  the company plans on renewing the line of credit upon maturity to be used to finance our working capital as needed 
in connection with the purchase and expansion of the alabama facility  we closed on industrial development bonds during the proceeds were utilized for both the repayment of certain advances used to purchase the alabama facility and to expand such facility for our future needs 
during july  we completed a second industrial development bond financing aggregating million through the city of montgomery  alabama 
such transaction funded an approximate  square foot addition to the manufacturing facility as well as the remaining machinery and equipment additions required therein 
this project was substantially completed during in order to market the industrial development bonds at favorable rates  we obtained a substitute irrevocable letter of credit for the issue and a new irrevocable letter of credit for the issue 
under such letters of credit agreements maturing on july   we are required to maintain a stipulated level of working capital  a designated maximum debt to tangible ratio  and a required debt service coverage ratio 
such letters of credit are secured by a first priority mortgage on the underlying alabama facility and equipment 
the bonds are marketed weekly at the prevailing rates for such tax exempt instruments 
during the year ended december  such bonds carried interest ranging between and annually 
interest and principal are payable quarterly 
we believe current operations are sufficient to meet these obligations 
the bonds maturity date is april  on april  we entered into a financing obligation with regions bank whereby they advanced us  to finance equipment acquisitions at our kinpak facility 
such obligation is due in monthly installments of principal aggregating approximately  plus interest at prevailing rates 
the outstanding balance and interest rate on this obligation at december  was  and interest rate is libor plus per annum or

net income and related earnings per share for the year ended december  was not materially impacted by this event

during the past few years  we have introduced various new products to our customers 
at times this has required us to carry greater amounts of overall inventory and has resulted in lower inventory turnover rates 
the effects of such inventory turnover have not been material to our overall operations 
we believe that all required capital to maintain such increases can continue to be provided by operations and current financing arrangements 
many of the raw materials that we use in the manufacturing process are commodities that are subject to fluctuating prices 
we react to long term increases by passing along all or a portion of such increases to our customers as it is deemed appropriate 
as of december  and through the date hereof  we did not and do not have any material commitments for capital expenditures  nor do we have any other present commitment that is likely to result in our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
in addition  except for our need for additional capital to finance inventory purchases  we know of no trend  additional demand  event or uncertainty that will result in  or that is reasonably likely to result in  our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
the cost of petroleum and related products  major components in many of our products  which were already in an increasing cost spiral  became even more unstable in the practical dynamics of our business do not afford us the same pricing flexibility with our customers  available to our suppliers 
we cannot as immediately as our suppliers pass along the price increases to our national retailers and distributors
