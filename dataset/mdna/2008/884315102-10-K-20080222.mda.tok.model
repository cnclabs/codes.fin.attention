item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview introduction thomas betts corporation is a leading designer and manufacturer of electrical components used in industrial  commercial  communications and utility markets 
we are also a leading producer of highly engineered steel structures  used primarily for utility transmission  and commercial heating units 
we have operations in approximately countries 
manufacturing  marketing and sales activities are concentrated primarily in north america and europe 
we have benefited from generally favorable conditions in our key end markets over the last several years 
favorable market conditions and focused business strategies have helped us realize solid sales  earnings and cash flow growth 
our businesses are volume sensitive  and given the competitive nature of our markets  it is essential that we offer a strong value proposition to our customers and continually improve our unit costs and operating efficiencies 
in addition to favorable market conditions  our sales growth has benefited from our broad portfolio of quality brands and products  excellent customer service  integrated information systems  and by being fast and flexible in meeting customer needs 
we have successfully managed volatile and rising prices in key commodity markets and driven earnings growth through higher sales  improved operating efficiencies and disciplined cost control 
thomas betts had an outstanding year in  driven by strong performance in all of our businesses  with each segment reporting double digit earnings as a percentage of sales 
consolidated net sales in grew compared to with of this growth coming from acquisitions 
the sales improvement in our base business was driven by strong demand in our key markets and to a lesser extent the impact of price increases that offset higher material and energy costs and foreign currency 
earnings from operations grew over reflecting the impact of higher sales volumes  the corporation s continued ability to offset higher material and energy costs 
we completed four strategic acquisitions lamson sessions co  joslyn hi voltage  power solutions and drilling technical supply sa in for a total investment of about million 
the acquisitions should account for approximately growth in the corporation s consolidated sales in our ability to successfully integrate and operate these acquisitions provides a significant opportunity to grow and enhance the company 
management has decided to sell the pvc and hdpe pipe operations acquired as part of the lamson sessions co 
acquisition  which has annual sales of about million 
at december   the pvc and hdpe pipe operations had a net book value of million 
the corporation has retained a financial advisor to assist with the sale of these operations 
as a result of the decision to sell the pvc and hdpe pipe operations  operating results for the pipe business are reported as discontinued operations and are shown on a net basis on the corporations consolidated financial statements and excluded from segment results 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements contained in this report requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain amounts reported as net sales  costs  expenses  assets or liabilities and certain amounts disclosed as contingent assets or liabilities 
actual results may differ from those estimates or assumptions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of page of 
table of contents the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe our critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition the corporation recognizes revenue when products are shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss  collection of the relevant receivable is probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
the corporation also recognizes revenue for service agreements associated with its power solutions business over the applicable service periods 
sales discounts  quantity and price rebates  and allowances are estimated based on contractual commitments and experience and recorded in the period as a reduction of revenue in which the sale is recognized 
quantity rebates are in the form of volume incentive discount plans  which include specific sales volume targets or year over year sales volume growth targets for specific customers 
certain distributors can take advantage of price rebates by subsequently reselling the corporation s products into targeted construction projects or markets 
following a distributor s sale of an eligible product  the distributor submits a claim for a price rebate 
the corporation provides additional allowances for bad debts when circumstances dictate 
a number of distributors  primarily in the electrical segment  have the right to return goods under certain circumstances and those returns  which are reasonably estimable  are accrued as a reduction of revenue at the time of shipment 
management analyzes historical returns and allowances  current economic trends and specific customer circumstances when evaluating the adequacy of accounts receivable related reserves and accruals 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market  the corporation periodically evaluates the carrying value of its inventories 
the corporation also periodically performs an evaluation of inventory for excess and obsolete items 
such evaluations are based on management s judgment and use of estimates 
such estimates incorporate inventory quantities on hand  aging of the inventory  sales forecasts for particular product groupings  planned dispositions of product lines and overall industry trends 
goodwill and other intangible assets we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires a transitional and annual test of goodwill and indefinite lived assets associated with reporting units for indications of impairment 
the corporation performs its annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year  unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments 
indications of impairment require significant judgment by management 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 each test of goodwill requires that we determine the fair value of each reporting unit  and compare the fair value to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of three valuation methods market multiple approach  discounted cash flow approach  and comparable transactions approach 
the market multiple approach provides indications of value based on market multiples for public companies involved in similar lines of business 
the discounted cash flow approach calculates the present value of projected future cash flows using appropriate discount rates 
the comparable transactions approach provides indications of value based on an examination of recent transactions in which companies in similar lines of business were acquired 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the corporation must perform a second more detailed impairment assessment 
the second impairment assessment involves allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities in page of 
table of contents order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill as of the assessment date 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date 
long lived assets we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization 
for purposes of recognizing and measuring impairment of long lived assets  the corporation evaluates assets at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows for associated product groups 
the corporation reviews long lived assets to be held and used for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
indications of impairment require significant judgment by management 
if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset in the associated product groups is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are considered to be impaired 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
when fair values are not available  we estimate fair values using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
pension and other postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  sfas no 
revised  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
for purposes of calculating pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related costs  the corporation uses certain actuarial assumptions 
two critical assumptions  the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets  are important elements of expense and or liability measurement 
we evaluate these assumptions annually 
other assumptions include employee demographic factors retirement patterns  mortality and turnover  rate of compensation increase and the healthcare cost trend rate 
see additional information contained in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations qualified pension plans 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method recognizes the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and provides a valuation allowance based on a more likely than not criteria 
the corporation has valuation allowances for deferred tax assets primarily associated with foreign net operating loss carryforwards and foreign income tax credit carryforwards 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the corporation s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
management believes that it is more likely than not that future taxable income  based on enacted tax law in effect as of december   will be sufficient to realize the recorded deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowances 
environmental costs environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate 
remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that those costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated based on evaluations of current available facts related to page of 
table of contents each site 
the operation of manufacturing plants involves a high level of susceptibility in these areas  and there is no assurance that we will not incur material environmental or occupational health and safety liabilities in the future 
moreover  expectations of remediation expenses could be affected by  and potentially significant expenditures could be required to comply with  environmental regulations and health and safety laws that may be adopted or imposed in the future 
future remediation technology advances could adversely impact expectations of remediation expenses 
outlook looking at  we expect continued growth in non residential construction and industrial mro maintenance  repair and operations markets  although at a slower rate than in we believe that in total our markets will continue to grow in we expect sales growth of approximately for when compared with acquisitions completed in and january are expected to contribute approximately to the sales growth  with the balance of the sales growth coming from existing businesses 
we expect diluted per share earnings from continuing operations in the range of to for the full year the companies acquired in and january should have a dramatic impact on earnings in with contributions from the acquisitions providing of the growth in earnings from operations before considering the associated interest expense 
existing businesses and corporate activities should provide the additional of the growth in earnings from operations 
full year earnings guidance assumptions include depreciation and capital spending of million each  acquisition related amortization of million  interest expense of million  an effective tax rate of approximately and million fully diluted average shares outstanding 
the key risk factors we may face in include realizing the benefits of integrating recently acquired companies  the potential negative impact of market uncertainty and tightening credit markets  and volatility in commodity markets 
thomas betts has a relatively modest direct exposure to residential construction 
nevertheless  deteriorating conditions in that market could potentially have an impact on certain of our products sold into the light commercial construction and utility distribution markets
