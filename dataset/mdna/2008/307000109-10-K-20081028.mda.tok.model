item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal and our expectations for fiscal you should read this discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes to consolidated financial statements which are included in this report 
our discussion contains forward looking statements which are based upon our current expectations and which involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth in the cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements in the general information section of this report and the risk factors listed in part i  item a of this report 
our fiscal year generally ends on the saturday closest to august of each year  which generally results in an extra week every six years 
fiscal was a week year  compared with a week year in fiscal the second quarter of fiscal included weeks compared with weeks in the second quarter of fiscal fiscal overview fiscal was a challenging year for our customers  as higher energy prices and inflation outpaced wage growth  unemployment rates increased  and consumer confidence fell dramatically 
in addition  turmoil in the financial markets led to significant uncertainty throughout the economy 
as a result  our customers increased their purchases of lower margin consumable merchandise and constrained purchases of higher margin discretionary merchandise  which pressured sales and cost of sales 
despite the challenging economic environment  we were able to produce solid results during fiscal due to our ability to adapt quickly to the changing environment 
we adjusted our merchandise assortment to focus on consumable categories  lowered inventory levels related to discretionary merchandise to manage inventory risk  and worked aggressively to reduce our expenses 
we also received some benefit to sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result of the government stimulus program and additional advertising 
as a result of these efforts  our performance in the second half of fiscal was stronger than our performance in the first half of fiscal during fiscal  as compared with fiscal  our net sales increased to billion  our net income decreased to million  and our diluted net income per common share increased to 
the results for fiscal as compared with fiscal were negatively impacted by the loss of one week during the reporting period  as discussed above 
sales in comparable stores stores open more than months for fiscal  which were reported for the week period ending august   compared with the week period ending september   increased 
we believe that the difficult economic environment faced by our customers  including higher energy prices and inflationary pressures  contributed to the low single digit comparable stores sales growth 
the various components affecting our results for fiscal are discussed in more detail below 
during fiscal  we continued to invest in our strategic initiatives designed to increase revenues and improve financial returns as discussed below as part of our food strategy  we installed refrigerated coolers in approximately stores 
as of august   approximately  stores had coolers for the sale of refrigerated food 
in addition  we expanded the selling space for food in approximately  additional stores  and approximately  stores now accept food stamps 
we continued to develop our global sourcing group  which helped to strengthen the quality and value of merchandise within our treasure hunt strategy and lower our costs 
as part of our concept renewal effort  we continued to incorporate improvements in store layout and design into new stores  and we renovated several markets to better understand the sustainability of performance improvements resulting from new layout and design elements 
we opened stores and closed stores as we continued to focus on improving new store performance 
as part of our store of the future project  we introduced new technology in approximately  stores  bringing the total number of stores with the store of the future platform to approximately  stores as of august  in connection with our project accelerate initiative  we began utilizing a new merchandise financial planning tool to support key merchandising decisions  and we implemented new category management processes 
in addition  we created a structured framework for pricing decisions that enabled us to better balance the need for profitability with the customer s perception of value 
fiscal outlook during fiscal  we plan to focus on driving revenues  mitigating risk and managing costs through the following key initiatives in conjunction with our food strategy  we plan to continue the expansion of our assortment of traffic driving consumables  providing customers with more of what they need in a challenging economic environment 
to strengthen the family dollar brand with customers and to reinforce the values we offer  we plan to increase our marketing and promotional events 
we plan to continue the roll out of our store of the future initiative  upgrading the technology platform in approximately  additional stores 
we expect that roughly half of our stores will be able to accept credit cards during the fiscal holiday season 
to improve the customer s shopping experience  we plan to renovate approximately stores  leveraging key concept renewal principles 
we will begin the implementation of new assortment planning processes and space management tools as part of the continuation of our project accelerate initiative 
through our price optimization work  the expansion of our private label offering and global sourcing efforts  we plan to continue to mitigate pricing pressure from rising commodity and raw material costs 
reflecting the uncertainty that exists in the current economic environment  we will continue our measured pace of new store openings so that we can focus on improving our returns on existing assets 
we expect to open approximately stores and close approximately stores 
for fiscal  we expect comparable store sales to increase to from the comparable week period in fiscal we expect to see continued pressure on cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  as our customers continue to focus on lower margin consumable merchandise and as diesel costs remain volatile 
we believe that benefits from lower markdowns  global sourcing and improved inventory shrinkage could offset much of this pressure 
while we will maintain a strong focus on controlling our cost structure  we expect selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  to be primarily impacted by the level of comparable store sales growth 
based on these factors  we currently expect diluted net income per common share will be between and for fiscal  compared to in fiscal results of operations net sales our net sales in fiscal were billion  an increase of approximately million  as compared with an increase of approximately million in fiscal the increases in fiscal and in fiscal were attributable  in part  to increased sales in comparable stores stores open more than months of million and million  respectively  with the balance of the increases primarily relating to sales from new stores opened as part of our store growth program 
sales during fiscal were negatively impacted by the loss of one week during the reporting period  as discussed above 
in fiscal  the customer count  as measured by the number of register transactions in comparable stores  was approximately flat  and the average customer transaction increased approximately to  compared to fiscal we continue to believe that our customer is consolidating trips in response to economic pressures and the volatility of gasoline prices 
in fiscal  the customer count decreased slightly and the average transaction increased approximately compared to fiscal sales during fiscal were strongest in consumables  driven primarily by sales of food in connection with our food strategy 
sales of more discretionary merchandise  including apparel and accessories  home products  and seasonal and electronics  were weaker 
see item business merchandise elsewhere in this report for a breakdown of the percentage of sales attributable to each product category during the last three fiscal years 
sales during fiscal were strongest in consumables  driven primarily by sales of food resulting from the implementation of our food strategy  and were weaker in apparel and accessories and home products 
sales of seasonal and electronics were impacted by increased sales of prepaid services  which are recorded on a net basis only the markup on the sales of prepaid services is recorded as revenue 
during fiscal  we opened stores and closed stores for a net addition of stores  compared with the opening of stores and closing of stores for a net addition of stores during fiscal we also expanded or relocated stores in fiscal  compared with stores that were expanded or relocated in fiscal in addition  we renovated stores in fiscal  compared with stores that were renovated in fiscal during challenging environments  our customers are especially sensitive to promotions as they manage with less spending capacity 
we increased our advertising efforts during fiscal to emphasize the value we offer on both consumable and discretionary merchandise 
advertising costs  net of co op recoveries from vendors were million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we traditionally advertise through circulars available in stores or circulars that are inserted in newspapers or mailed directly to consumers residences 
in addition  we use limited advertising  including radio and grand opening circulars  to support the opening of new stores 
cost of sales cost of sales increased approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal and approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal these increases primarily reflected the additional sales volume in each of the years 
cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  during fiscal  was due primarily to increased sales of lower margin consumable merchandise 
the decrease in cost of sales  as a percentage of net sales  during fiscal compared with fiscal  was due to the effect of an increase in sales of prepaid services  which are reported on a net basis  a more favorable merchandise sales mix  better merchandise markup and lower inventory shrinkage 
these improvements were partially offset by higher markdown expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a expenses increased approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal  and approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increases in these expenses were attributable primarily to additional costs arising from the continued growth in the number of stores in operation 
sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  during fiscal  was due primarily to an increase in occupancy costs approximately of net sales and an increase in advertising costs approximately of net sales 
in addition  most costs in fiscal were de leveraged as a result of the low single digit comparable store sales growth 
these increases offset a decrease in insurance costs approximately of net sales and a decrease in professional fees approximately of net sales 
the increase in occupancy costs was primarily a result of changes in accrual estimates 
in connection with the implementation of our new lease administration system and the increased visibility to the underlying lease information  we refined our accrual estimates related to store rental expenses 
advertising costs increased as we began to increase our marketing efforts during fiscal with respect to insurance costs  as we have worked to improve processes  inventory productivity  and store manager retention  we have experienced favorable trends in workers compensation and general liability claims  resulting in a decrease in our actuarily determined insurance liabilities 
costs associated with the stockholder derivative actions during fiscal were not incurred during fiscal  resulting in a year over year decrease in professional fees 
the increase in sg a expenses  as a percentage of net sales  in fiscal compared with fiscal  was due primarily to low single digit comparable store sales growth  the effect of an increase in sales of prepaid services  increased professional fees  and increased occupancy costs 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in insurance costs 
litigation charge during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million a net impact of approximately per diluted share litigation charge associated with an adverse litigation judgment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information 
all other legal expenses during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  including our defense costs related to the above referenced case  were recorded in sg a 
interest income interest income increased approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal and approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal the increase in was not material 
the increase in fiscal was due to an increase in interest rates and an increase in investment securities 
interest expense interest expense decreased approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal and increased approximately million in fiscal compared with fiscal the decrease in fiscal was due to an accounting policy change in the classification of tax related interest and penalties in connection with our adoption of fin tax related interest and penalties were included in interest expense during fiscal the increase in interest expense during fiscal was due primarily to interest on taxes resulting from the internal revenue service examination of our consolidated federal income tax returns for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal and interest on state income taxes 
income taxes the effective tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal compared with fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in the company s tax liabilities as a result of the expiration of certain statute of limitations with respect to uncertain tax positions and favorable settlements with taxing authorities 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal compared with fiscal was a result of the positive impact of a retroactive reinstatement of federal jobs tax credits  an increase in tax exempt interest income  and the effect of changes in reserves for state income tax contingencies 
liquidity and capital resources we have consistently maintained a strong liquidity position 
cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was million as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal these amounts have enabled us to fund our regular operating needs  capital expenditure program  cash dividend payments  and interest payments  as well as a significant portion of our share repurchases 
on january   we entered into an additional unsecured revolving credit facility with a syndicate of lenders for short term borrowings of up to million 
the credit facility has an initial term of days and includes two one year extensions that require lender consent 
the credit facility also includes a one year term out option that does not require lender consent 
any borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates 
the new credit facility noted above is in addition to our million unsecured revolving credit facility expiring on august  outstanding standby letters of credit million as of august  reduce the borrowing capacity of the million facility 
the million facility also bears interest at a variable rate based on short term market interest rates 
during fiscal  we borrowed and repaid a total of million under our credit facilities  compared with million during fiscal the maximum outstanding borrowing amount during fiscal was million 
we had no borrowings against our credit facilities during fiscal the borrowings during fiscal were used to meet short term liquidity needs resulting from seasonal inventory purchases and liquidity issues related to our investments in auction rate securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our auction rate securities 
the borrowings during fiscal were used to meet short term liquidity needs resulting from the formation of our captive insurance subsidiary 
during fiscal  the credit facilities accrued interest at an average rate of 
as of august   the company had no outstanding borrowings under the credit facilities 
the credit facilities contain certain restrictive financial covenants  which include a consolidated debt to consolidated capitalization ratio  a fixed charge coverage ratio  and a priority debt to consolidated net worth ratio 
as of august   the company was in compliance with all such covenants 
our inventories at the end of fiscal were lower than at the end of fiscal inventory per store at the end of fiscal was approximately lower than inventory per store at the end of fiscal  excluding merchandise in transit to the distribution centers 
we continue to focus on inventory productivity and have worked aggressively to limit our inventory risk in more discretionary merchandise categories 
merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal were higher than at the end of fiscal the increase in merchandise inventories was due primarily to the additional inventory resulting from net new stores 
inventory on a per store basis at the end of fiscal was approximately lower than at the end of fiscal  excluding merchandise in transit to the distribution centers 
the decrease in inventory on a per store basis during fiscal resulted from our continued focus on inventory productivity 
capital expenditures for fiscal were million  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in capital expenditures during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to an increase in existing store improvements and upgrades and an increase in technology investments 
the decrease in capital expenditures during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due primarily to a decrease in the number of new stores opened during fiscal as compared to fiscal and lower distribution and transportation investments 
offsetting some of the decrease was an increase in expenditures related to technology investments 
capital expenditures for fiscal are expected to be between million and million and relate primarily to new store openings  existing store expansions  relocations and renovations  distribution center improvements  and expenditures related to store technology infrastructure 
capital spending plans  including store opening plans  are continuously reviewed and are subject to change 
cash flow from current operations is expected to be sufficient to meet planned liquidity and operational capital resource needs  including store expansion and other capital spending programs and share repurchases 
in addition  as previously discussed  we have available two revolving credit facilities 
during fiscal  we purchased million shares of our common stock at a cost of million

as of the end of fiscal  these cash and cash equivalents and investment securities balances were million and million  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities increased million compared to fiscal  primarily due to changes in merchandise inventories and other working capital items in the ordinary course of business 
merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal were lower than at the end of fiscal merchandise inventories at the end of fiscal were higher than at the end of fiscal the change in the deferred income taxes  the income tax refund receivable  and income tax liabilities relate primarily to changes in the tax deductibility of insurance loss reserves in connection with the formation of our captive insurance subsidiary as well as reclassifications due to the implementation of fin cash flows from investing activities cash used for investing activities increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was due primarily to the increase in capital expenditures  as discussed above 
the increase in capital expenditures was substantially offset by a decrease in the net purchase sale of investment securities  which resulted from the liquidity issues in the auction rate securities market 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our auction rate securities 
cash flows from financing activities cash used in financing activities increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily a result of a decrease in cash overdrafts as a result of the timing of payments at year end and a decrease in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
lower expenditures related to stock repurchases offset some of the increase 
the following table shows our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations at the end of fiscal payments due during the period ending in thousands contractual obligations total august august august august august thereafter long term debt interest merchandise letters of credit operating leases construction obligations minimum royalties total at the end of fiscal  approximately million of the merchandise letters of credit were included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
most of our operating leases provide us with an option to extend the term of the lease at designated rates 
see item properties in this report 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted fin  which clarifies the accounting for income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
in accordance with fin  we have recorded million in liabilities related to our uncertain tax positions as of august  at this time  we cannot reasonably determine the timing of any payments related to these liabilities  except for million which were classified as current liabilities and may become payable within the next months 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our adoption of fin the following table shows our other commercial commitments at the end of fiscal other commercial commitments in thousands total amounts committed standby letters of credit surety bonds total a substantial portion of the outstanding amount of standby letters of credit which are primarily renewed on an annual basis is used as surety for future premium and deductible payments to our workers compensation and general liability insurance carrier

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin provides guidance regarding the recognition and measurement of tax positions and the related reporting and disclosure requirements 
we adopted fin during the first quarter of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for the first annual period ending after november  the effective date has been delayed for non financial assets and liabilities to the first annual period ending after november  we do not currently believe that sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits all entities the option to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
if a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item  then it will report unrealized gains and losses on those items at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not plan to elect the fair value option under sfas in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas 
sfas identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states the gaap hierarchy 
sfas is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
we do not currently believe that sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting principles are critical because they involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories our inventories are valued using the retail method  based on retail prices less mark on percentages  which approximates the lower of first in  first out fifo cost or market 
we record adjustments to inventory through cost of goods sold when retail price reductions  or markdowns  are taken against on hand inventory 
in addition  we make estimates and judgments regarding  among other things  initial markups  markdowns  future demand for specific product categories and market conditions  all of which can significantly impact inventory valuation 
these estimates and judgments are based on the application of a consistent methodology each period 
while we believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for these components  if actual demand or market conditions are different than our projections  it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded estimates 
this risk is generally higher for seasonal merchandise than for non seasonal merchandise 
we estimate inventory losses for damaged  lost or stolen inventory inventory shrinkage for the period from the most recent physical inventory to the financial statement date 
the accrual for estimated inventory shrinkage is based on the trailing twelve month actual inventory shrinkage rate 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation of inventory during fiscal property and equipment we state property and equipment at cost 
we calculate depreciation for financial reporting purposes using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
for leasehold improvements  this depreciation is over the shorter of the term of the related lease generally five years or the asset s useful economic life 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful depreciable lives involves significant judgments and the use of estimates 
we generally do not assign salvage value to property and equipment 
we review property and equipment for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
historically  our impairment losses on fixed assets  which typically relate to normal store closings  have not been material to our financial position and results of operations 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions related to the valuation and classification of property and equipment during fiscal insurance liabilities we are primarily self insured for health care  property loss  workers compensation  and general liability costs 
these costs are significant primarily due to the large number of our retail locations and associates 
our self insurance liabilities are based on the total estimated costs of claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported  less amounts paid against such claims  and are not discounted 
we review current and historical claims data in developing our estimates 
we also use information provided by outside actuaries with respect to medical  workers compensation and general liability claims 
the insurance liabilities we record are mainly influenced by changes in payroll expense  sales  number of vehicles  and the frequency and severity of claims 
the estimates of more recent claims are more volatile and more likely to change than older claims 
if the underlying facts and circumstances of the claims change or the historical trend is not indicative of future trends  then we may be required to record additional expense or a reduction to expense which could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal  our insurance expense was favorably impacted by reductions in our actuarily determined insurance liabilities  resulting from favorable trends in workers compensation and general liability claims 
see our sg a discussion above for more information 
contingent income tax liabilities we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business 
our contingent income tax liabilities are estimated based on the methodology prescribed in fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which we adopted as of the beginning of fiscal fin prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities as well as by current income tax trends 
if circumstances change  we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on our adoption of fin contingent legal liabilities we are involved in numerous legal proceedings and claims 
our accruals  if any  related to these proceedings and claims are based on a determination of whether or not the loss is both probable and estimable 
we review outstanding claims and proceedings with external counsel to assess probability and estimates of loss 
we re evaluate the claims and proceedings each quarter or as new and significant information becomes available  and we adjust or establish accruals  if necessary 
if circumstances change  we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine contingent legal liabilities during fiscal stock based compensation expense we adopted sfas r during the first quarter of fiscal sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based awards made to employees based on estimated fair values 
the determination of the fair value of employee stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we also grant performance share rights and adjust compensation expense each quarter based on the ultimate number of shares expected to be issued 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense recorded under sfas r may differ significantly from the amount recorded in the current period 
there were no material changes in the estimates or assumptions used to determine stock based compensation during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on sfas r 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing and cash management activities 
we maintain unsecured revolving credit facilities at variable rates of interest to meet the short term needs of our expansion program and seasonal inventory increases 
during fiscal  we incurred million in interest expense related to our credit facilities 
interest incurred during fiscal and fiscal related to our credit facilities was not material 
our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates 
our investment securities currently include auction rate securities that are subject to failed auctions and are not currently liquid 
as of august   we recorded a million unrealized loss million net of taxes related to these investments and classified them as long term assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
we believe that we will be able to liquidate our auction rate securities at par at some point in the future as a result of issuer refinancings  settlements with broker dealers  or upon maturity 
however  volatility in the credit markets could continue to negatively impact the timing of future liquidity related to these investments and lead to additional adjustments to their carrying value
