overview we offer technology based services and systems that enable enterprises to improve their mobile and online business performance and communications technologies 
we offer internet test and measurement services internet  and mobile test and measurement services mobile 
our internet category includes all of our geographically distributed web site and application monitoring and measurement services  voice over ip and streaming measurement services  load testing services  customer experience management services  competitive research and industry scorecard services  and other professional services 
the mobile category consists of our on demand mobile monitoring and testing services  our global roamer services and our sigos system integrated test environment site systems 
we believe all of these categories of services help our customers reduce costs  improve customer satisfaction and increase profitability 
we offer our internet services primarily on a subscription basis and on an engagement basis although  in some cases  we offer internet professional services on a per incident or per study basis 
we also offer the self service use of our internet technology for a fixed period of time on a subscription basis 
subscription fees range from monthly to annual commitments  and vary based on the type of service selected  the number of pages  transactions or devices monitored  the number of measurement locations and or appliances  the frequency of the measurements and any additional features ordered 
engagements typically involve fixed price contracts based on the complexity of the project  the size of a panel  and the type of testing to be conducted 
our mobile solutions are offered on a subscription basis or license basis 
the subscriptions typically are for a fixed period  usually annual  and are based on the number of locations and devices from which monitoring and testing is performed  and the number of mobile operators and services covered by such monitoring and testing 
the sigos site system is usually offered via a software license fee model  but because it is bundled with ongoing maintenance and support for a fixed contract period  the license fees are amortized over the length of the contract and are therefore included in ratable license revenue 
the sigos global roamer service is offered via a subscription fee model typically on a three to twelve month basis and included in subscription services revenue 
our net loss decreased by approximately million  from a net loss of approximately million for the year ended september  to a net loss of approximately million for the year ended september  total net revenue increased by approximately million or  from approximately million for the year ended september  to approximately million for the year ended september  the increase in total net revenue was primarily attributable to an increased contribution from our ratable licenses revenue of approximately million which represents sales of our sigos site systems 
total expenses increased by approximately million or  from approximately million for the year ended september  to approximately million for the year ended september  approximately million of the increase in total expenses was mainly attributable to increased investment in our sales force and increased costs associated with our sales and marketing events that occurred in fiscal year approximately million of the increase in total expenses is attributable to an increase in costs of ratable licenses associated with 
table of contents higher ratable licenses revenue generated from existing customers renewing existing maintenance contracts as well as new and existing customers purchasing additional site systems which revenue is being recorded as ratable licenses revenue 
we anticipate that total expenses for the first quarter of fiscal will be comparable to the fourth quarter of fiscal for the year ended september   our largest customers accounted for approximately of total net revenue 
we cannot be certain that customers that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or in aggregate  will renew our services and continue to generate revenue in any future period 
in addition  our customers that have monthly renewal arrangements may terminate their services at any time with little or no penalty 
if we lose a major customer or a group of significant customers  our revenue could significantly decline 
we believe that the challenges for our business include continuing to drive growth in our internet and mobile revenue  growing multiple page broadband related revenue such as transaction perspective and application perspective  continuing to control our expenses for fiscal  and successfully navigating the economic global downturn 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that have a significant effect on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance inventories and inventory valuation allocation of purchase price for business combinations goodwill  identifiable intangible assets  and long lived assets stock based compensation income taxes  deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition sab  emerging issues task force eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition sop  and the eitf issue  applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software eitf 
we generally recognize revenue when all of the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product or service  fee is fixed and determinable and collection is deemed reasonably assured 

table of contents one of the critical judgments that we make is the assessment that collectibility is probable 
our recognition of revenue is based on our assessment of the probability of collecting the related accounts receivable on a customer by customer basis 
if we determine that collection is not reasonably assured  then revenue is deferred and recognized upon the receipt of cash from that arrangement 
our revenue consists of subscription services revenue  ratable license revenue and professional services revenue 
subscription services revenue subscription services revenue consists of fees from sales of subscriptions to our perspective family of services and global roamer 
subscription service revenue is recognized in accordance with sab and eitf we also enter into multiple element arrangements where sufficient objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the allocation of revenue 
as a result  the elements within our subscription arrangements do not qualify for treatment as separate units of accounting 
accordingly  we account for fees received under subscription arrangements as a single unit of accounting and recognize the entire arrangement fee as revenue either ratably over the service period  generally over twelve months  or based upon actual monthly usage 
for customers that are billed the entire amount of their subscription in advance  subscription services revenue is deferred upon invoicing and is recognized ratably over the service period  generally ranging from one to twelve months  commencing on the day service is first provided 
for customers that are billed on a monthly basis  revenue is recognized monthly based upon actual service usage for the month 
regardless of when billing occurs  we recognize revenue as services are provided and defer any revenue that is unearned 
webeffective service is sold on a subscription basis or as part of a professional services engagement 
we recognize revenue from the use of our webeffective service that is sold on a subscription basis ratably over the subscription period  commencing on the day service is first provided  and such revenue is recorded as subscription services revenue 
we recognize revenue from the use of our webeffective service as part of a professional services engagement and revenue is recorded as professional services revenue 
ratable licenses revenue ratable licenses revenue consists of fees from the sale of mobile automated test equipment  maintenance  engineering and minor consulting services associated with keynote sigos system integrated test environment site as a result of our acquisition of sigos systemintegration gmbh keynote sigos in the third quarter of fiscal we frequently enter into multiple element arrangements with mobile customers for the sale of our automated test equipment  including both hardware and software licenses  consulting services to configure the hardware and software implementation or integration services  post contract support maintenance services  training services and other minor consulting services 
these multiple element arrangements are within the scope of sop  and eitf this determination is based on the hardware component of our multiple element arrangements being deemed to be a software related element 
in addition  customers only purchase the software and hardware as a package  with payments due upon delivery of this hardware and software package 
none of the keynote sigos implementation integration services provided by us are considered to be essential to the functionality of the licensed products 
this assessment is due to the implementation integration services being performed during a relatively short period generally within two to three months compared to the length of the arrangement which typically ranges from twelve to thirty six months 
additionally  the implementation integration services are general in nature and we have a history of successfully gaining customer acceptance 
we cannot allocate the arrangement consideration to the multiple elements based on the vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value since sufficient vsoe does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement  typically maintenance 
therefore  we recognize the entire arrangement fee into revenue ratably over the maintenance period  historically ranging from twelve to thirty six months  once the implementation and integration services are completed  usually within two to three months following the delivery of the hardware and software 
where acceptance provisions exist in the arrangement the ratable recognition of revenue begins when evidence of customer acceptance of the software and hardware has occurred as intended under the respective arrangement s contractual terms 

table of contents professional services revenue professional services revenue consists of fees generated from our loadpro  cem and professional consulting services that are purchased as part of a professional service project 
revenue from these services is recognized as the services are performed  typically over a period of one to three months 
for professional service projects that contain milestones  we recognize revenue once the services or milestones have been delivered  based on input measures 
payment occurs either up front or over time 
we also enter into multiple element arrangements that generally consist of either the combination of subscription and professional services or multiple professional services 
for these arrangements  we recognize revenue in accordance with eitf we allocate and defer revenue for the undelivered items based on objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue 
when sufficient objective evidence of fair value does not exist for undelivered items when subscription and professional services are combined  the entire arrangement fee is recognized ratably over the applicable performance period 
deferred revenue deferred revenue is comprised of all unearned revenue that has been collected in advance  primarily unearned license and subscription services revenue  and is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet until the revenue is earned 
the addback of unpaid deferred revenue may change at any point in time as it is based upon the timing of when invoices are collected and whether there is any unpaid deferred revenue associated with such accounts receivable 
short term deferred revenue represents the unearned revenue that has been collected in advance that will be earned within twelve months of the balance sheet date 
correspondingly  long term deferred revenue  which primarily consists of keynote sigos revenue  represents the unearned revenue that will be earned after twelve months of the balance sheet date 
we generally do not grant refunds 
all discounts granted reduce revenue 
free trials are occasionally provided to prospective customers who would like to try certain of our perspective and other subscription services before they commit to purchasing the services 
the services provided during the trial period are typically stand alone transactions and are not bundled with other services 
revenue is not recognized for these free trial periods 
the table below represents the balances of gross deferred revenue short term and long term aggregated as of september  and the addback to net deferred revenue which represents the deferred revenue balance as recorded on the consolidated balance sheets represents the unpaid deferred revenue that has an associated accounts receivable balance as of the balance sheet dates 
the addback of unpaid deferred revenue may change at any point in time as it is based upon the timing of when invoices are collected and whether there is any unpaid deferred revenue associated with such accounts receivable 
domestic international total net deferred revenue addback unpaid deferred revenue gross deferred revenue at september  net deferred revenue addback unpaid deferred revenue gross deferred revenue at september  allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical trends  experience and current market and industry conditions 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the age of each invoice of the accounts receivable aging  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review invoices greater than days past due to determine whether an allowance is appropriate based on the receivable balance 
in addition  we maintain a reserve for all other invoices  which is calculated by applying a percentage  based on historical collection trends  to the outstanding accounts receivable balance as well as specifically identified accounts that are deemed uncollectible 

table of contents billing allowance represents the reserve for potential billing adjustments that are recorded as a reduction of revenue and represents a percentage of revenue based on historical trends and experience 
the allowance for doubtful accounts and billing allowance represent management s best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable and billing adjustments  including unforeseen declines in market conditions and collection rates and the number of billing adjustments  may result in additional allowances in the future or reductions in allowances due to future recoveries or trends 
inventories and inventory valuation inventories related to sigos site systems were approximately million as of september   and relate to direct costs associated with finished goods hardware 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out basis or market 
market is based on estimated replacement value 
determining market value of inventories involves numerous judgments  including average selling prices and sales volumes of future periods 
we primarily utilize current selling prices for measuring any potential declines in market value below cost 
any adjustment for market value is charged to direct cost of ratable licenses at the point of market value decline 
we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence on a quarterly basis 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical and forecasted sales of our product 
inventories on hand in excess of forecasted demand are provided for 
in addition  we write off inventories that are considered obsolete 
obsolescence is determined from several factors  including competitiveness of product offerings  market conditions  and product life cycles 
our inventories include mainly computer hardware and mobile hardware and accessories that may be subject to technological obsolescence 
our products are sold in a competitive industry 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than we estimate  we may be required to take inventory write downs 
for the years ended september   and  we did not experience any write down of inventories 
allocation of purchase price for business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as well as any in process research and development ipr d  based on their estimated fair values 
our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to acquisitions is usually determined based on management s assessment in conjunction with valuations performed by an independent third party 
such a valuation requires making significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain intangible assets include  but are not limited to  future expected cash flows from customer contracts  customer lists and acquired developed technologies  expected costs to develop ipr d into commercially viable products and estimating cash flows from projects when completed and discount rates 
estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and  as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
other estimates such as accruals associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change as additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
goodwill  identifiable intangibles assets  and long lived assets goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
we evaluate our identifiable goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable for our single operating segment 
in addition we evaluate our intangible assets and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  
table of contents significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
management continually applies its judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted net cash flows used to assess recoverability of the intangible assets and the fair value of the asset group 
if future events or circumstances indicate that an impairment assessment is required and an asset group is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
we performed an annual goodwill and long lived assets impairment review during the fourth quarter in fiscal   and we did not record an impairment charge based on our reviews 
the goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of september  was approximately million as compared to million as of september  if our estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge on goodwill to reduce its carrying amount to its estimated fair value 
if future events or circumstances indicate that an impairment assessment is required on intangible or long lived assets and an asset group is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods 
stock based compensation we issue stock options to our employees and outside directors and provide our employees the right to purchase common stock under employee stock purchase plans 
since october   we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service vesting period 
the value of an option is estimated using the black scholes option valuation model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
a change in our assumptions could materially affect the fair value estimate  and thus  the total calculated costs associated with the grant of stock options or the issue of stock under employee stock purchase plans 
if actual forfeiture rates differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for more detail 
income taxes  deferred income tax assets and deferred income tax liabilities we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liabilities  including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recoverable from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase the valuation allowance in a period  our deferred tax expense increases 
if a valuation allowance is decreased  deferred tax expense may be reduced  goodwill may be reduced  or paid in capital may be increased  depending on the nature and source of the deferred tax assets 
this analysis is applied on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
tax planning strategies may be implemented which would affect the tax rate 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual income before taxes can affect the overall effective tax rate 
we perform an analysis of our effective tax rate and we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets quarterly 
the uncertainties which could affect the realization of our deferred tax assets include various factors such as the amount of deductions for tax purposes related to our stock options  potential successful challenges to the deferred tax assets by taxing authorities  and a mismatch of the period during which the type of taxable income and 
table of contents the deferred tax assets are realized or a mismatch in the tax jurisdiction in which taxable income is generated and the company with the deferred tax assets 
as of october   we adopted financial accounting standards board s interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin to account for uncertain tax positions 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin is a two step process 
the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
during the three months ended december   we entered into an agreement whereby we purchased certain intangible assets from our german subsidiary 
this transaction was treated as an inter company sale and  as such  tax is not recognized on the sale until we no longer benefit from the underlying asset 
therefore  we recorded a long term prepaid tax asset of approximately million which represents the tax that the german subsidiary will pay of approximately million  offset by the elimination of the remaining carrying amount of the deferred tax liability that was established on the transferred assets at the time of the acquisition of the german subsidiary related to the sale of these intangible assets 
the deferred tax liability had a carrying amount of approximately million at the time of the transfer 
we are amortizing the net prepaid tax asset of approximately million through tax expense over the life of the underlying asset which has been estimated to be months 
as of september   the prepaid tax asset was approximately million  net of amortization of  the prepaid tax asset is recorded as deferred costs and other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
we establish liabilities or reserves when we believe that certain tax positions are not probable of being sustained if challenged  despite our belief that our tax returns are fully supportable 
we evaluate these tax reserves and related interest each quarter and adjust the reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances regarding the probability of realizing tax benefits  such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations 
we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax laws and that we have adequately provided for known material tax contingencies  however  due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty relating to tax matters  including the likelihood and potential outcome of any tax audits  management is not able to estimate the range of reasonably possible losses in excess of amounts recorded

subscription services revenue consists of fees from subscriptions from our traditional perspective measurements  monitoring  testing  diagnostic  competitive research and industry scorecard services and global roamer services 

table of contents revenue from subscription services increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in subscription services revenue for the year ended september  over the corresponding period in fiscal was mainly attributable to increased sales of our multiple page broadband subscription services of approximately million and global roamer and other mobile subscription services of approximately million  offset by a decrease in our single page single device subscription services of approximately million 
revenue from subscription services increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in subscription services revenue for the year ended september  over the corresponding period in fiscal was mainly attributable to increased sales of our multiple page broadband subscription services of approximately million and global roamer services of approximately million  offset by a decrease in our single page single device subscription services of approximately million 
we measured  for revenue based upon the average for the month  over   and  page measurements during the month of september  and  respectively 
subscription services fees can vary based on the number of pages measured  the number of devices monitored  the number of measurement locations  the number of users  the number of hours  the frequency of the measurements  the number of private agents  the additional features ordered  and the type of services purchased 
we believe that subscription services revenue may increase in the future as a percentage of total net revenue 
however  we cannot assure you that this revenue will increase in absolute dollars in future periods 
we have been replacing single page single device subscriptions with our multiple page broadband services and have achieved our goal of reducing single page single device subscriptions revenue to less than of internet subscription revenue since the third quarter of fiscal ratable licenses 
ratable licenses revenue consists of sales of mobile automated test equipment  maintenance  support  engineering and minor consulting services associated with sigos site 
revenue from ratable licenses increased approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase was primarily due to revenue growth from the sale of new sigos site systems 
all sales are being recognized as revenue over the maintenance period for each contract which is typically twelve to thirty six months 
we expect revenue growth for ratable licenses will be much less than experienced in fiscal year this is primarily attributable to the amount of revenue being recognized from prior periods normalizing with new sales contracts that will be amortized over twelve to thirty six months 
revenue from ratable licenses increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase was primarily due to a full year of revenue in fiscal as compared to six months in fiscal since our acquisition of keynote sigos occurred in the second half of fiscal in addition to keynote sigos contributing revenue for twelve months  we experienced revenue growth from the sale of new sigos site systems and existing customers renewing maintenance agreements 
all sales are being recognized as revenue over the maintenance period for each contract which is typically twelve to thirty six months 
professional services 
revenue from professional services decreased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the decrease in revenue was primarily due to fewer customer experience management engagements and load testing engagements 
revenue from professional services decreased slightly by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the decrease in revenue was primarily due to decreased revenue of approximately million from customer experience management engagements and competitive studies  offset partially by approximately million from other consulting engagements

total internet revenue remained relatively flat for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  total mobile revenue increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in mobile revenue for the year ended september  over the corresponding period in fiscal  was mainly attributable to revenue growth from the sale of new sigos site systems and existing customers renewing maintenance agreements of approximately million 
in addition  the increase in mobile revenue  to a lesser extent  is attributable to increased growth from our mobile subscription services 
total mobile revenue increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in mobile revenue for the year ended september  over the corresponding period in fiscal  was mainly attributable to the addition of sigos revenue for twelve months in fiscal as compared to six months in fiscal due to the acquisition of sigos on april  the following table shows types of revenue as a percentage of total net revenue for the year ended september total internet revenue total mobile revenue total net revenue for the years ended september  and  no single customer accounted for more than of total net revenue

costs and expenses direct costs of subscription services  ratable licenses and professional services change change in thousands direct costs of subscription services direct costs of ratable licenses direct costs of professional services direct costs of subscription services 
direct costs of subscription services consist of connection fees to major telecommunication and internet access providers for bandwidth usage of our measurement computers  which are located around the world  depreciation  maintenance and other equipment charges for our measurement and data collection infrastructure and global roamer services 
direct costs of subscription services decreased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  and represented and of subscription services revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
total direct costs of subscription services for the year ended september  was comparable to the year ended september  the decrease in direct costs of subscription services as a percentage of subscription revenue is primarily due to the fact that there was higher revenue recognized in fiscal without incremental associated direct costs of subscription services 
we do not anticipate that direct costs of subscription services for the first quarter of fiscal will change significantly in absolute dollars compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents direct costs of subscription services increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  and represented and of subscription services revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
this increase was primarily due to increased costs associated with our mobile device perspective services and mobile application perspective services related to building our mobile infrastructure that will allow small and medium size mobile content developers to test their mobile content 
in addition  we increased the number of locations of our probes for our global roamer services from cities as of september  to cities as of september   of the increase was related to increased costs for bandwidth  co location and depreciation due to associated higher mobile revenue 
 of the increase was attributable to increased depreciation and equipment charges  and connection fees related to additional measurement computers as well as replacing existing measurement computers related to our mobile services 
direct costs of ratable licenses 
direct costs of ratable licenses include cost of materials  supplies  maintenance  support personnel related costs  which include stock based compensation  and consulting costs mainly related to the sale of our sigos site systems 
direct costs of ratable licenses increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  and represented and of ratable licenses revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to test equipment sold as part of each site system contract 
the cost of this equipment is being expensed ratably over the same twelve to thirty six months period as the revenue to which it is associated 
the decrease in direct costs of ratable licenses as a percentage of the ratable license revenue is primarily due to the fact that there was higher revenue being recognized in fiscal for maintenance renewals that did not have any significant associated direct costs 
we do not anticipate that direct costs of ratable licenses for the first quarter of fiscal will change significantly in absolute dollars compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal direct costs of ratable licenses increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  and represented and of ratable licenses revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily related to the inclusion of costs for twelve months in fiscal as compared to six months in fiscal since keynote sigos was acquired in april the increase was also attributable to test equipment sold as part of each new customer contract 
the cost of this equipment is being expensed ratably over the same twelve to thirty six months period as the revenue to which it is associated 
the decrease in direct costs of ratable licenses as a percentage of ratable license revenue is due to containing costs for personnel and consulting associated with customer support and new customer deployment relatively constant in fiscal year direct costs of professional services 
direct costs of professional services consist of compensation expenses  which includes stock based compensation  and other related costs for professional services personnel  external consulting expenses to deliver our professional services revenue  panel and reward costs associated with our customer experience management engagements and competitive research and industry scorecard services  all load testing bandwidth costs and related network infrastructure costs 
direct costs of professional services decreased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  and represented and of professional service revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the decrease in direct costs of professional services was primarily due to lower personnel related costs associated with our customer experience management services due to stringent cost containment 
in addition  the decrease in costs of professional services was due to lower consulting expenses that were incurred in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal due to a specific customer engagement 
the increase in direct costs of professional services as a percentage of professional services is due to lower professional services revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal we do not anticipate that direct costs of professional services for the first quarter of fiscal will change significantly in absolute dollars compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal direct costs of professional services decreased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  and represented and of professional service revenue for 
table of contents the years ended september  and  respectively 
the decrease in direct costs of professional services was primarily due to lower personnel related costs associated with our internet services due to stringent cost containment as well as lower panel and reward costs due to lower demand in internet engagements 
the decrease was offset slightly by an increase of  related to our internet engagements which experienced increased external consulting expenses related to an increase in custom projects 
development change change in thousands development development expenses consist primarily of compensation  which includes stock based compensation  and other related costs for development personnel 
development expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september   of the increase is primarily attributable to additional headcount of throughout the year

during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we purchased and capitalized intangible assets of approximately million 
we expect to amortize the intellectual property  upon the completion of the application development stage  which management anticipates will be completed in the third quarter of fiscal there were no capitalized development costs for the years ended september    and we do not anticipate that development expenses for the first quarter of fiscal will change significantly in absolute dollars compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal development expenses increased by million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  this increase was primarily attributable to twelve months of costs associated with keynote sigos in fiscal as compared to six months in fiscal operations change change in thousands operations operations expenses consist primarily of compensation  which includes stock based compensation  and other related costs for management and technical support personnel who manage and maintain our field measurement and collection infrastructure and headquarters data center  and provide basic and extended customer support 
our operations personnel also work closely with other departments to assure the reliability of our services

we believe that continued investments in our sales and marketing efforts are essential for us to maintain our market position and to further increase acceptance of our services 
we do not anticipate that sales and marketing expenses for the first quarter of fiscal will change significantly in absolute dollars compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal our sales and marketing expenses increased by approximately million for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  approximately million of the increase was attributable to twelve months of keynote sigos costs being included in fiscal as compared to six months in fiscal the remaining increase was primarily related to increased headcount of sales personnel and related costs as a result of our continued investment in our sales organization

our general and administrative expenses increased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  general and administrative expenses increased by  primarily attributable to increased headcount and personnel related costs 
the increase was offset by decreased spending in professional fees in fiscal as compared to fiscal we anticipate that general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will increase as compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal due to higher professional fees 
our general and administrative expenses increased slightly by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  our general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million due to twelve months of keynote sigos expenses in fiscal as compared to six months of expenses in fiscal and to a lesser extent  higher personnel costs related to additional headcount 
the increase was offset by a decrease of approximately million in expenses related to a reduction in audit related and compliance fees 
excess occupancy income change change in thousands rental income rental and other expenses excess occupancy income excess occupancy income consists of rental income from the leasing of space not occupied by us in our headquarters building  net of related fixed costs  such as property taxes  insurance  building depreciation  leasing broker fees  and tenant improvement amortization 
the costs are based on the actual square footage available for lease to third parties  which was approximately for the year ended september  and for the years ended september  and the increase in excess occupancy income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in tenant income of approximately million due to the leasing of additional space  offset by a net increase in expenses of  we expect the excess occupancy income will be approximately the same in the first quarter of fiscal as the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents the increase in excess occupancy income in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase in tenant income of approximately  due to the leasing of additional space  offset by a net increase in expenses of  amortization of identifiable intangible assets and in process research and development change change in thousands amortization of identifiable intangible assets software amortization of identifiable intangible assets other in process research and development costs n a total amortization of identifiable intangible assets and in process research and development total amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal primarily due to intangible assets purchased in the zandan acquisition 
the amortization of intangible assets software mainly relates to our keynote sigos developed technology related to our sigos site system and to a lesser extent to zandan s developed technology related to mobile  and is reflected in direct costs of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
total amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the corresponding period in fiscal primarily due to twelve months of amortization related to our keynote sigos acquisition in fiscal as compared to six months of amortization in fiscal the increase in amortization was slightly offset by certain intangibles becoming fully amortized in the second half of fiscal amortization of intangible assets software relates to our keynote sigos developed technology related to our sigos site system and is reflected in costs of revenue in our consolidated statements of operations 
we review our identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
at september   we had a remaining balance of approximately million of identifiable intangible assets that are being amortized over a two to six and one half year expected life 
we expect the amortization of identifiable intangible assets to be approximately  for the first quarter of fiscal  assuming no additional acquisitions or impairment charges

interest income and interest and other expenses  net  increased by  for the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the increase in interest income  and interest and other expenses  net  was primarily attributable to slightly increased investment yields resulting from higher balance of invested cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
provision for income taxes change change in thousands provision for income taxes although we had a loss before income taxes  for the year ended september   we recorded a net tax expense of approximately million 
for the year ended september   we recorded a net tax expense of approximately million 
our effective tax rate for the year ended september  was approximately including the effect of the adjustment of the valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of the year  we recorded deferred income tax expense of approximately million associated with an increase in the valuation allowance against our net deferred assets 
this increase was primarily due to net loss incurred in fiscal and recent history of losses the tax rate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to nondeductible stock option compensation charges related to incentive stock options  foreign tax differential  amortization on prepaid tax asset and the change in our valuation allowance 
we establish liabilities or reserves when we believe that certain tax positions are likely to be challenged and we may not succeed  despite our belief that our tax returns are fully supportable 
we adjust these reserves  as well as related interest  in light of changing circumstances such as the progress of tax examinations and the expiration of the statute of limitations 
we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million  available to reduce future income subject to income taxes 
the federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire  if not utilized  in the years through in addition  we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards available to reduce future taxable income for state income tax purposes 
the state net operating loss carryforwards will expire  if not utilized  in the years through as of september   we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal and million for state income tax purposes individually available to reduce future income taxes 
the federal research credit carryforwards begin to expire in the year the california research credit can be carried forward indefinitely 
deferred tax liabilities have not been recognized for undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because it is management s intention to reinvest such undistributed earnings indefinitely in those foreign subsidiaries 
undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately million at september  if we distribute these earnings  in the form of dividends and otherwise  we would be subject to both us income taxes net of applicable foreign tax credits and withholding taxes payable to the foreign jurisdiction 
federal and state tax laws impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the event of an ownership change for tax purposes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
we have determined that the net operating losses and research and development credits acquired 
table of contents through the acquisition of two of our subsidiaries are subject to section limitations  and the effects of the limitations have been included in the loss and credit carryforwards 
if an ownership change occurs  in addition to the dates identified  the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards could be significantly reduced 
if we were to make additional repurchases of shares of our common stock  we could face additional limits on our use of net operating losses

cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments held at major banks  commercial paper  money market funds and other money market securities with original maturities of three months or less 
short term investments consist of investment grade corporate debt securities with moody s ratings of a or better 
as of september   approximately million of our cash and cash equivalents and investments was held in the united states 
the remainder of our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments was held outside of the united states in various foreign subsidiaries 
if these cash and cash equivalents and short term investments are distributed to the united states in the form of dividends or otherwise  we may be subject to additional us income taxes subject to an adjustment for foreign tax credits and foreign withholding taxes 
cash flows from operating activities we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  accounts receivable collections  and the timing and amount of tax and other payments 
our largest source of operating cash flow is cash collections from our customers for our services 
payments from customers for subscription services are generally collected in the beginning of the subscription period  ranging from one to twelve months or monthly during the life of the subscription period 
payments for our ratable licenses are generally collected by the delivery of the sigos site system 
payments from some of our customers are collected at the end of the monthly service period or as milestones are completed 
our primary use of cash from operating activities  are for personnel related expenditures  payment of insurance  regulatory compliance and other expenses for the operations of our business 

table of contents comparison of years ended september  and for the year ended september   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million which was primarily due to a net loss of million  adjusted for all non cash amortization  depreciation charges and stock based compensation 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was offset by cash used in operating activities due to an increase of approximately million in accounts receivable and decrease of approximately million in deferred revenue 
the increase in accounts receivable was mainly attributable to higher dso in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in deferred revenue is mainly attributable to increased number of itm customers that are now being billed on a month to month basis in arrears rather than being billed in advance 
comparison of years ended september  and for the year ended september   net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million which was primarily due to a net loss of million  adjusted for all non cash amortization  depreciation charges and stock based compensation 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses and a decrease in accounts receivable 
the increase in deferred revenue is primarily attributable to keynote sigos where of the cash is collected upon acceptance of the sigos site system  but revenue is being recognized over the maintenance period  which typically ranges from to months period 
the decrease in accounts receivable is due to improved collections as evidenced by our lower dso in fiscal as compared to fiscal cash flow from investing activities the changes in cash flows from investing activities primarily relate to acquisitions and the timing of purchases and maturities of investments 
we also use cash to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth and infrastructure 
comparison of years ended september  and cash flows from investing activities increased for the year ended september  compared to the prior year primarily due to the net sales of short term investments of million  offset by million of purchase of property and equipment  acquired technology  and the purchase of businesses and assets  net 
comparison of years ended september  and cash flows from investing activities decreased for the year ended september  compared to the prior year primarily due to the net purchases of short term investments  approximately million cash paid for the keynote sigos earnout  and to a lesser extent  approximately million of cash used for the payment of fixed assets 
cash flows from financing activities the changes in cash flows from financing activities primarily relate to payments made for stock repurchases and proceeds received from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan 
comparison of years ended september  and cash flows from financing activities decreased for the year ended september  compared to the prior year primarily due to repurchases of our common stock in fiscal as compared to fiscal we utilized approximately million and million to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market during the years ended september  and  respectively 
we received approximately million and million from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan for the years ended september  and  respectively 

table of contents comparison of years ended september  and cash flows from financing activities increased for the year ended september  compared to the prior year primarily due to modest repurchases of our common stock in fiscal as compared to fiscal in addition  the increase was attributable to higher proceeds received from the issuance of common stock associated with employees exercising stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
we utilized approximately million and million to repurchase shares of our common stock in the open market during the years ended september  and  respectively 
we received approximately million and million from the issuance of common stock associated with our employee stock option plan and employee stock purchase plan for the years ended september  and  respectively 
commitments and contractual obligations as of september   our principal commitments consisted of approximately million in real property and automobile operating leases and capital and equipment operating leases  with various lease terms  the longest of which expires in september additionally  we had contingent commitments ranging in length from one to thirty one months to bandwidth and co location providers amounting to approximately million in the aggregate for locations  which commitments become due if we terminate any of these agreements prior to their expiration 
at present  we do not intend to terminate any of these agreements prior to their expiration 
we expect to continue to invest in capital and other assets to support our growth 
the following table summarizes our minimum contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  in thousands payment due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations capital leases contractual obligations operating leases contingent commitments bandwidth and co location total the above amounts exclude liabilities under fin  as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement 
as of september   we have outstanding guarantees totaling  in one of our foreign subsidiaries  to customers and vendors as a form of security 
the guarantees can only be executed upon agreement by both the customer or vendor and us 
the guarantees are secured by a unsecured line of credit of  as of september  we generally do not indemnify customers for our measuring  monitoring and testing web based applications against legal claims that our products and services infringe on third party intellectual property rights 
other agreements entered into by us may include indemnification provisions that we could be subject to costs and or damages in the event of an infringement claim against us or an indemnified third party 
however  we have never been a party to an infringement claim and in the opinion of management  we do not have a liability related to any infringement claims subject to indemnification and as such  there is no material adverse affect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital  commitments and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
factors that could affect our cash position include potential acquisitions  additional stock repurchases  decreases in customers or renewals  decreases in revenue or changes in the value of our short term investments 
if  after some period of time  cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a credit facility 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  
table of contents these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the term of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders  and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain this additional financing  our future operating asset and liability balances  and our future working capital requirements may be impacted

to mitigate these risks we may use derivative financial instruments in accordance with our investment and foreign exchange policies 
we have not and currently do not use derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
our interest income and expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because most of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are invested in short term debt instruments 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by ten percent from levels at september   the interest earned on those cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments could increase or decrease by approximately  on an annualized basis
