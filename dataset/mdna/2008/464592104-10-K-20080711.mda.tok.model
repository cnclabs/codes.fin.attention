executive overview we are a leading developer  owner and operator of branded gaming facilities and related lodging and entertainment facilities in regional markets in the united states and internationally 
we have intentionally sought geographic diversity to limit the risks caused by weather  regional economic difficulties and local gaming authorities and regulations 
we currently operate casinos in mississippi  louisiana  missouri  iowa  colorado and florida 
internationally we operate casinos in coventry  dudley and wolverhampton  england and freeport  grand bahamas 
we also operate a harness racing track at our casino in florida 
our operating results have been affected by write offs and other valuation charges  the acquisition or opening of new properties  dispositions of properties  losses from the early extinguishment of debt  pre opening expenses and increases in competition 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with and giving consideration to the following write offs and other valuation charges as a result of continuing losses  a review of expected future operating trends and the current fair values or our long lived assets in england  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to long lived assets of our uk operations as of our fiscal year end 
the results from operations for the fiscal year also include million of charges related to the termination of our plans to develop a new casino in west harrison county  mississippi and the cancellation of construction projects in davenport  iowa and kansas city  missouri 
opening of new properties during fiscal year  our operating results were impacted by the opening of the slot gaming facility at our pompano park facility in april  the acquisition of our caruthersville  missouri casino in june and the opening of our waterloo  iowa and coventry  england casinos in june and july  respectively

pre opening expenses in fiscal year  we opened our new waterloo and coventry properties 
in late fiscal year we opened the slot gaming facility at our pompano park property 
for fiscal years and  we recorded pre opening expenses related to these properties in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
increased competition following the impact of hurricane katrina in the fall of  our mississippi properties in biloxi and natchez experienced strong revenue growth as a result of limited competition on the gulf coast 
since that time  the gulf coast has seen recovery in casino development which  combined with the closure of the biloxi ocean springs bridge through november   has significantly reduced our market share in biloxi from their artificially high post katrina levels 
patron counts have decreased at our natchez property as gaming patrons who were displaced by hurricanes have returned to the gulf coast 
in louisiana  our lake charles property experienced higher gaming revenues in fiscal year due to the closure of competitors facilities as a result of hurricane rita 
competition has reopened which has resulted in decreased gaming revenues at our lake charles property in fiscal year our quad cities bettendorf and davenport and marquette properties have experienced increased competition in many of their feeder markets  which has continued to have a negative impact on gaming revenues at these properties 
natchez flooding our natchez property was closed due to flooding for the last fourteen days of fiscal year impact of smoking restrictions our properties in black hawk have been negatively impacted by a smoking ban which went into effect on january  our quad cities properties have benefited from a similar smoking ban affecting competing casinos in illinois 
impact of the economy our properties are subject to the impact of general economic conditions 
increases in gasoline prices and other macro economic factors may impact the frequency of our customers visits and a decline in economic conditions in many of our markets may also affect our potential customers disposable income 
results of operations our results of operations for the fiscal years ended april   april  and april  reflect the consolidated operations of all of our subsidiaries and include the following properties lake charles  biloxi  lula  natchez  kansas city  boonville  caruthersville  bettendorf  marquette  waterloo  davenport  black hawk  colorado central station black hawk  our lucaya  blue chip dudley  blue chip wolverhampton  coventry  and pompano park 
fiscal years and results have been reclassified to reflect vicksburg and the bossier city which were sold on july   as discontinued operations 
our fiscal year ends on the last sunday in april 
this fiscal year convention creates more comparability of our quarterly operations  by generally having an equal number of weeks and weekend days in each quarter 
periodically  this convention necessitates a week year 
the fiscal years ended april  and april  were week years 
the fiscal year ended april  was a week year 
we believe that our historical results of operations may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of the substantial present and expected future increase in competition for gaming customers in each of our markets  as new gaming facilities open and existing gaming facilities expand or enhance their facilities 
we believe that our operating results may be materially affected by the economy and weather

availability of cash and additional capital at april   we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
as of april   we had million in revolving credit and million in term loans outstanding under the billion credit facility 
our net line of credit availability at april  was approximately million 
our july credit facility can be increased by million  subject to syndication and covenant flexibility  through additional borrowings greenshoe provisions 
exercise of the greenshoe provisions could result in resetting the credit facility interest rates to current market conditions 
the revolving loan commitment on the july credit facility is a variable rate instrument based on  at our option  libor or our lender s prime rate plus the applicable interest rate spread  and is effective through july the average rate on our outstanding borrowings under the july credit facility was approximately at april  from time to time we enter into various swap agreements to hedge against future interest rate increases 
as of april   we have outstanding swap agreements which have fixed libor before the applicable spread at a weighted average rate of for million of our debt with maturity dates ranging from to we are highly leveraged and our debt agreements contain covenants which may restrict our ability to borrow funds 
our july credit facility includes a number of affirmative and negative covenants  including certain financial covenants including maintenance of a leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio 
the july credit facility also restricts our ability to make certain investments or distributions 
the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes limits  among other things  our ability and our restricted subsidiaries ability to borrow money  make restricted payments  use assets as security in other transactions  enter into transactions with affiliates or pay dividends on or repurchase stock 
the indenture also limits our ability to issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries  sell assets in excess of specified amounts or merge with or into other companies 
while we believe that existing cash  cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our existing credit facilities will be sufficient to support our working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future  there is no assurance that these sources will in fact provide adequate funding for our planned capital expenditures 
as a result  limitations on our capital resources could delay or cause us to abandon certain plans for capital improvements at our existing properties and or development of new properties  which could place us at a competitive disadvantage 
if so we may need to access additional debt or equity financing which may not be available on acceptable terms 
we will continue to evaluate our planned capital expenditures at each of our existing locations in light of the operating performance of the facilities at such locations 
capital expenditures historically  we have made significant investments in property and equipment and expect that our operations will continue to demand ongoing investments to keep our properties competitive 
our current planned capital expenditures over the next to months are estimated as follows million in maintenance capital expenditures for fiscal year million to million to re brand our properties in davenport  lula  marquette and caruthersville as lady luck properties during fiscal year million for the rebuilding and refurbishment of our biloxi property which we plan to begin as soon as we determine the timing of the settlement of our hurricane katrina insurance claims and continued review of our credit availability 
this project is expected to extend into fiscal year the biloxi project is expected to include a new single level casino  restoration of our convention space  new food venues and renovation of the hotel rooms in the south tower 
additional capital expenditures for renovation of up to  additional hotel rooms are under design and cost review 
the timing and amount of our capital expenditures is subject to the availability of cash under our credit facility  the timing of additional insurance proceeds and cash flows from our continuing operations 
future development and other projects our primary focus for fiscal year and beyond is on organic growth opportunities at our existing properties  however  as part of our business development activities  from time to time we may enter into agreements which could result in the acquisition or development of businesses or assets 
our business development efforts and related agreements may require the expenditure of cash 
the amount and timing of our cash expenditures may vary based upon our evaluation of development opportunities 
our development plans are subject to a variety of factors including but not limited to obtaining permits  licenses and approvals from appropriate regulatory and other agencies  legislative changes and  in certain circumstances  negotiating acceptable leases 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles that require our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
management identifies critical accounting estimates as those that require the use of assumptions about matters that are inherently and highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made  those estimates where  had we chosen different estimates or assumptions  the resulting differences would have had a material impact on our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations  and those estimates that  if they were to change from period to period  likely would result in a material impact on our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
based upon management s discussion of the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  we believe the following accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
goodwill and other intangible assets at april   we had goodwill and other intangible assets of million  representing of total assets 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that may reduce the fair value of our goodwill and other intangible assets below their carrying value 
for properties with goodwill and or other intangible assets with indefinite lives  this test requires the comparison of the implied fair value of each property to carrying value 
the implied fair value includes estimates of future cash flows that are based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and represent our best estimates of the cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
changes in estimates or application of alternative assumptions and definitions could produce significantly different results 
during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  we engage an independent third party valuation firm to conduct annual impairment testing under sfas as a result of this annual impairment testing we recorded a million write down of goodwill at lula during fiscal year property and equipment at april   we had property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation of  million  representing of total assets 
we capitalize the cost of property and equipment 
maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as our current operating strategy 
future events such as property expansions  new competition  changes in technology and new regulations could result in a change in the manner in which we are using certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment using statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in assessing the recoverability of the carrying value of property  equipment and other long lived assets  we make assumptions regarding future cash flows and residual values 
if these estimates or the related assumptions are not achieved or change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets 
in evaluating impairment of long lived assets for newly opened operations  estimates of future cash flows and residual values may require some period of actual results to provide the basis for an opinion of future cash flows and residual values used in the determination of an impairment loss for these assets 
such an impairment loss would be recognized as a non cash component of operating income 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we engaged an independent third party valuation firm to conduct an appraisal of our long lived assets associated with our coventry  england due to the continuation of losses from operations  a review of expected future operating trends and the current fair values of our long lived assets in coventry 
based upon this appraisal  we recorded an impairment charge of million relating to the write down of long lived assets at our coventry  england operations as of the end of fiscal self insurance liabilities we are self funded up to a maximum amount per claim for our employee related health care benefits program  workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance 
claims in excess of this maximum are fully insured through a stop loss insurance policy 
we accrue a discounted estimate for workers compensation insurance and general liabilities based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
we rely on independent consultants to assist in the determination of estimated accruals 
while the estimated cost of claims incurred depends on future developments  such as increases in health care costs  in our opinion  recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments 
insurance accounting we have insurance coverage related to damage from three hurricanes for property damage incurred  property operating costs during the operational downtime of the hurricanes  incremental costs incurred related to hurricane damage and recovery activities and business interruption insurance for lost profits during the period directly related to the hurricanes 
the insurance claim is subject to the use of estimates and negotiations with our insurance carriers 
the total amount of impairments  losses recognized and expenses incurred have been recorded in our statement of operations as marketing and administrative and have been offset by the amount we believe is probable to be collected from our insurance carriers under our policy coverages 
we have received partial proceeds from our insurance carriers related to the losses we have sustained  and through april  have received advances of million 
at april  we have an insurance receivable relating to our hurricane claim of million and additional claims pending in excess of our receivable 
when we reach agreement with our insurance carriers on the final amount of the insurance proceeds we are entitled to  we will also record any related gain in excess of any remaining insurance receivable 
our insurance policies also provide coverage for the loss of profits caused by the storms 
any lost profit recoveries will be recognized when agreed to with our insurance carriers and will be reflected in the related properties revenues 
income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires that we recognize a current tax asset or liability for the estimated taxes payable or refundable based upon application of the enacted tax rates to taxable income in the current year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  including interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our senior secured credit facility july credit facility 
senior secured credit facilities during the fiscal year  we entered into six interest rate swap arrangements with an aggregate notional value of million as of april  the swap agreements effectively convert portions of the july credit facility variable debt to a fixed rate basis until the respective swap agreements terminate  which occurs during fiscal years   and these swap agreements meet the criteria for hedge accounting for cash flow hedges and have been evaluated  as of fiscal year  as being fully effective
