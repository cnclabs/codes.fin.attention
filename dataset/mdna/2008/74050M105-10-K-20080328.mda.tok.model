management s discussion and analysis december  forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that are provided to assist in the understanding of anticipated future financial performance 
however  such performance involves risks and uncertainties  and there are certain important factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
these important factors include  but are not limited to  economic conditions both generally and more specifically in the markets in which premier operates  competition for premier s customers from other providers of financial services  government legislation and regulation which changes from time to time  changes in interest rates  premier s ability to originate quality loans  collect delinquent loans and attract and retain deposits  the impact of premier s growth or lack thereof  premier s ability to control costs  and new accounting pronouncements  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of premier 
the words may  could  should  would  will  believe  anticipate  estimate  expect  intend  plan  project  predict  continue and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies general the financial condition and results of operations presented in the 
consolidated financial statements  accompanying 
notes to the consolidated financial statements and 
management s discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon our accounting policies 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below is a discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important to the presentation and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood

management s discussion and analysis december  allowance for loan losses the company monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the company maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of control over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan portfolio  and the loan grading system 
the company evaluates various loans individually for impairment as required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  such as loans on non accrual  loans past due days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management including loans graded as substandard or doubtful by the internal credit review process 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  with a group of loans that have similar characteristics 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  the company makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by sfas loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans is adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 
the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans is added together for a total estimate of probable incurred loan losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan losses of the company as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses exceeds the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses were below the range of reasonable estimates  the 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
the company recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is too high 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable incurred losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of goodwill as required by applicable accounting guidance  goodwill is evaluated at least annually to determine if the amount recorded on the company s balance sheet is impaired 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  the recorded amount would be reduced to estimated fair value by a charge to expense in the period in which impairment is determined 
impairment is evaluated in the aggregate for all of the company s banking operations 
operating characteristics of the aggregate banking operations are derived and compared to a database of peer group banks that have been sold 
pricing valuation factors that are considered in estimating the fair value of the company s aggregate banking operations include price to total assets  price to total book value  price to deposits and price to earnings 
unusual events that have impacted the operating characteristics of the company s aggregate banking operations are considered to assess the likelihood of recurrence and adjustments to historical performance may be made 
changes in assumptions regarding the likelihood of unusual historical events recurring or the use of different pricing valuation factors could have a material impact on management s impairment analysis

net income in was million 
the increase in over was the result of an increase in interest income due to a greater volume of loans outstanding  higher yields on all earning assets  a negative provision for loan losses  and a reduction in the net operating costs of the company 
net income in was a continuation of the company s improving profit trends primarily resulting from an increase in interest income due to higher yields on earning assets  a decrease in interest expense due to the early retirement of trust preferred securities  a significant decrease in the provision for loan losses  and a reduction in the net operating costs of the company when compared to the prior year 
basic earnings per share were in compared to in and to in the following table comparatively illustrates the components of roa and roe over the previous five years

the net loss in was primarily the result of an increase in the provision for loan losses  resulting in negative net credit income in in  net credit income was once again positive and continued to increase in both and again in in  minimal provisions for loan losses were recorded and thus there was little reduction from net interest income 
in  negative provisions for loan losses were recorded which served to increase net credit income to 
this increase in net credit income as a percent of average earning assets was complemented by an increase in non interest income as a percent of average earning assets and a reduction in non interest expenses as a percent of average earning assets when compared to the previous two years 
in  while net interest income continued to increase  net credit income was lower than as a result of minimal negative provisions for loan losses recorded in however  in  non interest income as a percent of average earning assets reached its highest level in the past five years while non interest expense as a percent of average earning assets reached its lowest level in the past five years 
as illustrated in the table  the result was to increase premier s return on average earning assets to and its return on average total assets to  each the highest performance ratio over the past five years

management s discussion and analysis december  in  average earning assets increased by or million from  following a or million decline in from average interest bearing liabilities  the primary source of funds supporting the earning assets  increased by only or million in from  which follows a or million decline in from the increase in average earnings assets was primarily the result of a million increase in average total loans and an million increase in average federal funds sold outstanding 
these increases more than offset the million decline in average total investment securities  as investment funds were used to fund loans and surplus investable proceeds were held in shorter term but higher yielding federal funds sold during the early part of the slight increase in average interest bearing liabilities was the result of a million increase in average interest bearing deposits and a million increase in average short term borrowings  primarily customer repurchase agreements  nearly completely offset by an million decrease in average high cost debt and federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
furthermore  the increase in average interest bearing deposits was complemented by a million increase in average non interest bearing deposits 
in  average earning assets declined  primarily as the result of a million decline in average total investment securities  as some maturing funds were used to fund loans or to continue the company s debt reduction strategy 
the decline in average interest bearing liabilities was due to a million decrease in average interest bearing deposits and a million decrease in average high cost debt and federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
a portion of the decline in average interest bearing deposits was due to the million increase in short term borrowings  primarily customer repurchase agreements 
furthermore  nearly all of the decrease in average interest bearing deposits was offset by a million increase in non interest bearing deposits 
additional information on each of the components of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is contained in the following sections of this report 
loan portfolio premier s loan portfolio is its largest and highest yielding component of average earning assets  totaling of average earning assets during average loans increased in by million or followed by a million or increase in the increase is largely attributable to loan growth in each of premier s markets 
in   premier realized a million or increase in average outstanding loans in its ohio markets  a million or increase in its kentucky markets and a million or increase in its west virginia markets 
this follows a million or increase in average loans its west virginia markets in  and a million or increase in loans in its ohio markets in in  average loans in premier s kentucky markets remained virtually unchanged 

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  total loans at december increased by million or from the total at december  this increase follows a million or increase in from total loans at december  this modest increase in is primarily the result of sluggish loan demand coupled with a higher level of loan payoffs  which offset  of loan charge offs recorded during the year 
the increase in was the result of a significant increase in loan demand in premier s markets which more than offset the million of loan charge offs recorded during the year 
loans secured by real estate  which in total constituted approximately of premier s loan portfolio at december   consist of a diverse portfolio of predominantly single family residential loans and loans for commercial purposes where real estate is part of the collateral  not the primary source of repayment 
residential real estate mortgage loans generally do not exceed of the value of the real property securing the loan at the time of origination 
the residential real estate mortgage loan portfolio primarily consists of adjustable rate residential mortgage loans 
the origination of these mortgage loans can be more difficult in a low interest rate environment where there is a significant demand for fixed rate mortgages 
premier also originates mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market and recognizes non interest income upon the sale of those mortgages in the form of commissions and servicing release fees 
premier has not engaged in the solicitation of so called sub prime or interest only mortgages 
premier uses third party underwriters to ensure the completeness of the borrowers loan application and documentation and to ensure that the loans meet the standards required by prospective loan purchasers 
additional information regarding the volume of mortgage loans originated and sold is contained in premier s consolidated statements of cash flows presented elsewhere in this annual report 
commercial loans are generally made to small to medium size businesses located within a defined market area and typically are secured by business assets and guarantees of the principal owners 
additional risks of loss are associated with commercial lending  such as the potential for adverse changes in economic conditions or the borrowers ability to successfully execute their business plan 
consumer loans generally are made to individuals living in premier s defined market area who are known to the local bank s staff 
consumer loans are generally made for terms of up to seven years on a secured or unsecured basis  however longer terms may be approved in certain circumstances and for revolving credit lines 
while consumer loans generally provide the company with increased interest income  consumer loans may involve a greater risk of default

management s discussion and analysis december  in addition to the loans presented in the loan summary table  premier also offers certain off balance sheet products such as letters of credit  revolving credit agreements  and other loan commitments 
these products are offered under the same credit standards as the loan portfolio and are included in the risk based capital ratios used by the federal reserve to evaluate capital adequacy

total non performing assets  which consist of past due loans on which interest is not being accrued non accrual loans  foreclosed properties in the process of liquidation oreo  loans with restructured terms to enable a delinquent borrower to repay and accruing loans past due days or more  were million or of total assets at year end the amount continues to decline from the million or of total assets at year end and the million or of total assets at year end the decrease in was largely due a million decrease in non accrual loans and a continued decrease in oreo property 
these decreases offset the increase in restructured loans  while loans past due days or more and still accruing remained virtually unchanged 
the decrease in was largely due to the million reduction in oreo property  which was partially offset by an increase in non accrual loans 
as the collection or rehabilitation of previously delinquent loans and charge offs of loans determined to be uncollectible continued in  these efforts were offset by other loans newly placed on non accrual status 
in  the level of non accrual loans declined primarily as a result of loan payoffs as well as partial or complete loan charge offs 
management believes the estimated potential losses related to delinquent loans to be adequately provided for in the allowance for loan losses 
these losses were also included in the analyses that supported the recording of negative loan loss provisions during and the second quarter of the decrease in non performing assets in was due to the collection or rehabilitation of previously delinquent loans  the charge offs of loans determined to be uncollectible and the sale of million of oreo property 
as management s efforts to collect these loans upon maturity continue  loans are only renewed using premier s strengthened credit policies 
otherwise  loans may be placed on non accrual status and foreclosure proceedings begun to obtain and liquidate any collateral securing the past due or matured loans 
premier is committed to continuing to reduce its level of non performing assets and maintaining strong underwriting standards to help maintain a lower level of non performing assets in the future 
this effort is revealed in the decline in non performing assets from the end of to the end of  primarily related to the sale of oreo properties and the decline in non accrual loans and loans days past due 
premier s efforts at its other affiliate banks in and were masked by the high level of non performing assets at farmers deposit bank  which alone totaled million at december  at december   the non performing assets at farmers deposit bank had declined to million  leaving million of total non performing assets at the other affiliate banks combined 
by december   total non performing assets at farmers deposit bank had declined to million 

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  the loan summary table presents five years of comparative non performing asset information 
other than these loans and the impaired loans discussed in 
note to the consolidated financial statements  premier does not have a significant volume of loans where management has serious doubts about the borrowers ability to comply with the present repayment terms of the loan 
it is premier s policy to place loans that are past due over days on non accrual status  unless the loans are adequately secured and in the process of collection 
premier had no commitments to provide additional funds on non accrual loans at december  for real estate loans  upon repossession  the balance of the loan is transferred to other real estate owned oreo and carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance or the fair value of the property based on current appraisals and other current market trends  less estimated disposal costs 
if a writedown of the oreo property is necessary at the time of foreclosure  the amount is charged against the allowance for loan losses 
a periodic review of the recorded property value is performed in conjunction with normal loan reviews  and if market conditions indicate that the recorded value exceeds the fair market value less estimated disposal costs  additional writedowns of the property value are charged directly to operations 
during premier recognized a  net profit on the disposition of oreo properties  net of writedowns  while in premier realized  net profit on the disposition of oreo properties 
during  premier realized a  net profit on the disposition of oreo properties 
although loans may be classified as non performing  some continue to pay interest irregularly or at less than originally contracted terms 
during  approximately  of interest was recognized on non accrual and restructured loans  while approximately  would have been recognized in accordance with their original terms 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable incurred losses associated with lending activities 
actual losses are charged against the allowance charge offs while collections on loans previously charged off recoveries are added back to the allowance 
since actual losses within a given loan portfolio are difficult to predict  management uses a significant amount of estimation and judgment to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include an individual assessment of risk on certain loans and total creditor relationships  historical charge off experience  the type of loan  levels of non performing and past due loans  and an evaluation of current economic conditions 
loans are evaluated for credit risk and assigned a risk grade 
premier s risk grading criteria are based upon federal reserve guidelines and definitions 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  loans that are assigned passing grades are grouped together and multiplied by historical charge off percentages to determine an estimated amount of potential losses and a corresponding amount of allowance 
loans that are assigned marginally passing grades are grouped together and allocated slightly higher percentages to determine the estimated amount of potential losses due to the identification of increased risk s 
loans that are assigned a grade of substandard or doubtful are usually determined to be impaired 

table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  a loan is categorized and reported as impaired when it is probable that the borrower will be unable to pay all of the principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
in determining whether a loan is impaired  management considers such factors as past payment history  recent economic events  current and projected financial conditions and other relevant information that is available at the time 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage  consumer  and credit card loans  and on an individual basis for other loans 
if a loan is deemed to be impaired  an evaluation of the amount of estimated loss is performed assessing the present value of estimated future cashflows using the loan s existing rate or assessing the fair and realizable value of the loan collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
the estimation of loss is assigned to the impaired loan and is used in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
for impaired loans  this estimation of loss is reevaluated quarterly and  if necessary  adjusted based upon the current known facts and circumstances related to the loan and the borrower 
additional information on premier s impaired loans is contained in 
note to the consolidated financial statements 
the sum of the calculations and estimations of the risk of loss in a given loan portfolio is compared to the recorded balance of the allowance for loan losses 
if the total allowance is deemed to be inadequate a charge to earnings is recorded to increase the allowance 
conversely  should an evaluation of the allowance result in a lower estimate of the risk of loss in the loan portfolio and the allowance is deemed to be more than adequate  a reversal of previous charges to earnings a negative provision may be warranted in the current period 
events that may lead to negative provisions include greater than anticipated recoveries  a reduction in the historical loss ratios  securing more collateral on an impaired loan during the collection process  or receiving payment in full on an impaired loan 
all of these events occurred in varying degrees during and and resulted in  of negative provisions during and  of negative provisions during at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total year end loans 
this ratio is a decrease from the prior year s and the at the end of the decrease in the allowance in was primarily the result of the  of negative provisions for loan losses coupled with  of net charge offs recorded during the year 
the decrease in the allowance in was primarily the result of the million of negative provisions for loan losses recorded during the year  as charge offs in were nearly offset by recoveries 
the decrease in was the result of the charge off of million of loans previously identified as impaired partially offset by  of recoveries 
only  of provision expense was recorded in in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb the current estimated risk of loss in the existing loan portfolio 
the summary of the allowance for loan losses allocated by loan type is presented in the loan summary table above 
the following table provides a detailed history of the allowance for loan losses  illustrating charge offs and recoveries by loan type  and the annual provision for loan losses over the past five years 
in  a negative provision was recorded during the second quarter which exceeded the quarterly provisions recorded during the other three quarters of the year 
in  negative provisions were recorded in each of the four quarters of the year 
the negative 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  provisions were recorded primarily as result of realized collections of previously impaired loans whereby estimated losses were previously assigned to the loan 
in addition  premier has been successful in recovering some of its previously charged off loans 
these positive events as well as the ongoing reduction in premier s historical loss ratios resulted in a lower estimate of the risk of loss in the loan portfolio and  thus  negative provisions were warranted

management s discussion and analysis december  future provisions to the allowance for loan losses  positive or negative  will depend on future improvement or deterioration in estimated credit risk in the loan portfolio as well as whether additional payments are received on loans having significant credit risk 
the provision for loan losses in was only  during the third and fourth quarters of  negative provisions were recorded substantially offsetting the provisions recorded during the first half of the year 
during the latter half of  premier realized collections of previously impaired loans for which estimated losses had been previously assigned to the loan  as well as recoveries of previously charged off loans 
premier continually evaluates the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses  and changes in the provision are based on the estimated probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
net charge offs in totaled  as  of loans charged off were nearly offset by  of recoveries of loans previously charged off 
net charge offs in decreased to just  as  of recoveries nearly offset  of charge offs recorded during the year 
in comparison  net charge offs in totaled million 
in  farmers deposit bank recorded  of net recoveries and provided over of the company s total recoveries for in  farmers deposit bank recorded  of net recoveries and provided nearly of the company s total recoveries for these recoveries are primarily the result of continued collection efforts of the significant number and amount of loans charged off at farmers deposit bank in through approximately  or of the net charge offs and million  or of the premier s net charge offs were at farmers deposit bank 
the level of future recoveries is likely to decrease as the level of past charge offs has decreased 
over the past three years  total charge offs have continued to decline 
in  charge offs on consumer installment loans increased by  or 
however  the increase was more than offset by decreases in the level of charge offs of commercial loans and loans secured by real estate 
while total charge offs decreased in  the level of loans secured by real estate that were charged off increased by  or as collection efforts on a few real estate secured borrowers came to their ultimate conclusion 
all categories of loan charge offs were down in  while consumer loan charge offs continued to exceed the other categories of loan charge offs 
although management believes it has identified the significant remaining credit risk in the loan portfolio  additional charge offs may be recorded in the coming months due to the level of non performing loans and the resolution of collection efforts on those loans 
premier continues to make a significant effort to reduce its past due and non performing loans by reviewing loan files  using the courts to bring borrowers current with the terms of their loan agreements and or the foreclosure and sale of oreo properties 
as in the past  when these plans are executed  premier may experience increases in non performing loans and non performing assets 
furthermore  any resulting increases in loans placed on non accrual status will have a negative impact on future loan interest income 
also  as these plans are executed  other loans may be identified that would necessitate additional charge offs and potentially 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  additional provisions for loan losses 
premier continues to monitor and evaluate the impact that national housing market price declines may have on its local markets and collateral valuations as management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
while some price deterioration is expected  it is not currently anticipated that premier s markets will be impacted as severely as other areas of the country due to the historically modest increases in real estate values in the company s markets 
these factors are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which at december  was of total loans outstanding and of non performing loans

management s discussion and analysis december  investment portfolio and other earning assets investment securities averaged million in  down million or from the million averaged in this decrease follows a million or decrease in from the million averaged in as investments matured in and  not all funds were reinvested in the investment portfolio 
some funds were used to satisfy loan growth  deposit withdrawals and debt payments 
furthermore  during the latter part of and first half of  bond reinvestment yields were not as attractive as the yield on highly liquid federal funds sold and funds from maturing investments were less likely to be reinvested in bonds 
at december   the amount of investments totaled million  up million from december  this follows a million decrease in from the balance at december  as the federal reserve board has lowered the federal funds rate in the latter portion of  bond yields have become more attractive than the yield on federal funds sold 
thus  to optimize interest income  premier has begun increasing the amount of funds it has invested in high quality debt securities

management s discussion and analysis december  premier s average investment in federal funds sold and other short term investments increased by in this follows a increase in averaging million in  federal funds sold and other short term investments increased million from the million averaged in the increase in average federal funds sold in was the result of retaining available funds to be used in the short term to fund loans and satisfy deposit withdrawals 
furthermore  during the latter part of and first part of  bond yields were not as attractive as the yield on highly liquid federal funds sold and funds from maturing investments were less likely to be invested in bonds 
as shown in the consolidated average balance sheets and net interest income analysis above  on average  federal funds sold yielded in and in in each year  this yield was higher than the yield earned on us treasury and agency securities as well as mortgage backed securities 
the increase in average federal funds sold in was  likewise  the result of retaining available funds to be used in the short term to fund loans or satisfy deposit withdrawals 
fluctuations in federal funds sold and other short term investments reflect management s goal to maximize asset yields while maintaining proper asset liability structure  as discussed in greater detail above and in other sections of this report

market rates continued to increase through as a result  the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased to in  up from the paid in  and the paid in the basis point increase in was primarily the result of a basis point increase in the average rate paid on certificates of deposit and other time deposits  which made up of the total average interest bearing liabilities in during  premier was able to offset some of the increase in rates paid on deposits by long term debt refinancing actions taken in and prepaying approximately million of amortizing fhlb advances in the first quarter of in  premier refinanced the remaining million of its trust preferred securities with variable rate bank borrowings as discussed in more detail below

due to alternative sources of investment and an ever increasing sophistication of customers in funds management techniques to maximize return on their money  competition for funds has become more intense 
premier s banks periodically offer special rate products to attract additional deposits 
premier s deposits  on average  increased by million or in following a  or decrease in from average deposits 
the increase in average deposits was from a combination of a million increase in average certificates of deposit

management s discussion and analysis december  and other time deposits plus a million increase in non interest bearing deposits 
these increases more than offset a million decrease in average now and money market deposits 
during  as rates paid on certificates of deposits increased  particularly short term certificates of deposit  customers reallocated their funds from lower yielding transactional deposits such as now and money market accounts to these short term certificates of deposit 
premier s deposits  on average  remained relatively unchanged in  decreasing by  or from average deposits

in  average non interest bearing deposits continued to increase  surpassing average non interest bearing deposits by million or 
this follows a million  or increase in average non interest bearing deposits in when compared to since no interest is paid on these deposits  an increase in non interest bearing deposits helps to increase premier s net interest margin and its profitability 
non interest bearing deposits are more susceptible to withdrawal and therefore may provide challenges to maintaining adequate liquidity 
see the additional discussion on liquidity below 
however  premier s approach to community banking and friendly customer service has resulted in increases in average non interest bearing deposits in each of the past five years 
in  average interest bearing deposits increased by million or 
the increase was primarily from an increase in average certificates of deposit and other time deposits as customers sought out higher yielding short term special rates 
while offering some special certificate of deposit rates  in premier continued to focus on building its base of customer relationships by offering more convenient electronic banking products to its non interest bearing deposit customers 
premier did realize a shift in its interest bearing deposits from lower cost interest bearing transaction accounts to certificates of deposit as customers moved their funds to take advantage of the rising interest rates paid on these certificates 
the result was a basis point increase in the average rate paid on interest bearing deposits in however  premier also realized an increase in its average savings deposits in in  average interest bearing deposits decreased by million or 
this decrease 
table of contents premier financial bancorp  inc 
management s discussion and analysis december  was largely due to the stiff competition for funds in and high rate certificate of deposits specials offered by some of premier s local competition 
some of these special rates exceeded the yields that premier could earn by purchasing investments and therefore matching the competition s rates would have resulted in reducing premier s net interest income 
similar to  in premier realized a shift in its interest bearing deposits from lower cost savings and interest bearing transaction accounts to certificates of deposit as customers moved their funds to take advantage of the rising interest rates paid on these certificates

these short term borrowings fluctuate depending on near term funding needs and as part of premier s management of its asset liability mix

asset liability management and market risk asset liability management is a means of maximizing net interest income while minimizing interest rate risk by planning and controlling the mix and maturities of interest related assets and liabilities 
premier has established an asset liability management committee alco for the purpose of monitoring and managing interest rate risk and to evaluate investment portfolio strategies 
interest rate risk is the earnings variation that could occur due to changes in market interest rates 
the board of directors has established policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
premier monitors its interest rate risk through the use of an earnings simulation model developed by an independent third party to analyze net interest income sensitivity 
the earnings simulation model uses assumptions  maturity patterns  and reinvestment rates provided by premier and forecasts the effect of instantaneous movements in interest rates of both and basis points 
the most recent earnings simulation model projects that net interest income would increase by approximately over the projected stable rate net interest income if interest rates rise by basis points over the next year 
conversely  the simulation projects an approximate decrease in net interest income if interest rates fall by basis points over the next year 
within the same time frame  but assuming a basis point movement in interest rates  the simulation projects that net interest income would increase by over the projected stable rate net interest income in a rising rate scenario and would decrease by in a falling rate scenario 
under both the and basis point simulations  the percentage changes in net interest income are within premier s alco guidelines 
the model simulation calculations of present value have certain acceptable shortcomings 
the discount rates and prepayment assumptions utilized are based on estimated market interest rate levels for similar loans and securities nationwide 
the unique characteristics of premier s loans and securities may not necessarily parallel those assumed in the model simulations  and therefore  actual results could likely result in different discount rates  prepayment experiences and present values 
the discount rates used for deposits and borrowings are based upon available alternative types and sources of funds which may not necessarily be indicative of the present value of premier s deposits and borrowings 
premier s deposits have customer relationship advantages that are difficult to simulate 
a higher or lower interest rate environment will most likely result in different investment and borrowing strategies by premier which would be designed to further mitigate any negative effects on the value of  and the net interest earnings generated on premier s net assets

base rate liquidity liquidity is the ability to satisfy demands for deposit withdrawals  lending commitments  and other corporate needs 
premier s liquidity is based on the stable nature of consumer core deposits held by the banking subsidiaries 
likewise  additional liquidity is available from holdings of investment securities and short term investments which can be readily converted into cash 
furthermore  premier s banks continue to have the ability to attract short term sources of funds such as federal funds and repurchase agreements 
premier generated million of cash from operations in  which compares to million in and million in the increase in was primarily the result of an increase in net income  a decrease in negative provisions for loan losses and cash received from the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market 
the increase in over was the result of a return to normal cash generated from operations compared to the low level in was primarily the result of the payment of the deferred distributions of the trust preferred securities in march  which came out of cash from operations 
total cash from operations along with proceeds from the sale and maturity of securities and the repayment of loans were used to purchase securities  satisfy deposit withdrawals  fund new loans and reduce outstanding debt during those years 
net cash provided by liquidating investing activities totaled million in however in  million of cash was used in investing activities primarily to fund loan growth and in million of cash was used in investing activities  again to fund loan growth but to also increase federal funds sold 
in addition to the million of cash from operations in  premier generated million in additional cash from financing activities  primarily due to the increase in deposits 
the increase in cash from deposits was also used to satisfy the repayment of fhlb advances and other borrowed funds as well as pay dividends to shareholders 
in  premier generated million in additional cash from financing activities  primarily due to increases in deposits and repurchase agreements

capital resources premier s consolidated average equity to asset ratio increased to during  up from in and in the ratios for all three years are considered adequate for a company of premier s size 
the increase in was largely due to the increase in net income  plus a general rise in the market value of investments from an overall unrealized loss at the end of to an overall unrealized gain at the end of the increase in was largely due to the increase in net income with the slight decline in average total assets 
the federal reserve s risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratio measure the capital adequacy of banking institutions 
the risk based capital guidelines weight balance sheet assets and off balance sheet commitments by prescribed factors relative to credit risk  thus eliminating disincentives for holding low risk assets and requiring more capital for holding higher risk assets 
at year end  premier s risk adjusted capital to assets ratio was compared to at december  both of these ratios are well above the minimum level of prescribed for bank holding companies of premier s size 
the leverage ratio is a measure of total tangible equity to total tangible assets 
premier s leverage ratio at december  was compared to at december  both of these ratios are above the recommended to recommended by the federal reserve 
the increase in the ratios was primarily the result of the net income recorded in  partially offset by dividends paid to shareholders 
the net result was an increase in shareholders equity 
premier s capital ratios are the direct result of management s desire to maintain a strong capital position

management s discussion and analysis december  income statement analysis net interest income net interest income  the amount by which interest generated from earning assets exceeds the expense associated with funding those assets  is premier s most significant component of earnings 
net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis was million in  up from the million earned in which follows a increase in from when net interest income is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis  interest income from tax exempt earning assets is increased by the amount equivalent to the federal income taxes which would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutory federal tax rate of for companies of premier s size 
the increase in net interest income in is largely due to an increase in interest income from loans  investments and federal funds sold partially offset by an increase in interest expense on deposits 
the increase in interest income on loans and investments was largely the result of increases in yields while the increase in interest income from federal funds sold and a portion of the increase in loan interest income was the result of a higher average volume of those assets 
the increase in interest expense on deposits was largely due to an increase in the rates paid on deposits 
however  a higher average volume of certificates of deposit also contributed to the increase in interest expense 
as shown in the rate volume analysis table below  increases in the yields on loans  investments  and other earnings assets increased premier s interest income by million in this increase was complemented by a  increase in interest income due to the higher volume of average loans outstanding and a  increase in interest income due to the higher volume of average federal funds sold outstanding in interest income was decreased by  however  due to a lower volume of average investment securities outstanding 
also shown in the table below  interest expense on deposits increased by million  million due to higher rates paid  primarily on certificates of deposit  and million due to a higher volume of average certificates of deposit 
also increasing interest expense was the higher average volume of short term and other borrowings 
this interest expense increase was more than offset  however  by the decrease in average fhlb borrowings and the repayment of the trust preferred securities in late the increase in net interest income in is largely due to an increase in interest income from loans  investments and federal funds sold due to higher overall yields and a greater volume of loans outstanding

this overall increase in interest expense was partially offset by net interest expense savings of  due to the refinancing and early redemption of outstanding debt and the reduction in fhlb borrowings 
some of this interest expense savings was offset by higher interest paid on other short term borrowings

the rates paid on other borrowings increased as premier refinanced its subordinated debt with floating prime rate and below prime rate loans in resulting in significant interest expense savings 
the rates paid on fhlb advances increased as a result of the prepayment of certain amortizing advances at one affiliate bank while leaving higher rate fixed maturity advances at another bank 
the overall result of increasing rates paid on deposits and rate decreases resulting from debt refinancing was to increase the overall cost of funds by basis points to  up from in and in as a result  premier s net interest spread decreased by basis points

management s discussion and analysis december  effects of changing prices the results of operations and financial condition presented in this report are based on historical cost  unadjusted for the effects of inflation 
inflation affects premier in two ways 
one effect is that inflation can result in increased operating costs which must be absorbed or recovered through increased prices for services 
the second effect is on the purchasing power of the corporation 
virtually all of a bank s assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
regardless of changes in prices  most assets and liabilities of the banking subsidiaries will be converted into a fixed number of dollars 
non earning assets  such as premises and equipment  do not comprise a major portion of premier s assets  therefore  most assets are subject to repricing on a more frequent basis than in other industries 
premier s ability to offset the effects of inflation and potential reductions in future purchasing power depends primarily on its ability to maintain capital levels by adjusting prices for its services and to improve net interest income by maintaining an effective asset liability mix 
management s efforts to meet these goals are described in other sections of this report 
summary results of operations fourth quarter net income for the three months ended december  totaled  a  or increase from the  of net income reported for the fourth quarter of on a per share basis  premier s net income for the fourth quarter of was cents per share  compared to cents per share for the same quarter last year 
net interest income totaled  for the fourth quarter of  an increase of  or from the net interest income earned in the same quarter of the increase is the result of higher interest income on loans and investments due to higher yields and an increase in interest income on loans and federal funds sold due to an increase in their average balance 
this increase in interest income was partially offset by an increase in interest expense 
an increase in interest expense on deposits as a result of higher rates paid was partially reduced by a decrease in interest expense on borrowings due to lower outstanding balances and lower borrowing rates due to the refinancing of the subordinated debt 
during the fourth quarter of  premier recorded a  provision for loan losses 
this compares to the reversal of  of previously recorded provisions for loan losses negative provisions in the fourth quarter of the negative provisions were the result of continued improvement in the estimated credit risk at banks formerly subject to regulatory agreements and payments on loans previously identified as having significant credit risk at farmers deposit bank 
future provisions to the allowance for loan losses  positive or negative  will depend on future improvement or deterioration in estimated credit risk in the loan portfolio as well as whether additional payments are received on loans having significant credit risk
