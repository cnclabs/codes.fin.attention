effective june   we became the exclusive  global licensee for the sale  manufacture  distribution and marketing of the liz claiborne fragrance brands under a long term license agreement with liz claiborne  inc and certain of its affiliates 
the liz claiborne fragrance portfolio consists of the juicy couture  curve by liz claiborne  lucky  liz  realities  bora bora and mambo fragrances 
in connection with the liz claiborne license agreement we also assumed a license for the usher celebrity fragrances 
we anticipate that the liz claiborne licensing arrangement will allow us to i increase our market share in our north america fragrance segment  ii gain efficiencies from a larger fragrance business  particularly by leveraging our supply chain  logistics and sales organizations  iii increase our gross margins by converting existing north america mass customer sales from distribution margins to owned licensed margins  and iv provide additional sales volume for our international segment

table of contents in fiscal  we incurred expenses related to the liz claiborne transaction of million  before taxes 
in addition  in connection with this license we discontinued certain brands and products resulting in a product discontinuation charge of million  before taxes 
during fiscal  we expect to incur transition expenses relating to the liz claiborne licensing agreement of approximately to million  primarily during the quarter ending september  in addition  we anticipate that our gross margins for the first half of fiscal will be impacted by expenses relating to liz claiborne inventory that we purchased at a higher cost prior to the effective date of the license agreement 
we expect this charge to be approximately million  before taxes  of which million is expected to be recorded during the quarter ending september  in fiscal  we commenced a comprehensive review of our global business processes to re engineer our extended supply chain  logistics and transaction processing systems 
we call this initiative our global efficiency re engineering initiative 
in may  we announced that we had decided to accelerate the re engineering of our extended supply chain functions as well as the realignment of other parts of our organization to better support our new business processes 
in connection with our global efficiency re engineering initiative  we are also migrating to an oracle financial accounting and order processing system to improve key transaction processes and accommodate anticipated growth of our business 
we expect this infrastructure investment to simplify our transaction processing by utilizing a common platform to centralize all of our global transaction processing functions 
as a result of the acceleration of the re engineering of our extended supply chain functions and the implementation of the oracle financial accounting and order processing system  we are implementing a restructuring plan that will result in restructuring and one time expenses  including severance  relocation  recruiting and temporary staffing expenditures 
we expect these expenses to be incurred primarily in fiscal years and and currently estimate that they will total million to million before taxes  of which million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in those consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other factors that we believe are most likely to occur 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates  which are recorded in the period in which they become known 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
if these changes result in a material impact to the consolidated financial statements  their impact is disclosed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and or in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the disclosures below also note situations in which it is reasonably likely that future financial results could be affected by changes in these estimates and assumptions 
the term reasonably likely refers to an occurrence that is more than remote but less than probable in the judgment of management 
our most critical accounting policies and estimates are described in detail below 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements general information and summary of significant accounting policies  for a discussion of these and other accounting polices 
accounting for acquisitions and intangible assets 
we have accounted for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
under the purchase method of accounting  the costs  including transaction costs  are allocated to the underlying net assets  based on their respective estimated fair values 
the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
logo 
table of contents the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value and expected useful lives assigned to each class of assets and liabilities acquired can significantly affect net income 
for example  different classes of assets will have useful lives that differ  and the useful life of property  plant  and equipment acquired will differ substantially from the useful life of brand licenses and trademarks 
consequently  to the extent a longer lived asset is ascribed greater value under the purchase method than a shorter lived asset net income in a given period may be higher 
determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities acquired is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
one of the areas that requires more judgment is determining the fair value and useful lives of intangible assets 
in this process  we often obtain the assistance of third party valuation firms for certain intangible assets 
our intangible assets consist of exclusive brand licenses  trademarks and other intellectual property  customer relationships and lists  non compete agreements and goodwill 
the value of these assets is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
we review indefinite lived intangible assets and goodwill for impairment at least annually 
all of our intangibles are reviewed for impairment or reconsideration of the useful life assigned as circumstances dictate using the guidance of applicable accounting literature 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
factors used to estimate the fair value and useful life of intangible assets include historical and expected future revenues and profitability and the discounted future cash flows related to the asset 
because the fair value and estimated useful life of an intangible asset is a subjective estimate  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
for example  if we discontinue or experience a decline in the profitability of one or more of our brands  the value of the intangible assets associated with those brands or their useful lives may decline  or  certain intangible assets  such as the elizabeth arden brand trademarks  may no longer be classified as an indefinite lived asset  which could result in additional charges to net income 
we have determined that the elizabeth arden trademarks have indefinite useful lives  as cash flows from the use of the trademarks are expected to be generated indefinitely 
during the quarter ended june   we performed our annual impairment testing of these assets with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
the analyses and assessments of these assets and our goodwill indicated that no impairment adjustments were required 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization is provided over the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight line method 
periodically  we review the lives assigned to our long lived assets and adjust the lives  as circumstances dictate 
because estimated useful life is a subjective estimate  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
for example  if we experience significant declines in net sales in certain channels of distribution  it could affect the estimated useful life of certain of our long lived assets  such as counters or trade fixtures  which could result in additional charges to net income 
long lived assets 
we review for the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
because the fair value is a subjective estimate  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
the same circumstances that could affect the estimated useful life of a long lived asset  as discussed above  could cause us to change our estimate of the fair value of that asset  which could result in additional charges to net income 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
logo 
table of contents revenue recognition 
sales are recognized when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility of the resulting receivable is probable 
sales are recorded net of estimated returns  markdowns and other allowances 
the provision for sales returns and markdowns represents management s estimate of future returns and markdowns based on historical experience and considering current external factors and market conditions 
allowances for sales returns and markdowns 
as is customary in the prestige beauty business  we grant certain of our customers  subject to our authorization and approval  the right to either return product or to receive a markdown allowance 
upon sale  we record a provision for product returns and markdowns estimated based on our historical and projected experience  economic trends and changes in customer demand 
because there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the allowance for returns and markdowns  it is reasonably likely that actual experience will differ from our estimates 
if  for example  customer demand for our products is lower than estimated  additional provisions for returns or markdowns may be required resulting in a charge to income in the period in which the determination was made 
as a percentage of gross sales  our expense for returns and markdowns was  and for the fiscal years ending june   and  respectively 
a hypothetical change in the value of our allowance for sales returns and markdowns as of june  would result in a million change to net income 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover uncollectible accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including an analysis of receivables aging and a customer by customer review for large accounts 
it is reasonably likely that actual experience will differ from our estimates  which may result in an increase or decrease in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if  for example  the financial condition of our customers deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required  resulting in a charge to income in the period in which the determination was made 
a hypothetical change in the value of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable as of june  would result in a million change to net income 
provisions for inventory obsolescence 
we record a provision for estimated obsolescence and shrinkage of inventory 
our estimates consider the cost of inventory  forecasted demand  the estimated market value  the shelf life of the inventory and our historical experience 
because of the subjective nature of this estimate  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
if  for example  demand for our products declines or if we decide to discontinue certain products  we may need to increase our provision for inventory obsolescence which would result in additional charges to net income 
a hypothetical change in the value of our provision for inventory obsolescence as of june  would result in a million change to net income 
hedge contracts 
we have designated each qualifying foreign currency contract we have entered into as a cash flow hedge 
unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  associated with these contracts are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the balance sheet 
gains and losses will only be recognized in earnings in the period in which the contracts expire 
share based compensation 
all share based payments to employees  including the grants of employee stock options  are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values  but only to the extent that vesting is considered probable 
compensation cost for awards that vest will not be reversed if the awards expire without being exercised 
the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of the market based restricted stock awards is determined using a monte carlo simulation model  and the fair value of all other restricted stock awards is based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation costs for awards are amortized using the straight line method 
option pricing model input assumptions such as expected term  expected volatility and risk free interest rate impact the fair value estimate 
further  the forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation 
these assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
logo 
table of contents when estimating fair value  some of the assumptions are based on or determined from external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with share based arrangements 
the appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment  based on relevant facts and circumstances 
we rely on our historical experience and post vested termination activity to provide data for estimating our expected term for use in determining the fair value of our stock options 
we currently estimate our stock volatility by considering our historical stock volatility experience and other key factors 
the risk free interest rate is the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term used as the input to the black scholes model 
we estimate forfeitures using our historical experience 
our estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from their estimates 
because of the significant amount of judgment used in these calculations  it is reasonably likely that circumstances may cause the estimate to change 
if  for example  actual forfeitures are lower than our estimate  additional charges to net income may be required 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing a potential valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged or credited to net income in the period in which such determination was made 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  we recognize in our consolidated financial statements the impact of a tax position if it is more likely than not that such position will be sustained on audit based on its technical merits 
while we believe that our assessments of whether our tax positions are more likely than not to be sustained are reasonable  each assessment is subjective and requires the use of significant judgments 
as a result  one or more of such assessments may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could result in a change to net income

seasonality our operations have historically been seasonal  with higher sales generally occurring in the first half of the fiscal year as a result of increased demand by retailers in anticipation of and during the holiday season

we have a revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks  for which jpmorgan chase bank is the administrative agent  which generally provides for borrowings on a revolving basis 
in order to accommodate the increased working capital requirements associated with the growth of our business  on july   the credit facility was amended to increase its size from million to million  with a million sub limit for letters of credit

at our option  the applicable margin may be applied to either the london interbank offered rate libor or the prime rate 
the reference ratio for determining the applicable margin is a debt service coverage ratio 
the applicable margin charged on libor loans ranges from to and is for prime rate loans  except that the applicable margin on the first million of borrowings from august to october of each year  while the temporary increase in our borrowing base is in effect  is higher

the indentures also provide that the holders of the senior subordinated notes have the option to require us to repurchase their notes in the event of a change of control involving us as defined in the indentures 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to cover debt service  working capital requirements and capital expenditures for the next twelve months  other than additional working capital requirements that may result from further expansion of our operations through acquisitions of additional brands  new product launches or distribution arrangements
