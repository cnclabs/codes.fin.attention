item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a clinical laboratory located in northeastern new jersey 
our regional footprint lies within the new york city metropolitan area and the surrounding areas of new jersey and southern new york state as well eastern pennsylvania and some areas of western connecticut  under certain circumstances  we provide services further into new york state  pennsylvania  delaware and maryland 
as a regional provider  we are a full service laboratory that primarily services physician office practices  our drivers pick up samples and deliver reports and supplies  we provide sophisticated technical support  phlebotomy services or patient service centers where appropriate  and electronic communication services in many cases 
we have also developed a national reputation for our expertise in certain focused areas of clinical testing 
genpath  our cancer and oncology laboratory  is one of the premier hematopathology laboratories in the country 
physicians outside of our regional footprint send samples to our laboratory in order to take advantage of the expertise that we are able to provide in blood based cancer pathology and associated diagnostics 
our correctional healthcare services are used throughout the country at prisons and jails 
the focused markets we serve on a national basis outside of our regional footprint do not require many of the logistical and other ancillary support services required within the region 
even within our regional footprint  we provide the same services that we provide on a national basis as well as some regional focused diagnostic services  such as histology and pathology support services  substance abuse testing  fertility testing  hemostasis testing  women s health testing  and molecular diagnostics that are unavailable from many of the smaller regional competitors  testing in some of these areas may be provided outside of physician offices 
over the last few years  there have been fundamental changes in the laboratory services industry 
in the s  the industry was negatively impacted by the growth of managed care  increased government regulation  and investigations into fraud and abuse 
these factors led to revenue and profit declines and industry consolidations  especially among commercial laboratories 
there are currently only three publicly traded full service laboratories operating in the us while that means that the two national mega laboratories and bioreference laboratories are the only remaining publicly traded commercial laboratories  there are numerous hospital outreach programs and smaller reference laboratories that compete for the commercial clinical laboratory business scattered throughout the country 
clinical laboratories have had to improve efficiency  leverage economies of scale  comply with government regulations and other laws and develop more profitable approaches to pricing 
moreover  there has been a proliferation of technology advancements in clinical diagnostics over the last decade that has created significant opportunities for new testing and growth 
as a full service clinical laboratory  we are constantly looking for new technologies and new methodologies that will help us to grow 
since the turn of the century  our size alone has made us attractive to companies that are driving the advances in technology 
we represent a significant opportunity for these companies to market their products in one of the major population centers of the world the new york metropolitan area 
we have had several successful strategic relationships with such technology opportunities 
in addition to new technology opportunities  we have an extremely seasoned and talented management staff that has been able to identify emerging laboratory markets that are under served or under utilized 
we are currently developing programs for cardiology  histology and women s health to go along with our existing hemostasis  hematopathology and correctional healthcare initiatives which have already been established and in which we have been increasing our market share for the past several years 
we will continue to vigilantly seek focused diagnostic marketing opportunities where we can provide information  technology  service or support that expand and grow our clinical laboratory 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company acquired the operating assets of genedx  a leading dna sequencing laboratory 
as molecular testing in general becomes a more significant element in the diagnostic testing industry  the company believes that genetic testing will become an essential diagnostic tool of the future 
genedx was started by two geneticists from the nih in over the next six years  based on the reputation and expertise of the founders and the outstanding team they built around themselves  along with a very focused and dedicated understanding of the science of genetics  genedx became known as one of the premier genetic testing laboratories for the diagnosis of rare genetic diseases 
the company believed that the promise of genetic testing is in the diagnosis of the genetic variants of common diseases 
it is the company s intention to leverage the expertise and reputation of genedx in order to take a leadership role in the expanding area of genetic testing 
the company is seeking cutting edge methods of testing that will be commercially viable diagnostic tools for the advancement of genetic testing 
during the past year  genedx introduced genomedx  a new test based on cgh array technology  a high speed  chip based technology  that has allowed genedx to move to the forefront of an emerging technology platform 
the company is already expanding the menu of tests offered and employing marketing techniques that were extremely successful in building genpath  our oncology laboratory 
in addition to scientists and technicians to manage testing  genedx employs several genetic counselors to help patients and referring physicians and geneticists understand the meaning of the test results 
prior to the acquisition  genedx s revenues and profits were increasing at an accelerating rate 
this increase has continued through fiscal while we recognize that we are a clinical laboratory that processes samples  we also understand that we are an information company that needs to effectively communicate the results of our efforts back to healthcare providers 
laboratory results play a major role in the implementation of physician healthcare 
laboratory results are used to diagnose  monitor and classify health concerns 
in many cases  laboratory results represent the confirming data in diagnosing complicated health issues 
since laboratory results play such an important role in routine physician care  we have developed informatics solutions that leverage our role in healthcare 
we needed to build a web based solution to quickly  accurately  conveniently and competitively collect ordering information and deliver results  so we built an internal solution that we call careevolve 
that solution has been essential to our own operations 
we license the technology to other laboratories throughout the country which they utilize to more effectively compete against the national laboratories 
these other laboratories licensing our technology are not out competitors since they are outside our regional footprint 
we have also created our psimedica business unit which has developed a clinical knowledge management ckm system that takes data from enrollment  claims  pharmacy  laboratory results and any other available electronic source to provide both administrative and clinical analysis of a population 
the system uses proprietary algorithms to cleanse and configure the data and transfer the resulting information into a healthcare data repository 
using advanced cube technology methodologies  the data can be analyzed from a myriad of views and from highly granular transactional detail to global trended overview 
events such as the katrina disaster in louisiana two summers ago and general pressures from the government have made development of an electronic medical record system and pay for performance reimbursement priority goals in the healthcare industry 
a large portion of an individual s medical record consists of laboratory data and a key performance indicator in any pay for performance initiative is laboratory result data 
our ckm system is a mature  full functioning solution that will allow us to play a role in these important national initiatives 
to date  neither our psimedica business unit nor careevolve has produced significant revenues 
results of operations in thousands  except per patient data fiscal year compared to net revenues net revenues for the year ended october  were  as compared to  for the year ended october   this represents an increase in net revenues 
this increase is due to an increase in patients serviced and a increase in net revenue per patient 
our laboratory operations had net revenues of  in fiscal the number of patients serviced during the year ended october  was  which was greater when compared to the prior fiscal year 
net revenue per patient for the year ended october  was compared to net revenue per patient for the year ended october  of  an increase of  or as a result of increases in esoteric testing 
cost of services cost of services for the year ended october  was  as compared to  for the year ended october   an increase of 
this increase is related to the increase in net revenues of 
however  reagent  laboratory and medical supplies increased at a year over year rate of reflecting a significant increase in the more expensive tests that we offer from payers who reimburse at lower rates than our traditional business trends 
this is in a large part the result of changes in managed care contracts in the new york metropolitan area that enabled the company to grow substantially in revenues 
gross profit gross profit on net revenues increased to  for the year ended october  from  for the year ended october   an increase of   primarily attributable to the increase in net revenues 
gross profit margins remained constant at since both revenues and expenses increased

this increase is related to the increase in net revenues of 
interest expense interest expense increased from  during the year ended october  to  during the year ended october   an increase of this increase is due to increased utilization of our line of credit  the acquisition of our genetics laboratory and capital lease acquisitions 
management believes that this trend may continue in the future due to the continued use of our revolving line of credit to fund our growth 
net income we realized net income of  for the twelve month period ended october  as compared to  for the twelve month period ended october   an increase of 
pre tax income for the period ended october  was  as compared to  for the period ended october   an increase of  and was caused primarily by a decrease in expenses in relation to an increase in net revenues 
the provision for income taxes increased from  for the period ended october   to  for the current twelve month period

marketing expenses as a percent of net revenues decreased from in the period ended october  to in the period ended october  interest expense interest expense increased from  during the year ended october  to  during the year ended october   an increase of this increase is due to an increase in the variable interest rates associated with and the increased utilization of our line of credit 
management believes that this trend may continue in the future due to the continued use of our revolving line of credit to fund our growth and the increase in interest rates that may continue to occur during fiscal year net income we realized net income of  for the twelve month period ended october  as compared to  for the twelve month period ended october   an increase of 
pre tax income for the period ended october  was  as compared to  for the period ended october   an increase of  and was caused primarily by a decrease in expenses in relation to an increase in net revenues

liquidity and capital resources in thousands except for the million term loan and its repayment terms for the fiscal year ended october  our working capital at october  was approximately  as compared to approximately  at october   an increase of  our cash position increased by approximately  during the current period 
we increased our short term borrowing by approximately  and repaid approximately  in existing debt 
we had current liabilities of approximately  at october  we generated approximately  in cash from operations  an increase of approximately as compared to the year ended october  accounts receivable  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  totaled approximately  at october   an increase of approximately  from october   or 
this increase was primarily attributable to increased revenue 
cash collected over the twelve month period ended october  increased over the prior twelve month period 
net service revenues on the statements of operations are as follows years ended october gross revenues contr 
adjustments and discounts net revenues percent of contractual adjustments and discounts to gross revenues the table above illustrates the relationship between contractual adjustments and gross revenues for the fiscal years   and between and  contractual adjustments increased approximately basis points 
the most significant factor in this increase was the increase in market share caused by the acquisition of contracts with low reimbursement third party payors 
credit risk with respect to accounts receivable is generally diversified due to the large number of patients comprising our client base 
we have significant receivable balances with government payors and various insurance carriers 
generally  we do not require collateral or other security to support customer receivables 
however  we continually monitor and evaluate our client acceptance and collection procedures to minimize potential credit risks associated with our accounts receivable and to establish an allowance for uncollectible accounts 
as a consequence  we believe that our accounts receivable credit risk exposure beyond such allowance is not material to the financial statements 
a number of proposals for legislation continue to be under discussion which could substantially reduce medicare and medicaid reimbursements to clinical laboratories 
depending upon the nature of regulatory action  and the content of legislation  we could experience a significant decrease in revenues from medicare and medicaid  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are unable to predict  however  the extent to which such actions will be taken

billing comm 
ins total billing for laboratory services is complicated and we must bill various payors  such as the individual  the insurance company  the government federal or state  the private company or the health clinic 
other factors that may complicate billing include differences between fee schedules and reimbursement rates 
incomplete or inaccurate billing information as provided by the doctor 
disparity in coverage and information requirements 
disputes with payors 
internal and external compliance policies and procedures 
significant costs are incurred as a result of our participation in government programs since billing and reimbursement for laboratory tests are subject to complex regulations 
we perform the requested tests and report the results whether the information is correct or not or even missing 
this adds to the complexity and slows the collection process and increases the aging of our accounts receivable a r 
when patient invoices are not collected in a timely manner the item is written off to the allowance 
days sales outstanding dso for fiscal years and were and  respectively  a decrease of approximately 
these changes are exaggerated by our primary marketplace  the physician office marketplace 
however  when you compare our dso lag to our collectible net revenues as reported on our financial statements for the periods in question  it varies between to  depending on the period 
overall  the components of a r as shown above for the two years under review have not varied much year over year 
the percent of a r over days has decreased to as of october  as compared to as of october  in october  the company entered into an amended revolving note payable loan agreement with a bank 
the maximum amount of the credit line available to the company is the lesser of i  or ii of the company s qualified accounts receivable 
as defined in the agreement 
the amendment to the loan and security agreement provides for interest on advances to be subject to the bank s prime rate or eurodollar rate of interest plus  in certain instances  an additional interest percentage 
the additional interest percentage charges on eurodollar borrowings range from to and are determined based upon certain financial ratios achieved by the company 
at october   the company had elected to have  of the total advances outstanding converted into a eurodollar rate loan with a variable interest rate of at october  the remaining outstanding advances during that period were subject to the bank s prime rate of interest

the credit line is collateralized by substantially all of the company s assets 
the line of credit is available through october and may be extended for annual periods by mutual consent  thereafter 
the terms of this agreement contain  among other provisions  requirements for maintaining defined levels of capital expenditures  fixed charge coverage  insurance coverage and the prohibition of the payment by the company of cash dividends

new authoritative pronouncements in june fasb issued interpretation no 
fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
this statement is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september fasb issued sfas no 
employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
this statement mandates certain changes in financial reporting for companies with defined benefit pension plans 
since this company does not currently maintain a defined benefit pension plan this statement is not currently expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in february fasb issued fas the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
the statement is effective as of the beginning of each reporting entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement  which is consistent with the board s long term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments 
most of the provisions of this statement apply only to entities that elect the fair value option 
however  the amendment to fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities 
this statement is not currently expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in december fasb issued fas r business combinations and fas noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements these statements are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years in case of fas  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
together these statements revise the accounting rules with respect to accounting for business combinations 
specifically  the objective of fas r is to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness and comparability of the information that the reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
this statement thus establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the objective of fas is to improve the relevance  comparability  and transparency of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its consolidated financial statements by establishing accounting and reporting standards that require the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified  labeled  and presented in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity  but separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income 
changes in a parent s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling financial interest in its subsidiary be accounted for consistently 
a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary changes if the parent purchases additional ownership interests in its subsidiary or if the parent sells some of its ownership interests in its subsidiary 
it also changes if the subsidiary reacquires some of its ownership interests or the subsidiary issues additional ownership interests 
all of those transactions are economically similar  and this statement requires that they be accounted for similarly  as equity transactions 
when a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained noncontrolling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value 
the gain or loss on the deconsolidation of the subsidiary is measured using the fair value of any noncontrolling equity investment rather than the carrying amount of that retained investment 
entities provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
together these statements are not currently expected to have a significant impact on the entity consolidated financial statements 
a significant impact may however be realized on any future acquisition s by this company 
the amounts of such impact can not be currently determined and will depend on the nature and terms of such future acquisition s  if any 
also  in november and december sec issued two staff accounting bulletins sab and sab respectively 
sab expresses the views of the staff regarding written loan commitments that are accounted for at fair value through earnings under generally accepted accounting principles 
sab expresses the views of the staff regarding the use of a simplified method  as discussed in sab no 
sab  in developing an estimate of expected term of plain vanilla share options in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised 
together these sabs are not expected to have a significant impact on the entity consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
accounting for goodwill we evaluate the recoverability and measure the possible impairment of goodwill under sfas  the impairment test is a two step process that begins with the estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit 
the first step screens for potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
management s estimate of fair value considers publicly available information regarding our market capitalization as well as i publicly available information regarding comparable publicly traded companies in the clinical laboratory testing industry  ii the financial projections and future prospects of our business  including its growth opportunities and likely operational improvements  and iii comparable sales prices  if available 
as part of the first step to assess potential impairment  management compares the estimate of fair value to book value on a consolidated net assets basis 
if the book value of the consolidated net assets is greater than the estimate of fair value  we then proceed to the second step to measure the impairment  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying value the implied fair value is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill is greater than its implied fair value  an impairment loss will be recognized in that period 
accounting for intangible and other long lived assets we evaluate the possible impairment of our long lived assets  including intangible assets 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
evaluation of possible impairment is based on our ability to recover the asset from the expected future pretax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations 
if the expected undiscounted pretax cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying amount of the asset 
accounting for revenue service revenues are principally generated from laboratory testing services including chemical diagnostic tests such as blood analysis  urine analysis and genetic testing among others 
net service revenues are recognized at the time the testing services are performed and are reported at their estimated net realizable amounts 
these estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered  are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the related services are rendered and adjusted in subsequent periods based upon an analysis of the company s collection experience from each category of payor group as well as prospectively determined contractual adjustments and discounts with third party payors 
differences between these adjustments and any subsequent revisions are included in the statement of operations in which the revisions are made and are disclosed  if material 
applying this methodology and aggregating its collection experience from all payor groups  the company has not been required to record an adjustment related to revenue recorded in prior periods that was material in nature 
accounting for contractual credits and doubtful accounts an allowance for contractual credits and discounts is estimated by payor group and determined based upon a review of the reimbursement policies and subsequent collections from the different types of payors 
the company has not been required to record an adjustment in a subsequent period related to revenue recorded in a prior period  that was material in nature 
accounting for employment benefit plan the company sponsors a k profit sharing plan 
the plan 
employees become eligible for participation after attaining the age of eighteen and completing one year of service 
participants may elect to contribute up to ten percent of their compensation  as defined in the plan adoption agreement  to a maximum allowed by the internal revenue service 
the company may choose to make a matching contribution to the plan for each participant who has elected to make tax deferred contributions for the plan year  at a percentage determined each year by the company 
the company elected to make a matching contribution which amounted to  for   for and  for the employer contribution will be fully vested after the third year of service 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method 
under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains historical information as well as forward looking statements 
statements looking forward in time are included in this annual report pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results in future periods to be materially different from any future performance suggested herein 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while many aspects of our business are subject to complex federal  state and local regulations  the accounting for our business is generally straightforward 
our revenues are primarily comprised of a high volume of relatively low dollar transactions  and about of all our costs consist of employee compensation and benefits 
revenues are recognized at the time the services are performed and are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others for services rendered including prospectively determined adjustments under reimbursement agreements with third party payors 
these adjustments are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the services are rendered and adjusted in future periods as final settlements are determined 
these estimates are reviewed and adjusted  if warranted  by senior management on a monthly basis 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are correct  however  several factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors in addition to those discussed under risk factors as well as elsewhere herein including our failure to integrate newly acquired businesses if any and the costs related to such integration 
our failure to obtain and retain new customers and alliance partners  or a reduction in tests ordered or specimens submitted by existing customers 
adverse results from investigations of clinical laboratories by the government  which may include significant monetary damages and or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
loss or suspension of a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under  or future changes in  the law or regulations of clia  or those of medicare  medicaid or other federal  state or local agencies 
changes in federal  state  local and third party payor regulations or policies or in the interpretation of current regulations affecting governmental and third party reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing such as the decrease in medicare reimbursement for flow cytometry testing at the beginning of calendar year described above under cautionary statements 
failure to comply with the federal occupational safety and health administration requirements and the recently passed needlestick safety and prevention act 
failure to comply with hipaa  which could result in significant fines as well as substantial criminal penalties 
changes in payor mix 
failure to maintain our days sales outstanding levels 
increased competition  including price competition 
our ability to attract and retain experienced and qualified personnel 
adverse litigation results 
liabilities that result from our inability to comply with new corporate governance requirements 
failure to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not invest in or trade market risk sensitive instruments 
we also do not have any foreign operations or foreign sales so that our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk is non existent 
we do have exposure to both rising and falling interest rates 
at october   advances of approximately  under our loan agreement with pnc bank were subject to interest charges at the bank s then prime rate of 
in addition  we elected to have the remaining  of advances outstanding at said date converted into a eurodollar rate loan with a variable interest rate of 
we estimate that our monthly cash interest expense at october  was approximately  and that a one percentage point increase or decrease in short term rates would increase or decrease our monthly interest expense by approximately  see note to the consolidated financial statements contained herein
