item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following md a contains various forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these forward looking statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events  including the following statements regarding future developments and joint ventures  rents  returns  and earnings  statements regarding the continuation of trends  and any statements regarding the sufficiency of our cash balances and cash generated from operating and financing activities for our future liquidity and capital resource needs 
we caution that although forward looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs and best judgment based upon current information  these statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including those risks  uncertainties  and factors detailed from time to time in reports filed with the sec  and in particular those set forth under risk factors of this annual report on form k 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements of taubman centers  inc and the notes thereto 
general background and performance measurement taubman centers  inc tco is a michigan corporation that operates as a self administered and self managed real estate investment trust reit 
the taubman realty group limited partnership the operating partnership or trg is a majority owned partnership subsidiary of tco  which owns direct or indirect interests in all of our real estate properties 
in this report  the terms we  us and our refer to tco  the operating partnership and or the operating partnership s subsidiaries as the context may require 
we own  develop  acquire  dispose of  and operate regional and super regional shopping centers 
the consolidated businesses consist of shopping centers that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreements  development projects for future regional shopping centers  variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary  the taubman company llc manager  and taubman properties asia llc and its subsidiaries taubman asia 
shopping centers owned through joint ventures that are not controlled by us but over which we have significant influence unconsolidated joint ventures are accounted for under the equity method 
references in this discussion to beneficial interest refer to our ownership or pro rata share of the item being discussed 
also  the operations of the shopping centers are often best understood by measuring their performance as a whole  without regard to our ownership interest 
consequently  in addition to the discussion of the operations of the consolidated businesses  the operations of the unconsolidated joint ventures are presented and discussed as a whole 
the comparability of information used in measuring performance is affected by the opening of partridge creek in october  the expansion and renovation at waterside in  and the pier shops  which began opening in phases in june additional comparable center statistics that exclude partridge creek  waterside  and the pier shops are provided for and to present the performance of comparable centers in our continuing operations 
the pier shops was excluded from all operating statistics in comparable centers are generally defined as centers that were owned and open for two years 
as of january   we began consolidating the entity that owns cherry creek 
the center is included within our consolidated results and statistics as of that date  while it continues to be presented as an unconsolidated joint venture for dates and periods prior to january  in april  we increased our ownership in the pier shops to see results of operations openings  expansions and renovations  acquisitions  and disposition 
the pier shops results of operations are included within the consolidated businesses beginning april  and within the unconsolidated joint ventures prior to the acquisition date 
the results of operations for the unconsolidated joint ventures include results of the pier shops 
our investment in the pier shops represented an effective interest prior to the acquisition date  based on relative equity contributions 
overall summary of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our primary source of revenue is from the leasing of space in our shopping centers 
generally these leases are long term  with our average lease term at approximately eight years 
therefore general economic trends most directly impact our tenants sales and consequently their ability to perform under their existing lease agreements and expand into new locations as well as our ability to find new tenants for our shopping centers 
occupancy continued to increase during  and we anticipate continued occupancy growth in  although we expect occupancy to be flat to modestly down in the first half of  with a slight increase in the second half of tenant sales increased in and reached a new record level of per square foot for our comparable centers 
see mall tenant sales and center revenues and rental rates and occupancy 
the rents we are able to achieve are similarly affected by economic trends and tenants expectations thereof  as described under rental rates and occupancy 
average rent per square foot increased by in and we anticipate rent per square foot to increase in the range of about in excluding prior year adjustments relating to the mills corporation s accounting for lease incentives recorded in at arizona mills  a owned unconsolidated joint venture  average rent per square foot increased by in the spread between rents on openings and closings may not be indicative of future periods  as this statistic is not computed on comparable tenant spaces  and can vary significantly from quarter to quarter depending on the total amount  location  and average size of tenant space opening and closing in the period 
mall tenant sales  occupancy levels and our resulting revenues are seasonal in nature see seasonality 
our analysis of our financial results begins under results of operations 
we have been active in developing and expanding our shopping center portfolio  and we describe the most recent center openings  including partridge creek  the pier shops  and northlake mall northlake  under results of operations openings  expansions and renovations  acquisitions  and disposition 
in  we acquired an additional interest in the pier shops  and in  a owned unconsolidated joint venture disposed of its interest in a center 
additional efforts to broaden our growth included the formation in of taubman asia  which is the platform for our expansion into the asia pacific region 
in  we completed agreements to provide management  leasing  and development services for a project in songdo  incheon  south korea 
in early  we completed agreements to acquire a minority position in a project in macao  china and to provide development  leasing  and management services for the project see results of operations taubman asia and results of operations subsequent events 
see also results of operations third party management  leasing  and development services for other development and service arrangements 
we similarly have been very active in managing our balance sheet  completing financings related to an increase in our revolving line of credit and the refinancing of the pier shops  as well as a series of stock repurchases  as outlined under results of operations debt transactions and results of operations equity transactions 
in january  we completed a refinancing at international plaza see results of operations subsequent events 
we have certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues  recoveries from tenants  and revenue from management  leasing  and development services 
we disclose our share of these sources of income under results of operations other income 
included in other revenue are lease cancellation income  as well as other sources of revenue derived from our shopping centers  such as parking garage and sponsorship income 
other sources of income include interest income  gains on peripheral land sales  and in  gains related to discontinued hedges see also results of operations debt transactions 
we then provide a discussion of our critical accounting policies  the impact of adoption of accounting principles in  and the expected impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements 
with all the preceding information as background  we then provide insight and explanations for variances in our financial results for   and under comparison of to and comparison of to 
as information useful to understanding our results  we have described the presentation of our minority interest  the presentation of certain interests in centers  and the reasons for our use of non gaap measures such as ebitda and funds from operations ffo under results of operations presentation of operating results 
reconciliations from net income and net income allocable to common shareowners to these measures follow the annual comparisons 
our discussion of sources and uses of capital resources under liquidity and capital resources begins with a brief overview of capital activities and transactions occurring in analysis of specific operating  investing  and financing activities is then provided in more detail 
cash flows from rents and recoveries  lease cancellation revenue  and recent center openings provide the resources for payments of interest and other operating expenses  leasing costs  and required distributions and dividends 
specific analysis of our fixed and floating rates and periods of interest rate risk exposure is provided under liquidity and capital resources beneficial interest in debt 
completing our analysis of our exposure to rates are the effects of changes in interest rates on our cash flows and fair values of debt contained under liquidity and capital resources sensitivity analysis 
in conducting our business  we enter into various contractual obligations  including those for debt  capital leases for property improvements  operating leases for land and office space  purchase obligations  and other long term commitments 
detail of these obligations  including expected settlement periods  is contained under liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations 
property level debt represents the largest single class of obligations 
described under liquidity and capital resources loan commitments and guarantees and liquidity and capital resources cash tender agreement are our significant guarantees and commitments 
development of new malls and renovation and expansion of existing malls continues to be a significant use of our capital  as described in liquidity and capital resources capital spending and liquidity and capital resources planned capital spending 
recent spending includes that related to the construction of partridge creek and the pier shops  the expansion and renovation of twelve oaks  the expansion at stamford  our oyster bay project in the town of oyster bay  new york oyster bay project or oyster bay  and other development activities and capital items 
additional capital spending in is expected to continue for certain of these and other projects 
dividends and distributions are also significant uses of our capital resources 
the factors considered when determining the amount of our dividends  including requirements arising because of our status as a reit  are described under liquidity and capital resources dividends 
we increased our quarterly dividend by in the fourth quarter of our common stock has now provided a nearly compound annual return over the past years  the best return of any us reit 
mall tenant sales and center revenues tenant sales continued to grow in  increasing and reaching a new record level of per square foot 
however  growth in sales per square foot was only in the fourth quarter and flat in december  the most important month of the year for sales 
over the long term  the level of mall tenant sales is the single most important determinant of revenues of the shopping centers because mall tenants provide approximately of these revenues and because mall tenant sales determine the amount of rent  percentage rent  and recoverable expenses together  total occupancy costs that mall tenants can afford to pay 
however  levels of mall tenant sales can be considerably more volatile in the short run than total occupancy costs 
we believe that the ability of tenants to pay occupancy costs and earn profits over long periods of time increases as sales per square foot increase  whether through inflation or real growth in customer spending 
because most mall tenants have certain fixed expenses  the occupancy costs that they can afford to pay and still be profitable are a higher percentage of sales at higher sales per square foot 
sales directly impact the amount of percentage rents certain tenants and anchors pay 
the effects of increases or declines in sales on our operations are moderated by the relatively minor share that percentage rents represent of total rents approximately five percent in 
however  a sustained trend in sales does impact  either negatively or positively  our ability to lease vacancies and negotiate rents at advantageous rates 
the following table summarizes occupancy costs  excluding utilities  for mall tenants as a percentage of mall tenant sales mall tenant sales in thousands of dollars sales per square foot consolidated businesses minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales unconsolidated joint ventures minimum rents percentage rents expense recoveries mall tenant occupancy costs as a percentage of mall tenant sales sales per square foot is presented for the comparable centers  including value centers 
rental rates and occupancy as leases have expired in the shopping centers  we have generally been able to rent the available space  either to the existing tenant or a new tenant  at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases 
in a period of increasing sales  rents on new leases will tend to rise as tenants expectations of future growth become more optimistic 
in periods of slower growth or declining sales  rents on new leases will grow more slowly or may decline for the opposite reason 
however  center revenues nevertheless increase as older leases roll over or are terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that are usually higher than the average rates for existing leases

mall tenant leased space  ending occupancy  and average occupancy rates are as follows all centers leased space ending occupancy average occupancy comparable centers leased space ending occupancy average occupancy for our comparable centers  ending occupancy was  a increase from in we anticipate continued occupancy growth in  although we expect occupancy to be flat to modestly down in the first half of  with a slight increase in the second half of income from temporary in line tenants  which has become an integral part of our business  continues to augment our income 
temporary tenants  defined as those with lease terms less than months  are not included in occupancy or leased space statistics 
as of december   approximately of space was occupied by temporary tenants 
tenant bankruptcy filings as a percentage of the total number of tenant leases remains low at in  compared to in  and in seasonality the regional shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the christmas season  and with lesser  though still significant  sales fluctuations associated with the easter holiday and back to school events 
while minimum rents and recoveries are generally not subject to seasonal factors  most leases are scheduled to expire in the first quarter  and the majority of new stores open in the second half of the year in anticipation of the christmas selling season 
additionally  most percentage rents are recorded in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  revenues and occupancy levels are generally highest in the fourth quarter

see below 
the pier shops  located in atlantic city  new jersey  began opening in phases in june gordon developed the center  and in january  we assumed full management and leasing responsibility for the center 
in april  we increased our ownership in the pier shops to a controlling interest 
the remaining interest continues to be held by an affiliate of gordon 
we began consolidating the pier shops as of the april purchase date 
at closing  we made a million equity investment in the center  bringing our total equity investment to million 
we are entitled to a cumulative preferred return on our million total investment  including our million share of debt see debt transactions 
we will be responsible for any additional capital requirements  estimated to be in the range of million over the next two years  on which we will receive a preferred return at a minimum of 
the pier shops had a negative impact of million on our earnings in  excluding an additional million of depreciation and amortization 
while sales at the center continue to be good  the timing of final lease up is at a slower pace than we previously anticipated 
a major factor is the lease up of the few remaining large spaces on the third and fourth levels of the center which are intended to be restaurants  night clubs  and entertainment uses 
consequently  the growth in net operating income that we anticipated for will likely be delayed at least a year 
we continue to believe as the asset stabilizes we will see significant growth in net operating income 
in december  a owned unconsolidated joint venture sold its interest in woodland for million 
our share of proceeds was million 
we recognized a gain of million on the transaction  representing the excess of the fair value over the net book basis of our interest in the center 
our gain on the transaction differed from the million gain recognized by the operating partnership due to our million additional basis in woodland 
taubman asia established in  taubman asia is the platform for our expansion into the asia pacific region 
taubman asia is headquartered in hong kong and is engaged in projects that leverage our strong retail planning  design and operational capabilities 
in  we entered into an agreement to provide development services for a million square foot retail and entertainment complex in songdo  incheon  south korea 
we also finalized an agreement to provide management and leasing services for the retail component 
the shopping complex is expected to open in fall  with construction beginning in the middle of we have negotiated the opportunity to invest  at our option  in a portion of the broader project  which will include not only retail but other uses 
we anticipate finalizing our decision on this investment in the first half of in february  we announced that taubman asia is acquiring a interest in the mall at studio city  the retail component of macao studio city  a major mixed use project currently under construction on the cotai strip in macao  china 
in addition  taubman asia entered into long term agreements to perform development  management and leasing services for the shopping center 
see subsequent events regarding our expected investment and return on this project 
third party management  leasing  and development services in addition to the services described in taubman asia  we have several projects that are expected to contribute significant amounts of third party revenue to our results in the future 
we are finalizing an agreement to provide initial leasing services for a lifestyle center in the city of north las vegas  nevada 
this is a mixed use project that will include retail  dining  and entertainment of up to million square feet and a residential component consisting of approximately units 
the shopping center is now expected to open in the developer of the residential component is a joint venture that includes an affiliate of the taubman family 
the taubman family affiliate also participates in the project s non residential component 
we are also finalizing a development agreement regarding city creek center  a mixed use project in salt lake city  utah 
demolition of the existing structures began in november and the project is now expected to open in late we are also finalizing agreements to be an investor in this project under a capital lease structure 
see liquidity and capital resources planned capital spending regarding this center and other projects 
in addition  we currently have an agreement for retail leasing and development and design advisory services for mgm citycenter  a mixed use urban development project scheduled to open in on the strip in las vegas  nevada 
the term of this fixed fee contract is approximately years  effective june  and is generally cancelable for cause and by the project owner upon payment to us of a cancellation fee 
we also have a management agreement for woodfield mall  which is owned by a third party 
this contract is renewable year to year and is cancelable by the owner with days written notice 
subject to many assumptions  our best estimate is that during the to timeframe  and possibly into depending on opening dates  we will earn in the range of million to million of net margin from management  leasing  and development fees 
net margin for these projects means total revenue less related expenses and taxes 
the timing of revenue recognition is very difficult to predict due to a number of factors 
for development  revenue is recognized when the work is performed 
for leasing  it is recognized when the leases are signed or when stores open  depending on the agreement 
of the million to million  we expect this third party margin will likely peak in when the level of activity is expected to be the greatest 
although this activity is highly profitable  it is very volatile and a substantial portion of this increased activity represents non recurring income 
once the significant development and initial leasing effort is complete for these projects  fees will be much more modest 
as we have discussed in the past  we would generally prefer to own as much equity in a project as possible 
however  each of these projects met a series of criteria including profitability and synergy with our ongoing activities that made it attractive for us to pursue 
we would expect that some level of this activity will always be present in our business 
debt transactions we completed a series of debt financings in the three year period ended december   as follows date initial loan balance facility stated interest rate maturity date in millions of dollars trg revolving credit facility november libor february the pier shops at caesars april may taubman land associates sunvalley december libor november waterside shops at pelican bay september october the mall at partridge creek construction facility september libor september trg revolving credit facility august libor february cherry creek shopping center may june northlake mall february february the mall at short hills december december the mall at wellington green may may excludes any options to extend the maturities see the footnotes to our financial statements regarding extension options

the loan is swapped at swap rate plus credit spread from january  through the term of the loan 
see liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations 
trg revolving credit facility was amended in november in  we entered into three forward starting swaps for million to partially hedge interest rate risk associated with a planned long term refinancing of international plaza in january we terminated the swaps in september  as they were no longer effective as hedges of the planned refinancing  and recognized our million share of the million gain on the termination  included in gains on land sales  interest income  and other within results of operations 
we paid off the remaining million balance on the loans on the shops at willow bend willow bend when they became prepayable without penalty in february we wrote off the remaining million of financing costs associated with the willow bend loans at that time 
proceeds from the august amendment to our revolving credit facility were used to refinance the remaining million balance on the loan on dolphin when it became prepayable without penalty in august we wrote off million of financing costs related to the dolphin loan at that time 
under the revised terms  borrowings under the line of credit are primary obligations of the entities owning dolphin  fairlane  and twelve oaks  which are collateral for the line of credit 
the operating partnership and the entities owning fairlane and twelve oaks are guarantors under the credit agreement 
proceeds from the december financing on the mall at short hills short hills were used to pay down the existing  million loan on the center  the northlake construction loan and our revolver

other income we have certain additional sources of income beyond our rental revenues  recoveries from tenants  and revenues from management  leasing  and development services  as summarized in the following table 
lease cancellation revenue is dependent on the overall economy and performance of particular retailers in specific locations and can vary significantly 
gains on peripheral land sales can also vary significantly from year to year  depending on the results of negotiations with tenants  counterparties  and potential purchasers of land  as well as the timing of the transactions

the loan agreement has a three year term  with two one year extension options 
the loan is interest only for the entire term  except during the second one year extension option  if elected 
we also entered into an agreement to swap the floating rate for an all in fixed rate of for the initial three year term of the loan agreement

application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the financial statements and disclosures 
some of these estimates and assumptions require application of difficult  subjective  and or complex judgment  often about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
we are required to make such estimates and assumptions when applying the following accounting policies 
valuation of shopping centers all properties  including those under construction and or owned by joint ventures  are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
impairment of a shopping center owned by consolidated entities would be recognized when the sum of expected cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges is less than the carrying value of the property 
other than temporary impairment of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is recognized when the carrying value is not considered recoverable based on evaluation of the severity and duration of the decline in value  including the results of discounted cash flow and other valuation techniques 
the expected cash flows of a shopping center are dependent on estimates and other factors subject to change  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  increases in operating costs  bankruptcy and or other changes in the condition of third parties  including anchors and tenants  and expected holding period 
these factors could cause our expected future cash flows from a shopping center to change  and  as a result  an impairment could be considered to have occurred 
to the extent an impairment has occurred  the excess carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value is charged against operations 
there were no impairment charges recognized in   and as of december   the consolidated net book value of our properties was billion  representing over of our consolidated assets 
we also have varying ownership percentages in the properties of unconsolidated joint ventures with a total combined net book value of billion 
these amounts include certain development costs that are described in the policy that follows 
capitalization of development costs in developing shopping centers  we typically obtain land or land options  zoning and regulatory approvals  anchor commitments  and financing arrangements during a process that may take several years and during which we may incur significant costs 
we capitalize all development costs once it is considered probable that a project will reach a successful conclusion 
prior to this time  we expense all costs relating to a potential development  including payroll  and include these costs in funds from operations see presentation of operating results 
many factors in the development of a shopping center are beyond our control  including changes in the national  regional  and or local economic climates  competition from other shopping centers  stores  clubs  mailings  and the internet  availability and cost of financing  changes in regulations  laws  and zoning  and decisions made by third parties  including anchors 
these factors could cause our assessment of the probability of a development project reaching a successful conclusion to change 
if a project subsequently was considered less than probable of reaching a successful conclusion  a charge against operations for previously capitalized development costs would occur 
our million balance of development pre construction costs as of december  consists primarily of approximately million of costs relating to our oyster bay project 
the balance also includes approximately million of land and improvement costs for a parcel in north atlanta  georgia  which was acquired for future development 
a portion of this land is expected to be sold for various uses 
see liquidity and capital resources planned capital spending regarding the status of the oyster bay project and others 
valuation of accounts and notes receivable rents and expense recoveries from tenants are our principal source of income  they represent over of our revenues 
in generating this income  we will routinely have accounts receivable due from tenants 
the collectibility of tenant receivables is affected by bankruptcies  changes in the economy  and the ability of the tenants to perform under the terms of their lease agreements 
while we estimate potentially uncollectible receivables and provide for them through charges against income  actual experience may differ from those estimates 
also  if a tenant were not able to perform under the terms of its lease agreement  receivable balances not previously provided for may be required to be charged against operations 
bad debt expense was less than of total revenues in  while bankruptcy filings affected of tenant leases during the year 
since  the annual provision for losses on accounts receivable has been less than of annual revenues 
notes receivable at december  totaled million  of which million related to the sale of residual land 
land contracts are collateralized by the sold properties 
valuation of deferred tax assets our taxable reit subsidiaries trss currently have deferred tax assets  reflecting net operating loss carryforwards and the impact of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the bases of such assets and liabilities as measured by tax laws 
our temporary differences primarily relate to deferred compensation and depreciation 
we reduce our deferred tax assets through valuation allowances to the amount where realization is more likely than not assured  considering all available evidence  including expected future taxable earnings and potential tax planning strategies 
expected future taxable earnings and the implementation of tax planning strategies require certain significant judgments and estimates  including those relating to our management company s profitability  the timing and amounts of gains on land sales  the profitability of our asian operations  and other factors affecting the results of operations of our trss 
changes in any of these factors could cause our estimates of the realization of deferred tax assets to change materially 
as of december   we had a consolidated gross federal and foreign deferred tax asset of million  reduced to a net deferred tax asset of million by a valuation allowance of million 
in addition  the enactment of the michigan business tax act and the related amendment resulted in both a deferred tax liability and deferred tax asset  balances of which were approximately million each as of december  during  our deferred michigan business tax expense was immaterial 
valuations for acquired property and intangibles upon acquisition of an investment property  including that of an additional interest in an asset already partially owned  we make an assessment of the valuation and composition of assets and liabilities acquired 
these assessments consider fair values of the respective assets and liabilities and are determined based on estimated future cash flows using appropriate discount and capitalization rates and other commonly accepted valuation techniques 
the estimated future cash flows that are used for this analysis reflect the historical operations of the property  known trends and changes expected in current market and economic conditions which would impact the property s operations  and our plans for such property 
these estimates of cash flows and valuations are particularly important given the application of fasb statement nos 
and for the allocation of purchase price between land  building and improvements  and other identifiable intangibles

considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements in new accounting pronouncements see note new accounting pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements regarding certain new accounting pronouncements that we expect to adopt in and presentation of operating results the following tables contain the operating results of our consolidated businesses and the unconsolidated joint ventures 
income allocated to the minority partners in the operating partnership and preferred interests is deducted to arrive at the results allocable to our common shareowners 
because the net equity of the operating partnership is less than zero  the income allocated to the minority partners under current accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america is equal to their share of distributions 
the net equity of these minority partners is less than zero due to accumulated distributions in excess of net income and not as a result of operating losses

use of non gaap measures the operating results in the following tables include the supplemental earnings measures of beneficial interest in ebitda and funds from operations ffo 
beneficial interest in ebitda represents the operating partnership s share of the earnings before interest and depreciation and amortization  excluding gains on sales of depreciated operating properties of its consolidated and unconsolidated businesses 
we believe beneficial interest in ebitda provides a useful indicator of operating performance  as it is customary in the real estate and shopping center business to evaluate the performance of properties on a basis unaffected by capital structure 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from extraordinary items and sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we believe that ffo is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for reits 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  we and most industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results that exclude historical cost depreciation to be useful in evaluating the operating performance of reits 
we primarily use ffo in measuring performance and in formulating corporate goals and compensation 
our presentations of ebitda and ffo are not necessarily comparable to the similarly titled measures of other reits due to the fact that not all reits use the same definitions 
these measures should not be considered alternatives to net income loss or as an indicator of our operating performance 
additionally  neither represents cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap

estimates of future capital spending include only projects approved by our board of directors and  consequently  estimates will change as new projects are approved 
costs of potential development projects  including our exploration of development possibilities in asia  are expensed until we conclude that it is probable that the project will reach a successful conclusion 
given the high probability of our moving forward on projects in salt lake city and macao  we are capitalizing our costs 
as of december   the combined capitalized costs of these projects were million 
both projects are under construction  although it may be some time before the contingencies on the macao project are met and the final agreements on the city creek center project are executed because of their complexity 
until then  costs of these projects excluding the million initial macao payment will continue to be relatively modest 
disclosures regarding planned capital spending  including estimates regarding capital expenditures  occupancy  and returns on new developments presented below are forward looking statements and certain significant factors could cause the actual results to differ materially  including but not limited to actual results of negotiations with anchors  tenants  and contractors  timing and outcome of litigation and entitlement processes  changes in the scope  number  and valuation of projects  cost overruns  timing of expenditures  financing considerations  actual time to complete projects  changes in economic climate  competition from others attracting tenants and customers  increases in operating costs  timing of tenant openings  and early lease terminations and bankruptcies 
new centers we are finalizing a development agreement regarding city creek center  a mixed use project in salt lake city  utah 
the project is currently under construction and is now expected to open in late the million square foot retail component of the project will include macy s and nordstrom as anchors 
we have been a consultant throughout the planning process for this project and are finalizing agreements to develop  manage  lease  and own the retail space under a participating lease 
when we have finalized these complex agreements  we will provide the anticipated costs and returns 
in june  the supreme court of the state of new york suffolk county affirmed that the town of oyster bay had not provided a basis to deny our application to build our oyster bay project in syosset  long island  new york 
in september  the oyster bay town board adopted a resolution citing its reasons for denying our application for a special use permit and submitted it to the court 
we responded with a motion asking the court to order the town to issue the permit 
we continue to be confident that it is probable we will prevail and build the mall  which has over of the space committed and will be anchored by neiman marcus  nordstrom  and barney s new york 
once the litigation is fully resolved and permits are issued  we are ready to begin construction 
however  if we are ultimately unsuccessful  it is anticipated that the recovery on this asset would be significantly less than our current investment 
depending on the timing of the construction and opening of the center  we anticipate spending as much as million on the project and receiving a minimum return 
our investment in this project as of december  was million 
with capitalized interest  storage costs  leasing  and other ongoing expenditures  we expect our investment to increase million to million each quarter 
if we were to determine for any period that sufficient development activities were not underway to permit capitalization of interest and other carrying costs  these costs  which comprise the majority of the quarterly spending  would be expensed as incurred 
in  we entered into an agreement to provide development services for a million square foot retail and entertainment complex in songdo international business district songdo  incheon  south korea
