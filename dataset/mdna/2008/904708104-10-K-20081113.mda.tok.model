sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  establishes standards for reporting information regarding operating segments in annual financial statements and requires selected information of those segments to be presented in interim financial reports issued to shareholders 
operating segments are identified as components of an enterprise for which separate discrete financial information is available for evaluation by the chief operating decision maker  or decision making group  in making decisions on how to allocate resources and assess performance 
our chief operating decision maker  as defined under sfas no 
 is our chief executive officer 
we have six operating segments based on the information reviewed by our chief executive officer us rental and cleaning  canadian rental and cleaning  manufacturing mfg  specialty garments rental and cleaning specialty garments  first aid and corporate 
the us rental and cleaning and canadian rental and cleaning operating segments have been combined to form the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment 
refer to note of our consolidated financial statements for our disclosure of segment information 
the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment purchases  rents  cleans  delivers and sells  uniforms and protective clothing and non garment items in the united states and canada 
the operations of the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment are referred to by us as our industrial laundry operations and we refer to the locations related to this reporting segment as our industrial laundries 
the mfg operating segment designs and manufactures uniforms and non garment items primarily for the purpose of providing these goods to the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment 
the amounts reflected as revenues of mfg are generated when goods are shipped from our manufacturing facilities to our other locations 
these revenues are recorded at a transfer price which is typically in excess of the actual manufacturing cost 
the transfer price is determined by our management and may not necessarily represent the fair value of the products manufactured 
products are carried in inventory and subsequently placed in service and amortized at this transfer price 
on a consolidated basis  intercompany mfg revenues and mfg income are eliminated and the carrying value of inventories and rental merchandise in service is reduced to the manufacturing cost 
income before income taxes from mfg  net of the intercompany mfg elimination  was million  million  and million for the years ended august   august  and august   respectively 
this income offsets the merchandise amortization costs incurred by the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment as the merchandise costs of this reporting segment are amortized and recognized based on inventories purchased from mfg at the transfer price which is above our manufacturing cost 
the corporate operating segment consists of costs associated with our distribution center  sales and marketing  information systems  engineering  materials management  manufacturing planning  finance  budgeting  human resources  other general and administrative costs and interest expense 
the revenues generated from the corporate operating segment represent certain direct sales made directly from our distribution center 
the products sold by this operating segment are the same products rented and sold by the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment 
in the segment disclosures in note to our consolidated financial statements  no assets or capital expenditures are presented for the corporate operating segment as no assets are allocated to this operating segment in the information reviewed by our chief executive officer 
however  depreciation and amortization expense related to certain assets are reflected in income from operations and income before income taxes for the corporate operating segment 
the assets that give rise to this depreciation and amortization are included in the total assets of the us and canadian rental and cleaning reporting segment as this is how they are tracked and reviewed by us 
we refer to our us and canadian rental and cleaning  mfg  and corporate segments combined as our core laundry operations 
the specialty garments operating segment purchases  rents  cleans  delivers and sells  specialty garments and non garment items primarily for nuclear and clean room applications 
the first aid operating segment sells first aid cabinet services and other safety supplies 
approximately of our revenues in fiscal were derived from us and canadian rental and cleaning  and corporate 
a key driver of this business is the number of workers employed by our customers 
our revenues are directly impacted by fluctuations in these employment levels 
revenues from specialty garments  which accounted for of our revenues  increase during outages and refueling by nuclear power plants  as garment usage increases at these times 
first aid represented of our total revenue in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements is in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates are based on historical information  current trends  and information available from other sources 
the actual results could differ from our estimates 
foreign currency translation the functional currency of our foreign operations is the local country s currency 
transaction gains and losses  including gains and losses on our intercompany transactions  are included in other expense income  in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
assets and liabilities of operations outside the united states are translated into us dollars using period end exchange rates 
revenues and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during each month of the fiscal year 
the effects of foreign currency translation adjustments are included in shareholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize revenue from rental operations in the period in which the services are provided 
direct sale revenue is recognized in the period in which the services are performed or when the product is shipped 
our judgment and estimates are used in determining the collectability of accounts receivable and evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we consider specific accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and the age of outstanding balances as part of our evaluation 
changes in our estimates are reflected in the period they become known 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
material changes in our estimates may result in significant differences in the amount and timing of bad debt expense recognition for any given period 
inventories and rental merchandise in service our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value  net of any reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to our customers or used in our rental operations 
historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both excess and obsolete inventories 
if actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than the amount we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we use the first in  first out fifo method to value our inventories  which primarily consist of finished goods 
rental merchandise in service is being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated service lives of the merchandise  which range from to months 
in establishing estimated lives for merchandise in service  our management considers historical experience and the intended use of the merchandise 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of operating profit for any period if we make significant changes to our estimates 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
sfas no 
requires that companies test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
in addition  sfas no 
also requires that companies test goodwill if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit to which goodwill is assigned below its carrying amount 
our evaluation considers changes in the operating environment  competitive information  market trends  operating performance and cash flow modeling 
we complete our annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and there have been no impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets in fiscal  or or any events or circumstances that would indicate that there may have been any impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets during such periods 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangibles associated with previously acquired businesses are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
property and equipment and definite lived intangible assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
long lived assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate an asset may be impaired 
there were no material impairments of property and equipment or definite lived intangible assets in fiscal  or insurance we self insure for certain obligations related to health  workers compensation  vehicles and general liability programs 
we also purchase stop loss insurance policies to protect ourselves from catastrophic losses 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for events that have occurred  but have not been reported 
our estimates consider historical claim experience and other factors 
our liabilities are based on our estimates  and  while we believe that our accruals are adequate  the ultimate liability may be significantly different from the amounts recorded 
changes in our claim experience  our ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments we use could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any given period 
environmental and other contingencies we are subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of our business operations  including environmental matters  personal injury  customer contract matters and employment claims 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability  as well as the amount to be recorded 
we regularly consult with our attorneys and outside consultants to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are being considered  before a contingent liability is recorded 
we record accruals for environmental and other contingencies based on enacted laws  regulatory orders or decrees  our estimates of costs  insurance proceeds  participation by other parties  the timing of payments  and the input of our attorneys and outside consultants 
the estimated liability for environmental contingencies has been discounted using risk free interest rates ranging from to over periods ranging from ten to thirty years 
the estimated current costs  net of legal settlements with insurance carriers  have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at per year 
changes in enacted laws  regulatory orders or decrees  our estimates of costs  insurance proceeds  participation by other parties  the timing of payments and the input of our attorneys and outside consultants based on changing legal or factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for our environmental and other contingent liabilities 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion and analysis 
asset retirement obligations we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which generally applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
under this accounting method  we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
we have recognized as a liability the present value of the estimated future costs to decommission our nuclear laundry facilities in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we depreciate  on a straight line basis  the amount added to property and equipment and recognize accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the various remaining lives which range from approximately one to twenty three years 
our estimated liability has been based on historical experience in decommissioning nuclear laundry facilities  estimated useful lives of the underlying assets  external vendor estimates as to the cost to decommission these assets in the future  and federal and state regulatory requirements 
the estimated current costs have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at per year 
the liability has been discounted using credit adjusted risk free rates that range from approximately to 
revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in the estimated useful lives of the underlying assets  estimated dates of decommissioning  changes in decommissioning costs  changes in federal or state regulatory guidance on the decommissioning of such facilities  or other changes in estimates 
changes due to revisions in our estimates will be recognized by adjusting the carrying amount of the liability and the related long lived asset if the assets are still in service  or charged to expense in the period if the assets are no longer in service 
derivative financial instruments we account for our derivative instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and related authoritative guidance 
all derivative instruments are recorded as other assets or other liabilities at fair value  which is calculated as an estimate of the future cash flows  and subsequent changes in a derivative s fair value are recognized in income  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
cash flows associated with derivatives are classified in the same category as the cash flows hedged in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are classified as a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be paid related to a recognized liability or a forecasted transaction 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until expense from the cash flows of the hedged items are recognized 
we perform an assessment at the inception of the hedge and on a quarterly basis thereafter  to determine whether our derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the value of the hedged items 
any changes in the fair value resulting from hedge ineffectiveness  is immediately recognized as income or expense 
our hedging activities are transacted only with highly rated institutions  reducing our exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance 
supplemental executive retirement plan and other pension plans we account for our supplemental executive retirement plan and other pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pension  as amended by sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
under sfas no 
 pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees estimated service periods 
pension expense calculated under sfas no 
is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements 
the calculation of pension expense and the corresponding liability requires us to use of a number of critical assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
changes in our assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on pension plan assets decreases 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in our pension plans will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the amounts recognized for income tax and financial reporting purposes at currently enacted tax rates 
we compute income tax expense by jurisdiction based on our operations in each jurisdiction 
we are periodically reviewed by domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these reviews include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
in evaluating the exposure associated with various filing positions  we recorded estimated reserves for probable exposures  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  through august  on august   we adopted fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which fundamentally changed the way we are required to treat our uncertain tax positions for financial accounting purposes 
refer to recent accounting pronouncements  in note to the consolidated financial statements and note  income taxes  for further discussion regarding our adoption of fin no

we believe that current cash and cash equivalent balances  cash generated from operations and amounts available under our amended credit agreement defined below will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements

these inflows were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  an increase in rental merchandise in service of million  and an increase in inventories of million 
we used cash to  among other things  fund million in capital expenditures and fund the acquisition of businesses of approximately million 
our long term debt increased by approximately million as a result of million of borrowings offset by million of payments during the year ended august  long term debt and borrowing capacity 
as of september   we had a million unsecured revolving credit agreement credit agreement with a syndicate of banks  which would have matured on september  however  on september   we amended our credit agreement 
this new agreement amended credit agreement matures on september  and allows for maximum outstanding borrowings of million 
under the amended credit agreement  we can borrow funds at variable interest rates based on the eurodollar rate or the bank s prime rate  as selected by us 
availability of credit requires our compliance with certain amended financial and other covenants  including a maximum funded debt ratio and minimum interest coverage as defined in the amended credit agreement 
we generally test our compliance with these financial covenants on a fiscal quarterly basis 
at august   the interest rates applicable to our borrowings under the amended credit agreement were calculated as libor plus basis points at the time of the respective borrowing and ranged from to 
as of august   we had outstanding borrowings of approximately million and outstanding letters of credit of million  which leaves million available for borrowing 
on june   we issued million of fixed and floating rate notes pursuant to a note purchase agreement note agreement 
under the note agreement  we issued million of notes with a seven year term june bearing interest at fixed rate notes 
we also issued million of floating rate notes due in ten years june floating rate notes 
of the floating rate notes  million bore interest at libor plus basis points and were repaid in september the remaining million bore interest at libor plus basis points and were repaid at face value on september on september   we issued million of floating rates notes floating rate notes pursuant to a note purchase agreement note agreement 
the floating rate notes mature on september   bear interest at libor plus basis points and may be repaid at face value two years from the date of issuance 
the proceeds from the issuance of the floating rate notes were used to first repay the million of outstanding floating rate notes and then to pay down outstanding amounts under the amended credit agreement 
as of august   we were in compliance with all the covenants under the amended credit agreement  the note agreement and the note agreement 
in january  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and the related effect on our variable rate debt 
the swap agreement  with a notional amount of million  matures on march  we pay a fixed rate of and receive a variable rate tied to the three month libor rate 
we have accounted for this instrument as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
and  as a result  have recorded all changes in the fair value of the swap agreement in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
for additional information on the interest rate swap  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental and legal contingencies we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations governing  among other things  the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and other substances 
in particular  industrial laundries currently use and must dispose of detergent waste water and other residues  and  in the past  used perchloroethylene and other dry cleaning solvents 
we are attentive to the environmental concerns surrounding the disposal of these materials and have  through the years  taken measures to avoid their improper disposal 
over the years  we have settled  or contributed to the settlement of  actions or claims brought against us relating to the disposal of hazardous materials and there can be no assurance that we will not have to expend material amounts to remediate the consequences of any such disposal in the future 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability  as well as the amount to be recorded 
we regularly consult with attorneys and outside consultants to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered  before a contingent liability is recorded 
changes in enacted laws  regulatory orders or decrees  management s estimates of costs  insurance proceeds  participation by other parties  the timing of payments and the input of outside consultants and attorneys based on changing legal or factual circumstances could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for environmental and other contingent liabilities 
under environmental laws  an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on  or in  or emanating from such property  as well as related costs of investigation and property damage 
such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or lessee knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
there can be no assurances that acquired or leased locations have been operated in compliance with environmental laws and regulations or that future uses or conditions will not result in the imposition of liability upon our company under such laws or expose our company to third party actions such as tort suits 
we continue to address environmental conditions under terms of consent orders negotiated with the applicable environmental authorities or otherwise with respect to sites located in or related to woburn  massachusetts  somerville  massachusetts  springfield  massachusetts  uvalde  texas  stockton  california  three sites in williamstown  vermont  as well as a number of additional locations that we acquired as part of our acquisition of textilease corporation in september we have accrued certain costs related to the sites described above as it has been determined that the costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we continue to investigate environmental conditions at the somerville  massachusetts site 
the full nature and extent of those conditions  and of the remedial solutions that may be employed to address them  have not yet been finally determined 
in the interim  as the investigation proceeds  we are implementing measures to mitigate potential impacts in the vicinity of the site 
we also have potential exposure related to an additional parcel of land the central area related to the woburn  massachusetts site discussed above 
currently  the consent order for the woburn  massachusetts site discussed above does not define or require any remediation work in the central area 
we have not accrued for this contingency as we believe  at this time  the liability is not probable and the amount of such contingent liability cannot be reasonably estimated 
we routinely review and evaluate sites that may require remediation and monitoring and determine our estimated costs based on various estimates and assumptions 
these estimates are developed using our internal sources or by third party environmental engineers or other service providers 
internally developed estimates are based on management s judgment and experience in remediating and monitoring the company s sites  information available from regulatory agencies as to costs of remediation and monitoring  the number  financial resources and relative degree of responsibility of other potentially responsible parties prps who may be liable for remediation and monitoring of a specific site  and  the typical allocation of costs among prps 
there is usually a range of reasonable estimates of the costs associated with each site 
we generally use the amount within the range that constitutes our best estimate 
when we believe that both the amount of a particular liability and the timing of the payments are reliably determinable  we adjust the cost in current dollars using a rate of for inflation until the time of expected payment and discount the cost to present value using risk free interest rates ranging from to 
for environmental liabilities that have been discounted  we include interest accretion  based on the effective interest method  in operating costs on the consolidated statements of income 
the changes to our environmental liabilities for the years ended august  and august  are as follows in thousands year ended august  august  beginning balance costs incurred for which reserves have been provided insurance proceeds received interest accretion revision in estimates ending balance in fiscal and  we made adjustments to increase our environmental related reserves by million and million  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to an ongoing investigation at one of our environmental exposure sites 
anticipated payments and insurance proceeds of currently identified environmental remediation liabilities as of august  for the next five years and thereafter as measured in current dollars are reflected below 
in thousands thereafter total estimated costs current dollars estimated insurance proceeds net anticipated costs effect of inflation effect of discounting balance as of august  estimated insurance proceeds are primarily received from an annuity received as part of our legal settlement with an insurance company 
annual proceeds of approximately million are deposited into an escrow account which funds remediation and monitoring costs for three sites related to our former operations in williamstown  vermont 
annual proceeds received but not expended in the current year accumulate in this account and may be used in future years for costs related to this site through the year as of august  the balance in this escrow account  which is held in a trust and is not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet  was approximately million 
also included in estimated insurance proceeds are amounts we are entitled to receive pursuant to legal settlements as reimbursements from three insurance companies for estimated costs at the site in uvalde  texas 
our nuclear garment decontamination facilities are licensed by the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  or  in certain cases  by the applicable state agency  and are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
there can be no assurance that such regulation will not lead to material disruptions in our garment decontamination business 
from time to time  we are also subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of our business operations  including litigation related to charges for certain ancillary services on invoices  personal injury claims  customer contract matters  employment claims and environmental matters as described above 
while it is impossible for us to ascertain the ultimate legal and financial liability with respect to contingent liabilities  including lawsuits and environmental contingencies  we believe that the aggregate amount of such liabilities  if any  in excess of amounts we have accrued or are covered by insurance  will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that our future financial position and or results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or strategies related to these contingencies or changes out of our control 
acquisitions as part of our business  we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other garment service companies 
in recent years  we have typically paid for acquisitions with cash and may continue to do so in the future 
to pay for an acquisition  we may use cash on hand  cash generated from operations or borrowings under our amended credit agreement  or we may pursue other forms of debt financing 
our ability to secure short term and long term debt financing in the future will depend on several factors  including our future profitability  our levels of debt and equity  and the overall credit and equity market environments 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following information is presented as of august  in thousands 
payments due by fiscal period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years private placement revolving credit agreement other debt total debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations as discussed above under long term debt and borrowing capacity  as of august   we had borrowing capacity of million under our amended credit agreement  of which approximately million was available for borrowing 
also  as of such date  we had outstanding borrowings of million included in bank debt in the above schedule and letters of credit of million 
all letters of credit expire in less than one year 
seasonality historically  our revenues and operating results have varied from quarter to quarter and are expected to continue to fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations have been due to a number of factors  including general economic conditions in our markets  the timing of acquisitions and of commencing start up operations and related costs  our effectiveness in integrating acquired businesses and start up operations  the timing of nuclear plant outages  capital expenditures  seasonal rental and purchasing patterns of our customers  and price changes in response to competitive factors 
in addition  our operating results historically have been lower during the second and fourth fiscal quarters than during the other quarters of the fiscal year 
the operating results for any historical quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for an entire fiscal year or any other interim periods 
effects of inflation in general  we believe that our results of operations are not dependent on moderate changes in the inflation rate 
historically  we have been able to manage the impacts of more significant changes in inflation rates through our customer relationships  customer agreements that generally provide for price increases consistent with the rate of inflation  and continued focus on improvements of operational productivity 
energy costs energy costs associated with operating our fleet of delivery trucks increased during fiscal year significant increases in energy costs  specifically natural gas and gasoline  can materially affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our energy costs  which include fuel  natural gas  and electricity  represent approximately of our total revenue

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we have determined that all of our foreign subsidiaries operate primarily in local currencies that represent the functional currencies of such subsidiaries 
all assets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars using the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date 
the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities are recorded as a component of shareholders equity 
income and expense accounts are translated at average exchange rates during the year 
as such  our financial condition and operating results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to currencies in foreign countries 
revenue denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented approximately  and of our total consolidated revenues for the fiscal years ended august   august  and august   respectively 
total assets denominated in currencies other than the us dollar represented approximately   and of our total consolidated assets at august   august  and august   respectively 
if exchange rates had increased or decreased by from the actual rates in effect during the year ended august   our revenues and assets for the year ended and as of august  would have increased or decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
we do not operate a hedging program to mitigate the effect of a significant change in the value of our foreign subsidiaries functional currencies  which include the canadian dollar  euro  british pound  and mexican peso  as compared to the us dollar 
any gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions  including exchange rate fluctuations on intercompany accounts are reported as transaction gains losses in our other expense income 
the intercompany payables and receivables are denominated in canadian dollars  euros  british pounds and mexican pesos 
during the year ended august   transaction losses included in other expense income were million 
if the exchange rates had increased or decreased by during the year ended august   we would have recognized an exchange gain or loss  as applicable  of approximately million 
interest rate sensitivity we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates which may adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in seeking to minimize the risks from interest rate fluctuations  we manage these exposures through our regular operating and financing activities 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our borrowings under our million amended credit agreement with a syndicate of banks and our floating rate notes which were purchased by a group of insurance companies pursuant to the note agreement 
under both agreements  we borrow funds at variable interest rates based on the eurodollar rate or libor rates 
if the libor and eurodollar rates fluctuated by from the actual rates in effect during the year ended august   our interest expense would have fluctuated by approximately million from the interest expense recognized for the year ended august  in january  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and the related effect on our variable rate debt 
the swap agreement  with a notional amount of million  matures on march  we pay a fixed rate of and receive a variable rate tied to the three month libor rate 
we have accounted for this instrument as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
and  as a result  have recorded all changes in the fair value of the swap agreement in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity
