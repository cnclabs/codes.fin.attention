item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading provider of semiconductor solutions in the rapidly growing broadband wireless and wireline communications markets 
our products include power amplifiers  tuner integrated circuits  active splitters  line amplifiers and other components  which can be sold individually or packaged as integrated radio frequency and front end modules 
we believe that we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the rapidly growing voice  data and video segments of the broadband wireless and wireline communications markets 
we offer g products that use the w cdma  edge and wedge standards  g products that use hspa and evdo standards  g products for wimax systems  wifi products that use the a b g and n mimo standards  catv cable modem and set top box products  catv infrastructure products and fttp products 
our business strategy focuses on developing rf front end solutions and partnering with industry leading wireless chipset providers to incorporate our solutions into their reference designs 
our integrated solutions enable our customers to improve rf performance  power efficiency  reliability  time to market and the integration of chip components into single packages  while reducing the size  weight and cost of their products 
we have established longstanding relationships with several of the industry leading chipset suppliers and tier one customers 
for example  our relationships with qualcomm  intel  cisco and motorola have enabled us to develop rf products used in g  g  g wimax  wifi and catv products and to be the primary supplier with respect to such partners and customers 
other leading chipset suppliers and tier one customers with whom we are engaged include beceem  broadcom  htc  huawei  kyocera  lg electronics  marvell  murata  novatel  nxp  palm  rim  samsung  sierra wireless  texas instruments and zte 
we continue to focus on leveraging our technological and manufacturing advantages to remain a leading supplier of semiconductor solutions for broadband wireless and wireline communications 
we believe our patented ingap plus technology  which combines the bipolar technology of a pa hbt pa with the surface device technology of an rf active switch phemt on the same die  provides us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
additionally  we believe our ingap plus process and design technologies such as help provide a competitive advantage by enabling us to provide pas that consume less battery power and extend talk time for products in the g  g and g markets 
our primary fab  a state of the art six inch diameter gaas fab located at our corporate headquarters in warren  new jersey  has been operational since the increased utilization of our fab s manufacturing capacity has increased our gross margins  which has provided us with greater financial leverage 
we are actively exploring future sources of additional manufacturing capacity including the construction of a manufacturing facility in china  as well as pursuing relationships with foundries 
unlike traditional cmos silicon fabs that have short technology lifecycles and require frequent capital investments  gaas fabs are more similar to analog fabs that have long lifecycles and do not become quickly outdated 
our six inch wafer fab allows us to produce more than twice the rf die per wafer compared with the four inch wafer fabs still used by some of our competitors 
we experienced net sales growth of approximately  and during  and  respectively  as our broadband and wireless businesses benefited from unit growth  a better pricing environment and acceptance of new product developments with increased rf content and functionality 
the sales growth and leverage of our fixed manufacturing expense base  led to gross margin increases and resulted in current year profitability 
on april   we sold the majority of the operating assets of telcom devices inc telcom  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company to gtran camarillo  inc in exchange for and effectively ceased telcom s operations 
accordingly  the financial results  position and cashflow of telcom have been classified as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements for all periods presented 
on september   we purchased certain assets and assumed certain related obligations of the radio frequency group of fairchild semiconductor rf group 
the rf group staff of accepted employment with the company 
in early  we signed an agreement with ksnd in china to jointly construct a wafer fabrication facility 
we believe our markets are  and will continue to remain  competitive  which could result in continued quarterly volatility in our net sales 
this competition has resulted in  and is expected over the long term to continue to result in competitive or declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing market share 
we have only one reportable segment 
for financial information related to such segment and certain geographic areas  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies significant estimates general we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
such accounting policies may require management to exercise a higher degree of judgment and make estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when the title  risk and rewards of product ownership are transferred to the customer  price and terms are fixed  no significant vendor obligation exists and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we sell to certain distributors who are granted rights of return and exchange and certain price protection 
revenue is appropriately reserved for the portion of shipments subject to return  exchange or price protection until such rights expire 
we charge customers for the costs of certain contractually committed inventories that remain at the end of a product s life 
such amounts are recognized as cancellation revenue when cash is received 
the value of the inventory related to cancellation revenue may  in some instances  have been reserved during prior periods in accordance with our inventory obsolescence policy 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers failure to make payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to erode  making them unable to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty costs we provide for potential warranty claims by recording a current charge to income 
we estimate potential claims by examining historical returns and other information deemed critical and provide for an amount which we believe will cover future warranty obligations for products sold 
the accrued liability for warranty costs is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
stock based compensation effective january   we account for stock based compensation costs in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
r share based payment fas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to our employees and directors 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period which in most cases is the vesting period 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires considerable judgement  including estimating expected volatility  expected term and risk free interest rate 
our expected volatility is a combination of both company and peer company historical volatility 
the expected term of the stock options is based on several factors including historical observations of employee exercise patterns and expectations of employee exercise behavior in the future giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on the yield at the time of grant of a us treasury security with an equivalent remaining term 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
marketable securities available for sale securities are stated at fair value  as determined by quoted market prices  or as needed  broker dealer valuation models  with unrealized gains and losses reported in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss 
unrealized losses are reviewed by management and those considered other than temporary are recorded as a charge to income 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market lcm  using the first in  first out method 
in addition to lcm limitations  we reserve against inventory items for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is primarily based upon forecasted short term demand for the product and any change to the reserve arising from forecast revisions is reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
long lived assets long lived assets include fixed assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we regularly review these assets for indicators of impairment and assess the carrying value of the assets against market values 
when an impairment exists  we record an expense to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair market value 
goodwill and intangibles impairment we have intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
significant judgements are involved in the determination of the estimated useful lives for our other intangibles and whether the goodwill or other intangible assets are impaired 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
impairment of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by these assets is less than the carrying amounts of those assets 
long lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
management considers sensitivities to capacity  utilization and technological developments in making its assumptions 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the amount may not be realized 
during  we determined that it was no longer more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  and an adjustment to provide a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset was charged to income 
we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations the following table sets forth statements of operations data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expense selling and administrative expenses restructuring and other charges operating loss income interest income interest expense other income loss income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net loss income compared to net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the net sales improvement was primarily due to increased demand for wireless third generation technologies or g consisting of cdma evdo  edge  wedge  and w cdma power amplifiers used in wireless handsets and hand held devices and increased demand for broadband products such as wlan power amplifiers used in wireless personal computer access and rf integrated circuits used in cable and broadband applications 
specifically  net sales for the year ended december  for the company s wireless products increased to million compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the net sales improvement was primarily due to increased demand for power amplifiers for g applications of million or  which was partially offset by lower net sales in power amplifiers for gsm of million or  which resulted from the company s shift in market focus to g technologies 
specifically  net sales for the year ended december  for the company s broadband products increased to million or compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the net sales improvement was primarily due to increased demand for power amplifiers for wifi applications of million or and integrated circuits used in cable and infrastructure applications of million or 
geographically  net sales in asia increased to million from million in the increase was primarily driven by the increased demand for our wlan and g products 
gross margin 
gross margin for improved to of net sales  compared with of net sales in the prior year 
the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to the product mix of g technologies and wifi applications further supported by improved cost absorption generated through increased production volumes 
research development 
company sponsored research and development expenses increased during to million from million during the increase was primarily due to an expansion and focus in r d efforts on new product development  which required increased staffing costs 
additionally  on september  we purchased the rf group from fairchild semiconductor  which included the hiring a staff of employees 
non cash stock based compensation expense accounted for an increase of million in over selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased during to million from million in the increase was primarily due to increased sales and marketing efforts focused on addressing existing and potential market opportunities in g  wifi and broadband 
non cash stock based compensation expense accounted for an increase of million in over interest income 
interest income increased to million during from million in the increase was primarily due to higher average funds invested as a result of our underwritten public offering of million shares of common stock in march of the march offering and higher interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in in  interest expense arose from obligations under our convertible senior notes due in notes whereas in our convertible senior notes due in notes was also outstanding 
in november  we repaid the remaining million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our notes 
loss from discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations was million compared with million in the loss from discontinued operations in included million loss on the sale of telcom upon its sale at the close of the first quarter of other income expense 
other expense was million in  for which  million was recorded for an other than temporary decline in value on certain auction rate securities held by the company 
this was partly offset by gains on foreign currency transactions 
compared to net sales 
net sales during increased to million  compared to million for the net sales improvement was primarily due to new demand from the market s evolution to third generation edge  wedge and w cdma pas  an increase in demand for our traditional cdma and gsm technologies used in wireless handsets and hand held devices  and increased demand for broadband products such as wlan pas  used in wireless personal computer access and rfics  used in infrastructure applications 
sales during of rfics used for cellular and personal communication system applications increased during to million from million in this increase in sales of integrated circuits for wireless applications for the year ended december  compared with was primarily due to increased demand for our g  cdma and gsm pas amounting to million  million and million  respectively 
specifically  net sales of rfics used for broadband applications increased to million in from million in this increase in sales was primarily due to an increase in demand for infrastructure products and increased average selling prices for wlan products accounting for increases in sales of million and million  respectively 
sales of wlan pas benefited from the market transition from b g pas to a b g pas that have a higher selling price for the increased functionality 
gross margin 
gross margin for improved to of net sales  compared with of net sales in the prior year 
the increase in gross margin from the prior year is the result of the increase in net sales and production volumes with the consequent absorption of fixed costs 
research development 
company sponsored research and development expenses increased during to million from million during primarily due to accelerated customer demand for new product development  which led to increased staffing and costs in addition to increased stock based compensation of million 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased during to million from million in the increase was primarily due to increased stock based compensation of million 
restructuring and other charges 
during  we settled an exit obligation for certain redundant leasehold premises resulting in a savings of million against a previously recorded restructuring charge 
interest income 
interest income increased to million during from million in the increase was primarily due to higher average funds invested as a result of our underwritten public offering of million shares of common stock in march of the march offering and higher interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in interest expense arose from obligations under our convertible senior notes due in notes and our convertible senior notes due in notes 
in november  we repaid the remaining million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our notes 
loss from discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations was million compared with million in the loss increased primarily due to lower gross profit from a decrease in revenue from million to million 
liquidity and sources of capital at december  we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and million in marketable securities 
we had million aggregate principal amount of our notes outstanding as of december  operations generated million in cash during investing activities used million of cash during  consisting principally of purchases of equipment of million and net purchases of marketable securities of million 
financing activities provided million of cash in  primarily consisting of proceeds received from the issuance of stock  principally from the march offering as well as stock option exercises 
at december   the company had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately million  of which million relates to capital equipment purchase requirements primarily over the first half of such capital purchase requirements will serve to increase the installed equipment capacity of the company s manufacturing operations in response to increases in customer demand for the company s products 
in early  the company signed an agreement with ksnd in china to jointly construct a wafer fabrication facility 
the agreement requires the company to invest approximately million over a ten year period  inclusive of million required by january   of which approximately million has been funded as of december  in the event we decide unilaterally not to proceed with the agreement with ksnd  our maximum obligation under the agreement with ksnd is to pay ksnd million 
we believe that our existing sources of capital  including our existing cash and marketable securities  will be adequate to satisfy operational needs and anticipated capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
our anticipated capital needs may include acquisitions of complimentary businesses or technologies  investments in other companies or repurchases of our outstanding debt or equity 
subject to liquidity considerations of our auction rate securities as discussed more fully in item a  we may elect to finance all or part of our future capital requirements through additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available on satisfactory terms 
our ability to pay principal and interest on our million in outstanding convertible senior unsecured notes  which are due in october of  and our other debt and to fund our planned capital expenditures depends on our future operating performance 
the table below summarizes required cash payments as of december contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years long term debt plus the interest payable with respect thereto operating leases unconditional purchase obligations china funding commitment total contractual cash obligations if by january   we decide not to proceed with the construction of the ksnd fabrication facility  our maximum obligation under the ksnd agreement would be million reduced by payments made to the date of cancellation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our investments in certain available for sale securities 
our available for sale securities consist primarily of fixed income investments  including corporate bonds  commercial paper and federal  state  municipal  and government sponsored enterprises securities 
we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of issuers with respect to our available for sale securities 
accordingly  we believe that the effects of changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of these issuers are limited and would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  it is possible that we would be at risk if interest rates or the credit ratings of these issuers were to change in an unfavorable direction 
the magnitude of any gain or loss would be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
at december   we held marketable securities with an estimated fair value of million 
our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short term interest rates 
we do not purchase financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities 
the following table provides information about our marketable securities at december  estimated principal amount and weighted average stated rate by expected maturity value fair value s total s principal weighted average stated rates the stated rates of interest expressed in the above table may not approximate the actual yield of the securities which we currently hold since we have purchased some of our marketable securities at other than face value 
additionally  some of the securities represented in the above table may be called or redeemed  at the option of the issuer  prior to their expected due dates 
if such early redemptions occur  we may reinvest the proceeds realized on such calls or redemptions in marketable securities with stated rates of interest or yields that are lower than those of our current holdings  which would affect both future cash interest streams and future earnings 
in addition to investments in marketable securities  we invest some of our cash in money market funds in order to keep cash available to fund operations and to hold cash pending investments in marketable securities 
fluctuations in short term interest rates will affect the yield on monies invested in such money market funds 
such fluctuations can have an impact on our future cash interest streams and future earnings  but the impact of such fluctuations are not expected to be material 
all of our investment securities are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on our balance sheet at market value 
as of december   our short term investments included million of auction rate securities issued primarily by state and municipal authorities 
our auction rate securities are debt instruments with a long term maturity and with an interest rate that is reset in short intervals through auctions 
the recent conditions in the global credit markets have prevented some investors from liquidating their holdings of auction rate securities because the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders for such securities 
if there is insufficient demand for the securities at the time of an auction  the auction may not be completed and the interest rates may be reset to predetermined higher rates 
when auctions for these securities fail  the investments may not be readily convertible to cash until a future auction of these investments is successful or they are redeemed or mature 
if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate and any decline in market value is determined to be other than temporary  we would be required to adjust the carrying value of the investment through an impairment charge 
to date  we have not experienced any realized gains or losses on our investment portfolio but have recognized an other than temporary impairment approximating million 
in mid february   we were informed that there was insufficient demand at auctions for certain of our auction rate securities 
as a result  certain of these securities are currently not liquid and the interest rates on such securities have been reset to predetermined higher rates 
insufficient demand for certain auction rate securities may continue 
we may not be able to access cash by selling auction rate securities for which there is insufficient demand without the loss of principal until a future auction for these investments is successful  they are redeemed by their issuer or they mature 
if we are unable to sell these securities in the market or they are not redeemed  then we may be required to hold them to maturity 
we do not have a need to access these funds for operational purposes for the foreseeable future 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate these investments on an ongoing basis for impairment or for a short term to a long term reclassification 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate that the potential illiquidity of these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
our notes are convertible and bear a fixed rate of interest of 
a change in interest rates on long term debt is assumed to impact fair value but not earnings or cash flow because the interest rate is fixed 
at december   the fair value of our outstanding convertible notes  estimated based upon dealer quotes  was approximately million
