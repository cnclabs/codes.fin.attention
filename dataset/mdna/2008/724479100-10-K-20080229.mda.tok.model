item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in forward looking statements and elsewhere in this report 
overview revenue grew in to billion 
acquisitions and foreign currency translation contributed about and  respectively to this growth 
acquisitions for this year included mapinfo corporation  digital cement  and asterion sas 
income from continuing operations was million in compared with million in and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was in compared with in in  diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was reduced by restructuring and impairment charges of cents  cents for the purchase accounting alignment for mapinfo  and cents for tax adjustments  related principally to a valuation allowance for net operating losses outside the us in  diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was reduced by restructuring charges of cents and tax adjustments of cents and increased by cent from net legal settlements 
our software and mail services segments experienced strong results during these strong performances were offset by disappointing results in europe  weaker performance in the legal solutions portion of our management services segment  and lower sales at us mailing due to the wind down of meter migration 
in addition  weakness in certain sectors of the economy  such as financial services  adversely affected our results during the second half of on november   we announced a plan to lower our cost structure  accelerate efforts to improve operational efficiencies  and to transition our product line 
as a result of this program  we expect a net reduction of about  positions across business lines and geographies  representing approximately percent of the global employment base 
also  following a comprehensive review of our portfolio  we decided to explore strategic alternatives to determine the best course of action for our us management services business 
see results of operations for  and for a more detailed discussion of our results of operations 
outlook we believe that the actions we took in the fourth quarter of  and actions that we will continue to take in  will position us for sustained  long term improvement in earnings and increased shareholder value 
we expect to realize approximately million in pre tax annual benefits from these actions in we intend to reinvest the majority of these benefits in programs to improve our customers experience and our operational efficiencies 
we are targeting million in pre tax annual benefits by we plan to use about half of these benefits to improve customer processes and generate revenue 
we expect our mix of revenue to continue to change  with a greater percentage of revenue coming from diversified revenue streams associated with fully featured smaller systems and a smaller percentage from larger system sales 
we also expect a greater percentage of revenue growth from the software and mail services segments 
in addition  we expect to derive further synergies from our recent acquisitions 
we will continue to remain focused on enhancing our productivity and to allocate capital in order to optimize our returns

as a result of the purchase accounting alignment  the acquisition of mapinfo reduced our diluted earnings per share by cents in acquisitions made in did not materially impact income from continuing operations for that year 
during and  we also completed several smaller acquisitions for an aggregate cost of million and million  respectively 
these acquisitions did not have a material impact on our financial results either individually or on an aggregate basis 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that cash flow generated by operations  existing cash and liquid investments  as well as borrowing capacity under our commercial paper program  the existing credit facility and debt capital markets should be sufficient to finance our capital requirements and to cover our customer deposits for the foreseeable future 
our potential uses of cash include but are not limited to the following growth and expansion opportunities  internal investments  customer financing  tax payments  interest and dividend payments  share repurchase program  and potential acquisitions and divestitures 
cash flow summary the change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows dollars in millions cash provided by used in operating activities cash used in provided by investing activities cash used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows net cash provided by operations consisted primarily of net income adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the strong cash flow provided by operations for is primarily driven by tax refunds and lower tax payments  lower investment in finance receivables  and increased management attention on working capital which resulted in lower accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable balances 
net cash used in investing activities consisted of acquisitions of million and capital expenditures of million partially offset by proceeds from the sale of a training facility for million  proceeds from short term investments of million  and increased reserve account balances for customer deposits of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million and consisted primarily of stock repurchases of million and dividends paid of million  primarily offset by a net borrowing of debt of million and proceeds from stock issuance of million 
cash flows net cash used in operating activities decreased due to payments made to the irs in connection with the sale of capital services and the irs tax settlement 
these payments to the irs reflect taxes due from the sale of our imagistics lease portfolio and capital services external financing business as well as final payments for our settlement of all outstanding tax audit issues in dispute for tax years through december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the increase in accounts receivable decreased cash from operations by approximately million  primarily reflecting growth in sales of equipment and software licenses 
the increase in our internal finance receivables balances reduced cash from operations by million  reflecting growth in equipment placements and our payment solutions business during the year 
net cash provided by investing activities consisted primarily of proceeds of million received from the sale of our capital services external financing business  million received from the sale of our imagistics lease portfolio and an advance of million against the cash surrender value of our coli policies  offset by million in capital expenditures and million used for acquisitions 
net cash used in financing activities was million and consisted primarily of stock repurchases and dividends paid  offset by the issuance of debt  common stock and proceeds from preferred stock issued by a subsidiary 
capital expenditures during  capital expenditures included net additions of million to property  plant and equipment and million in net additions to rental equipment and related inventories compared with million and million  respectively  in the decrease in rental asset additions relates primarily to the wind down of our customers transition to digital meters 
financings and capitalization we have a commercial paper program that is a significant source of liquidity 
as of december   we had approximately million of outstanding commercial paper issuances and an unused credit facility of billion which supports commercial paper issuances 
in september  we issued million of unsecured fixed rate notes maturing in september these notes bear interest at an annual rate of and pay interest semi annually beginning in march the proceeds from these notes were used for general corporate purposes  including the repayment of commercial paper  the financing of acquisitions and repurchase of our stock 
in december  we entered into a million syndicated bank transaction priced at month libor plus basis points 
the proceeds from this credit facility  due  were used to pay off the million variable rate debt that was due in in addition to our borrowing capability under the unused credit facilities described above  we have billion available under the shelf registration statement filed in february with the sec  permitting issuances of up to billion in debt securities  preferred stock  preference stock  common stock  purchase contracts  depository shares  warrants and units 
we believe our financing needs in the short and long term can be met from cash generated internally  borrowing capacity from existing credit agreements  available debt issuances under existing shelf registration statements and our existing commercial paper program 
information on debt maturities is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following summarizes our known contractual obligations at december  and the effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years commercial paper borrowings long term debt and current portion of long term debt non cancelable operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations other non current liabilities total purchase obligations include unrecorded agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding upon us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable without penalty 
other non current liabilities relate primarily to our postretirement benefits 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the amount and period of future payments related to our fin income tax uncertainties cannot be reliably estimated and  therefore  is not included in the above table 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
we have discussed the impact and any associated risks on our results of operations related to these policies throughout the md a 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  customer cancellations  bad debts  inventory obsolescence  residual values of leased assets  useful lives of long lived assets and intangible assets  warranty obligations  restructuring  pensions and other postretirement benefits  contingencies and litigation  and allocation of purchase price to tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations 
our actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
we believe the assumptions and estimates used are reasonable and appropriate in accordance with gaap 
revenue recognition multiple element and internal financing arrangements we derive our revenue from multiple sources including sales  rentals  financing and services 
certain of our transactions are consummated at the same time and can therefore generate revenue from multiple sources 
the most common form of these transactions involves a non cancelable equipment lease  a meter rental and an equipment maintenance agreement 
as a result  we are required to determine whether the deliverables in a multiple element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if so  how the price should be allocated among the delivered elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
in multiple element arrangements  we recognize revenue for each of the elements based on their respective fair values in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the fair values of undelivered elements are known and uncertainties regarding customer acceptance are resolved 
our allocation of the fair values to the various elements does not change the total revenue recognized from a transaction  but impacts the timing of revenue recognition 
revenue is allocated to the meter rental and equipment maintenance agreement elements first using their respective fair values  which are determined based on prices charged in standalone and renewal transactions 
revenue is then allocated to the equipment based on the present value of the remaining minimum lease payments 
we then compare the allocated equipment fair value to the range of cash selling prices in standalone transactions during the period to ensure the allocated equipment fair value approximates average cash selling prices 
we provide lease financing for our products primarily through sales type leases 
we classify our leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
the vast majority of our leases qualify as sales type leases using the present value of minimum lease payments classification criteria outlined in sfas no 
we believe that our sales type lease portfolio contains only normal collection risk with no important uncertainties with respect to future costs 
accordingly  we record the fair value of equipment as sales revenue  the cost of equipment as cost of sales and the minimum lease payments plus the estimated residual value as gross finance receivables 
the difference between the gross finance receivable and the equipment fair value is recorded as unearned income and is amortized as income over the lease term using the interest rate implicit in the lease 
equipment residual values are determined at inception of the lease using estimates of equipment fair value at the end of the lease term 
estimates of future equipment fair value are based primarily on our historical experience 
we also consider forecasted supply and demand for our various products  product retirement and future product launch plans  end of lease customer behavior  regulatory changes  remanufacturing strategies  used equipment markets  if any  competition and technological changes 
we evaluate residual values on an annual basis or as changes to the above considerations occur 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the transition of our product line 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
we did not experience any material changes to our residual values during or see note to the consolidated financial statements for our accounting policies on revenue recognition 
allowances for doubtful accounts and credit losses allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our accounts receivable risks and provide allowances for doubtful accounts accordingly 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts on a periodic basis 
our evaluation includes historical loss experience  length of time receivables are past due  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to repay and prevailing economic conditions 
we make adjustments to our allowance if our evaluation of allowance requirements differs from our actual aggregate reserve 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available 
based on historical experience  we have not had any material revisions to our recorded allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowance for credit losses we estimate our finance receivables risks and provide allowances for credit losses accordingly 
we establish credit approval limits based on the credit quality of our customers and the type of equipment financed 
we charge finance receivables to the allowance for credit losses after collection efforts are exhausted and we deem the account uncollectible 
we base credit decisions primarily on a customer s financial strength 
we believe that our concentration of credit risk for finance receivables in our internal financing division is limited because of our large number of customers  small account balances and customer geographic and industry diversification 
our general policy for finance receivables contractually past due for over days is to discontinue revenue recognition 
we resume revenue recognition when payments reduce the account to days or less past due 
we evaluate the adequacy of allowance for credit losses on a periodic basis 
our evaluation includes historical loss experience  the nature and volume of our portfolios  adverse situations that may affect a customer s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
we make adjustments to our allowance for credit losses if the evaluation of reserve requirements differs from the actual aggregate reserve 
this evaluation is inherently subjective because our estimates may be revised as more information becomes available 
accounting for income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
when we prepare our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we record this amount as a provision for our taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which supplements statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes  by defining the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
fin requires a two step approach under which the tax effect of a position is recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained and the amount of the tax benefit recognized is equal to the largest tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement of the tax position 
this is a different standard for recognition than the approach previously required 
both approaches require us to exercise considerable judgment and estimates are inherent in both processes 
we regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and account for the related financial statement implications 
we have established tax reserves which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments 
determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law 
we adjust the amount of reserves when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserve is appropriate 
future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations 
based on our income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest  a change in our effective tax rate would impact income from continuing operations by approximately million 
long lived assets useful lives of long lived assets we depreciate property  plant and equipment and rental property and equipment principally using the straight line method over estimated useful lives machinery and equipment principally to years and buildings up to years 
we depreciate other depreciable assets using either the straight line method or accelerated methods 
we amortize properties leased under capital leases on a straight line basis over the primary lease terms 
we amortize capitalized costs related to internally developed software using the straight line method over the estimated useful life  which is principally to years 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which are principally to years 
our estimates of useful lives could be affected by changes in regulatory provisions  technology or business plans 
impairment review we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets  including goodwill and intangible assets  on an annual basis or as circumstances warrant 
our goodwill impairment review requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
we use internal discounted cash flow estimates  quoted market prices when available and appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
we derive the cash flow estimates from our historical experience and our future long term business plans and apply an appropriate discount rate 
when available and as appropriate  we use comparative market multiples to corroborate discounted cash flow results 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details on our transition initiatives and asset impairments recorded in we believe that we have no unrecorded asset impairments at december  however  future events and circumstances  some of which are described below  may result in an impairment charge changes in postal regulations governing the types of meters allowable for use 
new technological developments that provide significantly enhanced benefits over current technology 
significant negative economic or industry trends 
changes in our business strategy that alters the expected usage of the related assets 
future economic results that are below our expectations used in the current assessments 
pension benefits assumptions and estimates the valuation and calculation of our net pension expense  assets and obligations are dependent on various assumptions and estimates 
we make assumptions relating to discount rates  rate of compensation increase  expected return on plan assets and other factors 
these assumptions are evaluated and updated annually and are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following assumptions relate to our us qualified pension plan  which is our largest plan 
we determine our discount rate for the us retirement benefit plan by using a model that discounts each year s estimated benefit payments by an applicable spot rate 
these spot rates are derived from a yield curve created from a large number of high quality corporate bonds 
accordingly  our discount rate assumption was at december  and at december  the rate of compensation increase assumption reflects our actual experience and best estimate of future increases 
our estimate of the rate of compensation increase was at december  and our expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results  the plan s asset mix and future expectations of market rates of return on the types of assets in the plan 
our expected return on plan assets assumption was in and sensitivity to changes in assumptions discount rate a increase in the discount rate would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million 
rate of compensation increase a increase in the rate of compensation increase would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
expected return on plan assets a increase in the expected return on assets of our principal plans would decrease annual pension expense by approximately million 
delayed recognition principles in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  actual pension plan results that differ from our assumptions and estimates are accumulated and amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants and will therefore affect pension expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
we also base our net pension expense primarily on a market related valuation of plan assets 
in accordance with this approach  we recognize differences between the actual and expected return on plan assets primarily over a five year period and as a result future pension expense will be impacted when these previously deferred gains or losses are recorded

investment related risks and uncertainties we invest our pension plan assets in a variety of investment securities in accordance with our strategic asset allocation policy 
the composition of our us pension plan assets at december  was approximately equity securities  fixed income securities and real estate investments 
investment securities are exposed to various risks such as interest rate  market and credit risks 
in particular  due to the level of risk associated with equity securities  it is reasonably possible those changes in the values of such investment securities will occur and that such changes could materially affect our future results

in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which supplements statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes  by defining the confidence level that a tax position must meet in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
fin requires the tax effect of a position to be recognized only if it is more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits as of the reporting date 
if a tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on its technical merits  no benefits of the position are recognized 
this is a different standard for recognition than was previously required 
the more likely than not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of a benefit 
at adoption  companies adjusted their financial statements to reflect only those tax positions that were more likely than not to be sustained as of the adoption date 
any necessary adjustment was recorded directly to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption and reported as a change in accounting principle 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  which resulted in a decrease to opening retained earnings of million  with a corresponding increase in our tax liabilities 
in july  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  accounting for a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction  that provided guidance on how a change or a potential change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction affected the accounting by a lessor for the lease

 fair value measurements fas  to define how the fair value of assets and liabilities should be measured in accounting standards where it is allowed or required 
in addition to defining fair value  the statement establishes a framework within gaap for measuring fair value and expands required disclosures surrounding fair value measurements 
while it will change the way companies currently measure fair value  it does not establish any new instances where fair value measurement is required 
fas defines fair value as an amount that a company would receive if it sold an asset or paid to transfer a liability in a normal transaction between market participants in the same market where the company does business 
it emphasizes that the value is based on assumptions that market participants would use  not necessarily only the company that might buy or sell the asset

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provided guidance on how prior year misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for the purposes of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated 
sab allowed registrants to adjust for the cumulative effect of certain errors relating to prior years in the carrying amount of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the current year  with an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption provided that management had properly concluded that the errors were not material to prior periods 
sab was effective for fiscal years ending after november  in  we determined that the accounting for certain leveraged lease transactions in canada was misstated due to changes in assumptions having occurred prior to which impacted net income from the leases 
such changes in assumptions required the leveraged lease pricing models to be revised 
these misstatements were immaterial to periods prior to  however correction in that period would have had the effect of reducing our pre tax income and our tax provision by million and million  respectively  which was considered material to the financial statements 
accordingly  we corrected these misstatements by adjusting opening retained earnings in by million 
as part of this adjustment  we also decreased our investment in leveraged leases by million  increased other non current liabilities by million and decreased deferred taxes on income by million

fas r requires fair value measurements at the date of acquisition  with limited exceptions specified in the statement 
some of the major impacts of this new standard include expense recognition for transaction costs and restructuring costs 
fas r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and will be applied prospectively

it also establishes additional disclosures in the consolidated financial statements that identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent s owners and of the noncontrolling owners of a subsidiary 
fas requires changes in ownership interest that do not result in deconsolidation to be accounted for as equity transactions 
this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
this gain or loss is measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  fas requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests 
all other requirements of fas are applied prospectively

legal and regulatory matters legal see legal proceedings in item of this form k for information regarding our legal proceedings 
other the european union has instituted two environmental directives that impact our international operations 
the waste electrical and electronic equipment legislation  effective august   makes manufacturers responsible for the disposal of their equipment 
the restriction of hazardous substances directive rohs effective july  requires the removal of substances that are now considered actually or potentially hazardous  from future equipment placements 
as a result of the rohs directive  we have sought and received re approval for the placement of postage meters from the appropriate postal authorities in each country 
income taxes the current irs exam of tax years is estimated to be completed in the next year or two  and the federal statute of limitations for years prior to has expired 
in connection with the audit  we are currently disputing a recent formal request from the irs in the form of a civil summons to provide certain company workpapers 
the company believes that certain documents being sought should not be produced because they are privileged 
in the third quarter  in a similar case  the us district court in rhode island ruled that certain company workpapers were privileged 
the irs has appealed that decision 
a similar issue is also being litigated between the irs and another taxpayer before the us district court for the northern district of alabama 
in connection with the audit  we have recently entered into an agreement in principle with the irs regarding the tax treatment of certain capital services lease transactions 
the additional tax and interest associated with this settlement was accrued and paid to the irs prior to in  we accrued in discontinued operations an additional tax expense of million to record the impact of the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act tipra 
the tipra legislation repealed the exclusion from federal income taxation of a portion of the income generated from certain leveraged leases of aircraft by foreign sales corporations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of discontinued operations 
in august  we reached a settlement with the irs governing all outstanding tax audit issues in dispute for the tax years through these disputed items related primarily to the tax treatment of corporate owned life insurance coli and related interest expense  the tax effect of the sale of certain preferred share holdings  and the tax treatment of certain capital services lease transactions 
in the second quarter of  we estimated the tax due as a result of the irs settlement including our best estimate of the additional liability for these items in all open years  the sale of the imagistics portfolio and the sale of the capital services business to be approximately billion 
accordingly  we recorded million of additional tax expense 
the billion tax liability was net of million of irs tax bonds previously posted 
in the third quarter of  we paid million of the billion obligation to the irs  with the remainder paid by the end of these tax obligations were funded with proceeds previously received in from the sale of the imagistics lease portfolio and capital services and the advance against the cash surrender value of our coli assets 
of the million of tax expense  million related to the capital services business and was included in discontinued operations and million was included in continuing operations 
in january  the us circuit court of appeals reversed a district court decision that another company received related to the tax treatment of coli and related interest deductions 
as a result  we recorded additional tax reserves of million in our financial results 
we regularly assess the likelihood of tax adjustments in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we have operations and account for the related financial statement implications 
tax reserves have been established which we believe to be appropriate given the possibility of tax adjustments 
determining the appropriate level of tax reserves requires us to exercise judgment regarding the uncertain application of tax law 
the amount of reserves is adjusted when information becomes available or when an event occurs indicating a change in the reserve is appropriate 
future changes in tax reserve requirements could have a material impact on our results of operations 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable tax  interest and penalties that may result from these disputed matters as it relates to through and we believe that the accrual for tax liabilities is appropriate 
however  the resolution of such matters could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position and cash flow 
we are continually under examination by tax authorities in the united states  other countries and local jurisdictions in which we have operations 
the years under examination vary by jurisdiction 
effects of inflation and foreign exchange inflation  although moderate in recent years  continues to affect worldwide economies and the way companies operate 
it increases labor costs and operating expenses  and raises costs associated with replacement of fixed assets such as rental equipment 
despite these growing costs and the usps meter migration initiatives  we have generally been able to maintain profit margins through productivity and efficiency improvements  continual review of both manufacturing capacity and operating expense levels  and  where applicable  price increases 
currency translation increased our revenue by approximately 
also  currency translation gains increased our income before taxes by million 
based on the current contribution from our international operations  a increase in the value of the us dollar would result in a decline in revenue of approximately million and a decline in income from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interest of approximately million 
although not affecting income  balance sheet related deferred translation gains of million were recorded in resulting primarily from the stronger british pound  euro and canadian dollar  as compared to the us dollar 
during  we recorded deferred translation gains of million resulting primarily from the stronger british pound  euro and canadian dollar  as compared to the us dollar 
during  we recorded deferred translation losses of million resulting primarily from the weaker british pound and euro  partially offset by the stronger canadian dollar as compared with the us dollar 
the results of our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations 
we enter into foreign exchange contracts primarily to minimize our risk of loss from such fluctuations 
exchange rates can also impact settlement of our intercompany receivables and payables that result from transfers of finished goods inventories between our affiliates in different countries  and intercompany loans 
at december   we had million of foreign exchange contracts outstanding  all maturing in  to buy or sell various currencies 
as a result of the use of derivative instruments  we are exposed to counterparty risk 
to mitigate such risks  we enter into contracts with only those financial institutions that meet stringent credit requirements as set forth in our derivative policy 
we regularly review our credit exposure balances as well as the creditworthiness of our counterparties 
maximum risk of loss on these contracts is limited to the amount of the difference between the spot rate at the date of the contract delivery and the contracted rate 
dividends it is a general practice of our board of directors to pay a cash dividend on common stock each quarter 
in setting dividend payments  our board considers the dividend rate in relation to our recent and projected earnings and our capital investment opportunities and requirements 
we have paid a dividend each year since forward looking statements we want to caution readers that any forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of in this form k  other reports or press releases or made by our management involve risks and uncertainties which may change based on various important factors 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
these forward looking statements are those which talk about our current expectations as to the future and include  but are not limited to  statements about the amounts  timing and results of possible restructuring charges and future earnings 
words such as estimate  project  plan  believe  expect  anticipate  intend  and similar expressions may identify such forward looking statements 
some of the factors which could cause future financial performance to differ materially from the expectations as expressed in any forward looking statement made by or on our behalf include changes in international or national political conditions  including any terrorist attacks negative developments in economic conditions  including adverse impacts on customer demand changes in postal regulations timely development and acceptance of new products success in gaining product approval in new markets where regulatory approval is required successful entry into new markets mailers utilization of alternative means of communication or competitors products our success at managing customer credit risk our success at managing costs associated with our strategy of outsourcing functions and operations not central to our business changes in interest rates foreign currency fluctuations cost  timing and execution of our transition plans including any potential asset impairments regulatory approvals and satisfaction of other conditions to consummation of any acquisitions and integration of recent acquisitions interrupted use of key information systems changes in privacy laws intellectual property infringement claims impact on mail volume resulting from current concerns over the use of the mail for transmitting harmful biological agents third party suppliers ability to provide product components negative income tax adjustments for prior audit years and changes in tax laws or regulations changes in pension and retiree medical costs acts of nature item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations due to our investing and funding activities and our operations denominated in different foreign currencies 
we manage our exposure to changes in interest rates by limiting its impact on earnings and cash flows and lowering our overall borrowing costs 
we use a balanced mix of debt maturities and variable and fixed rate debt together with interest rate swaps to execute our strategy 
our objective in managing our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility in earnings and cash flows associated with the effect of foreign exchange rate changes on transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies 
accordingly  we enter into various contracts  which change in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of external and intercompany transactions 
the principal currencies actively hedged are the british pound  canadian dollar and euro 
we employ established policies and procedures governing the use of financial instruments to manage our exposure to such risks 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
we utilize a value at risk var model to determine the maximum potential loss in fair value from changes in market conditions 
the var model utilizes a variance co variance approach and assumes normal market conditions  a confidence level and a one day holding period 
the model includes all of our debt and all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts 
the model excludes anticipated transactions  firm commitments  and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by us  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
during and  our maximum potential one day loss in fair value of our exposure to foreign exchange rates and interest rates  using the variance co variance technique described above  was not material
