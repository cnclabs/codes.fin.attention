critical accounting policies and significant estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that it believes are reasonable based on information available 
these 
table of contents estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include sales allowances  recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  recoverability of royalty advances and commitments  pension costs and obligations  stock based compensation  and income taxes 
sales allowances sales allowances for customer promotions  discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue when the related revenue is recognized 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon passing of title to the customer  generally at the time of shipment 
revenue from product sales  less related sales allowances  is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company routinely commits to promotional sales allowance programs with customers 
these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs  which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year 
discounts are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale 
while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts  certain of the allowances  such as the returns allowance  are based on market data  historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation 
for its allowance programs that are not fixed  such as returns  the company estimates these amounts using a combination of historical experience and current market conditions 
these estimates are reviewed periodically against actual results and any adjustments are recorded at that time as an increase or decrease to net revenues 
during  there have been no material adjustments to the company s estimates 
recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually 
if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  the company will perform an interim test at that time 
the impairment test begins by allocating goodwill and intangible assets to applicable reporting units 
goodwill is then tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach  which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value which is also calculated using an income approach 
the company s annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of and no impairment was indicated 
the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the estimation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
at december   the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of  recorded on the balance sheet 
intangible assets  other than those with indefinite lives  are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the value of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets were considered to be impaired  the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated future discounted cash flows 
the estimation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the estimation of discounted cash flows also 
table of contents requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
intangible assets covered under this policy were  at december  during  there were no impairment charges related to these intangible assets 
recoverability of royalty advances and commitments the recoverability of royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product 
if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or  if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments  a charge to royalty expense to write off the remaining minimum guaranty is required 
the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties 
at december   the company had  of prepaid royalties   of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and  which are included in other assets 
pension costs and obligations the company  except for certain international subsidiaries  has pension plans covering substantially all of its full time employees 
pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets  expected compensation increases  and applicable discount rates 
the estimates for the company s us plans are established at the company s measurement date 
prior to  the company used september as its measurement date to measure the liabilities and assets of the plans and to establish the expense for the upcoming year 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  sfas no 
which the company adopted in december of  the company changed its measurement date in to its fiscal year end date 
in accordance with this  the liabilities and assets of the plans were remeasured as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the impact of this remeasurement 
the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan  the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes  and the current economic environment 
based on this information  the company s estimate of expected return on us plan assets was in  and a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense  while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense 
a decrease of in the estimate of expected return on plan assets would have increased pension expense for us plans by approximately expected compensation increases are estimated using a combination of historical and expected compensation increases 
based on this analysis  the company s estimate of expected long term compensation increases for its us plans was in  and increases in estimated compensation increases would result in higher pension expense while decreases would lower pension expense 
discount rates are selected based upon rates of return at the measurement date on high quality corporate bond investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
based on this long term corporate bond yield at december   the company s measurement date for its pension assets and liabilities  the company s discount rate for its us plans used for the calculation of pension expense averaged compared to a rate of used in the calculation of pension expense and used in the calculation of pension expense 
a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense 
a decrease of in the company s discount rate would have increased pension expense and the projected benefit obligation by approximately and  respectively 

table of contents in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and  if outside a certain corridor  amortized over future periods and  therefore generally affect recognized expense in future periods 
at december   the company s us plans had unrecognized actuarial losses of  included in accumulated other comprehensive income related to its defined benefit pension plans 
pension plan assets are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date 
changes in the fair market value of plan assets may impact the amount of future pension expense 
during there were not significant declines in the fair value of pension plan assets

under this plan  the company may grant stock options at or above the fair market value of the company s stock  as well as restricted stock  restricted stock units and contingent stock performance awards 
on december   the first day of fiscal  the company adopted sfas r  which requires the company to measure all stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model to value stock options that are granted under these plans 
the black scholes method includes four significant assumptions expected term of the options  risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  and expected stock price volatility 
for the company s and stock option grants  the weighted average expected term was approximately years 
this amount is based on a review of employees exercise history relating to stock options as well as the contractual term of the option 
the weighted average risk free interest rates used for and stock option grants were and  respectively 
this estimate was based on the interest rate available on us treasury securities with durations that approximate the expected term of the option 
the weighted average expected dividend yields used for the and stock option grants were and  respectively  which is based on the company s current annual dividend amount divided by the stock price on the date of the grant 
the weighted average expected stock price volatilities used for and stock option grants were and  respectively 
these amounts were derived using a combination of current and historical implied price volatility 
implied price volatility represents the volatility implied in publicly traded options on the company s stock  which the company believes represents the expected future volatility of the company s stock price 
the company believes that since this is a market based estimate  it provides a better estimate of expected future volatility as compared to based only on historical volatility 
in and  as part of its employee stock based compensation plan  the company issued contingent stock performance awards  which provide the recipients with the ability to earn shares of the company s common stock based on the company s achievement of stated cumulative diluted earnings per share and cumulative net revenue targets over the three fiscal years ended december for the award  and over a ten quarter period beginning july  and ending december for the award 
each award has a target number of shares of common stock associated with such award which may be earned by the recipient if the company achieves the stated diluted earnings per share and net revenue targets 
these awards are valued based on the fair market value of the company s stock on the date of the grant 
the measurement of the expense related to this award is based on the company s current estimate of revenues and diluted earnings per share over the performance period 
changes in these estimates may impact the expense recognized related to these awards 
income taxes the company s annual tax rate is based on its income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment and estimates are required to determine the company s annual tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions 
despite the company s belief that its tax return positions are fully supportable  these positions are subject to challenge and estimated liabilities 
table of contents are established in the event that these positions are challenged and the company is not successful in defending these challenges 
these estimated liabilities are adjusted  as well as the related interest  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
an estimated effective tax rate is applied to the company s quarterly operating results 
in the event there is a significant unusual or extraordinary item recognized in the company s quarterly operating results  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the time 
changes in the company s estimated effective tax rate during were primarily due to changes in its estimate of earnings by tax jurisdiction  as well as the company s decision to repatriate a portion of international earnings to the us in addition  changes in judgment related to tax positions taken in a prior fiscal year  or tax costs or benefits from a resolution of such positions would be recorded entirely in the interim period the judgment changes or resolution occurs 
during  the company recorded a total benefit of  related to discrete tax events primarily related to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits and related reversal of interest 
in certain cases  tax law requires items to be included in the company s tax returns at a different time than when these items are recognized on the financial statements or at a different amount than that which is recognized on the financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on the company s tax returns  while other differences are temporary and will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these differences that will reverse over time are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
deferred tax assets represent credits or deductions that have been reflected on the financial statements but have not yet been reflected in the company s income tax returns 
valuation allowances are established against deferred tax assets to the extent that it is determined that the company will have insufficient future taxable income  including capital gains  to fully realize the future credits  deductions or capital losses

results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar  hong kong dollar  euro  british pound  canadian dollar and mexican peso and  to a lesser extent  currencies in latin american and asia pacific countries 
to manage this exposure  the company has hedged a portion of its forecasted foreign currency transactions using foreign exchange forward contracts 
the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies could result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of these instruments 
a decrease in the fair value of these instruments would be substantially offset by decreases in the related forecasted foreign currency transaction 
the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short term borrowing positions in currencies other than the us dollar 
the company believes  however  that the on going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition 
in addition  the company s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates 
from time to time  affiliates of the company may make or receive intercompany loans in currencies other than their functional currency 
the company manages this exposure at the time the loan is made by using foreign exchange contracts

the interest rate swaps are matched with specific long term debt issues and are designated and effective as hedges of the change in the fair value of the associated debt 
changes in fair value of these contracts are wholly offset in earnings by changes in the fair value of the related long term debt 
at 
table of contents december   these contracts had a fair value of  which was included in other current assets  with a corresponding fair value adjustment to increase the current portion of long term debt 
changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the long term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps 
the company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this long term debt by approximately  or  respectively

the economy and inflation the principal market for the company s products is the retail sector 
revenues from the company s top customers  all retailers  accounted for approximately   and of its consolidated net revenues in  and  respectively 
in the past three years certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty 
the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 
the company s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year to be more significant to its overall business for the full year 
in  approximately of the company s full year net revenues were recognized in the second half of the year 
although the company expects that this concentration will continue  particularly as more of its business has shifted to larger customers with order patterns concentrated in the second half of the year  this concentration may be less in years where the company has products related to a major motion picture release that occurs in the first half of the year 
in  the company had products related to two major motion picture releases  spider man in may of and transformers in july of the concentration of sales in the second half of the year increases the risk of a underproduction of popular items  b overproduction of less popular items  and c failure to achieve tight and compressed shipping schedules 
the business of the company is characterized by customer order patterns which vary from year to year largely because of differences in the degree of consumer acceptance of a product line  product availability  marketing strategies  inventory levels  policies of retailers and differences in overall economic conditions 
the trend of larger retailers has been to maintain lower inventories throughout the year and purchase a greater percentage of product within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season  which includes christmas 
quick response inventory management practices being used by retailers result in more orders being placed for immediate delivery and fewer orders being placed well in advance of shipment 
retailers are timing their orders so that they are being filled by suppliers closer to the time of purchase by consumers 
to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated  their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed  thus negatively impacting the company s revenues 
in addition  the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company s significant retailers could negatively impact the company s future revenues 
the effect of inflation on the company s operations during was not significant and the company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices  accordingly
