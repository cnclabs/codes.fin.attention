item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations asset liability management 
growth strategy we expect to continue pursuing a growth strategy through a combination of internal growth  by selectively opening de novo branches throughout our markets in strategic locations  and by attracting employees and management teams who are not satisfied by working at larger organizations 
although a significant amount of our growth over the last several years has come through acquisition  we expect that our emphasis will be on organic growth over the next two to three years 
however  we will consider strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise 
our total assets have grown from million at december   to billion at december  during the years through  our acquisitions of fcib  access  nmfc  and front range have added approximately billion in total assets 
since  large out of state financial institutions have acquired several banks that compete with us 
these institutions concentrate on the mass retail customer base and extremely large customers 
they also tend to reduce service levels to small to medium size businesses 
these institutions method of doing business affords us a continuing opportunity to gain profitable new account relationships and to expand existing relationships by positioning ourselves as a local responsive alternative to the impersonal service of the larger banks 
we believe that there continue to be attractive opportunities to open new branches 
consolidation in the banking industry and increased regulatory burdens on existing institutions provide a favorable environment for such openings 
we consider a variety of criteria when evaluating potential branch expansion  including i the short and long term growth prospects for the location  ii the management and other resources required to integrate the operations  if desirable  iii the degree to which the branch would enhance our geographic diversification  iv the degree to which the branch would enhance our presence in an existing market  and v the costs of operating the branch 
our goal is to continue building a broad based  well capitalized  diversified  customer focused  regional financial institution while continuing to pursue the high growth strategy we have employed to date

supervision and regulation first state bancorporation 
we are a bank holding company subject to the supervision  examination  and regulation of the board of governors of the federal reserve system the federal reserve board under the bank holding company act the bhca 
the bhca and other federal laws subject bank holding companies to particular restrictions on the types of activities in which they may engage and to a range of supervisory requirements and activities  including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and regulations 
as a bank holding company  our activities and those of our banking subsidiary are limited to the business of banking and activities closely related or incidental to banking  and we may not directly or indirectly acquire the ownership or control of more than of any class of voting shares or substantially all of the assets of any company  including a bank  without the prior approval of the federal reserve board 
supervision and regulation of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries are intended primarily for the protection of depositors  the deposit insurance funds of the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic  and the banking system as a whole  not for the protection of bank holding company stockholders or creditors 
the banking agencies have broad enforcement power over bank holding companies and banks  including the power to impose substantial fines and other penalties for violation of laws and regulations 
on january   the federal reserve board s revised bank holding company rating system became effective 
the revised system more closely aligns the federal reserve s rating process with the focus of its current supervisory practices by placing an increased emphasis on risk management  providing a more flexible and comprehensive framework for evaluating financial condition  and requiring an explicit determination of the likelihood that the non depository entities of a bank holding company will have a significant negative impact on the depository subsidiaries 
under the revised rating system  each bank holding company is assigned a composite rating based on an evaluation and rating of three essential components of an institution s financial condition and operations 
these three components are risk management  financial condition  and potential impact of the parent company and non depository subsidiaries on the subsidiary depository institutions 
a fourth rating  depository institution  mirrors the primary regulator s assessment of the subsidiary depository institutions 

table of contents first community bank 
as a new mexico chartered state member bank of the federal reserve system  first community bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve board and the new mexico financial institutions division  and  as a result of the insurance of its deposits  by the fdic 
almost every aspect of the operations and financial condition of first community bank is subject to extensive regulation and supervision and to various requirements and restrictions under federal and state law  including requirements governing capital adequacy  liquidity  earnings  dividends  reserves against deposits  management practices  branching  loans  investments  and the provision of services 
various consumer protection laws and regulations also affect the operations of first community bank 
the deposits of first community bank are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic 
holding company liability 
under federal reserve board policy  a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial strength to its banking subsidiaries and commit resources to their support 
this support may be required by the federal reserve board at times when  absent this federal reserve policy  we may not be inclined to provide it 
as discussed below under prompt corrective action  a bank holding company in certain circumstances also could be required to guarantee the capital plan of an undercapitalized banking subsidiary 
in addition  any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its depository institution subsidiaries are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of the banks 
in the event of a bank holding company s bankruptcy under chapter of the us bankruptcy code  the trustee will be deemed to have assumed and is required to cure immediately any deficit under any commitment by the debtor holding company to any of the federal banking agencies to maintain the capital of an insured depository institution  and any claim for breach of such obligation will generally have priority over most other unsecured claims 
payment of dividends 
the federal reserve board has issued a policy statement with regard to the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies 
the policy statement provides that  as a matter of prudent banking  a bank holding company should not maintain a rate of cash dividends unless its net income available to common stockholders has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends  and the prospective rate of earnings retention appears to be consistent with the holding company s capital needs  asset quality  and overall financial condition 
accordingly  a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends that exceed its net income or can only be funded in ways that weaken the bank holding company s financial health  such as by borrowing 
in addition  as noted above  bank holding companies are expected under federal reserve board policy to serve as a source of financial strength for their depository institution subsidiaries 
this requirement  and the capital adequacy requirements applicable to bank holding companies  described below under capital adequacy requirements  may also limit our ability to pay dividends 
as a bank holding company  we are a legal entity separate and distinct from first community bank 
our principal asset is the outstanding capital stock of first community bank 
as a result  our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will depend primarily on the ability of first community bank to pay dividends to us in amounts in excess of the amounts required to service our obligations 
dividend payments from first community bank are subject to federal and state limitations  generally based on the capital level and current and retained earnings of the bank 
approval of the federal reserve board is required  for example  for payment of any dividend if the total of all dividends declared by the bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits as defined by regulatory agencies for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years 
first community bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its net profits 
first community bank is also prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized 
in addition  the federal regulatory agencies are authorized to prohibit a bank or bank holding company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
the payment of dividends could  depending on the financial condition of first community bank  be deemed to constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 

table of contents under new mexico law  first community bank may not pay a dividend on its common stock unless its remaining surplus after payment of such dividend is equal to at least of its minimum common capital requirement 
first community bank is also prohibited from paying dividends from undivided profits if its reserves against deposits are impaired or will become impaired as a result of such payment 
capital adequacy requirements 
we are subject to the federal reserve board s risk based capital and leverage guidelines for bank holding companies 
the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets  which are the credit risk equivalents of balance sheet assets and certain off balance sheet items such as standby letters of credit  is 
at least half of the total capital must be composed of common stockholders equity including retained earnings  trust preferred securities  qualifying non cumulative perpetual preferred stock and  for bank holding companies only  a limited amount of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock  and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill  other disallowed intangibles  and disallowed deferred tax assets  among other items tier capital 
the remainder may consist of a limited amount of subordinated debt  other perpetual preferred stock  hybrid capital instruments  mandatory convertible debt securities that meet certain requirements  as well as a limited amount of reserves for loan losses tier capital 
the maximum amount of tier capital that may be included in an organization s qualifying total capital is limited to of tier capital 
the federal reserve board has also adopted a minimum leverage ratio for bank holding companies  requiring tier capital of at least of average total consolidated assets 
our subsidiary  first community bank  also is subject to risk based and leverage capital guidelines of the federal reserve board which are similar to those established by the federal reserve board for bank holding companies 
as discussed below under enforcement powers of the federal regulatory agencies  failure to meet the minimum regulatory capital requirements could subject a banking institution to a variety of enforcement remedies available to federal regulatory authorities  including  in most severe cases  the termination of deposit insurance by the fdic and the placement of the institution into conservatorship or receivership 
the capital ratios for first state bancorporation and first community bank are provided in the chart below 
risk based capital and leverage ratios as of december  risk based ratios tier i capital total capital leverage ratio first state bancorporation first community bank minimum required ratio well capitalized minimum ratio the federal bank regulatory agencies risk based and leverage ratios are minimum supervisory ratios generally applicable to banking organizations that meet certain specified criteria  assuming that they have the highest regulatory rating 
banking organizations not meeting these criteria are expected to operate with capital positions well above the minimum ratios 
the federal bank regulatory agencies may set capital requirements for a particular banking organization that are higher than the minimum ratios when circumstances warrant 
federal reserve board guidelines also provide that banking organizations experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions will be expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels  without significant reliance on intangible assets 
in addition  the regulations of the federal reserve board provide that concentration of credit risk  interest rate risk  and certain risks arising from nontraditional activities  as well as an institution s ability to manage these risks  are important factors to be taken into account by regulatory agencies in assessing an organization s overall capital adequacy 
the risk based capital regulations also provide for the consideration of interest rate risk in the agencies determination of a banking institution s capital adequacy 
the regulations require such institutions to effectively measure and monitor their interest rate risk and to maintain capital adequate for that risk 

table of contents prompt corrective action 
under the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  the federal banking agencies must take prompt supervisory and regulatory actions against undercapitalized depository institutions 
depository institutions  such as first community bank  are assigned one of five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized and are subjected to differential regulation corresponding to the capital category within which the institution falls 
under certain circumstances  a well capitalized  adequately capitalized  or undercapitalized institution may be treated as if the institution were in the next lower capital category 
a depository institution is generally prohibited from making capital distributions including paying dividends or paying management fees to a holding company if the institution would thereafter be undercapitalized 
adequately capitalized institutions cannot accept  renew  or roll over brokered deposits except with a waiver from the fdic  and are subject to restrictions on the interest rates that can be paid on such deposits 
undercapitalized institutions may not accept  renew  or roll over brokered deposits 
the banking regulatory agencies are permitted or  in certain cases  required to take certain actions with respect to institutions falling within one of the three undercapitalized categories 
depending on the level of an institution s capital  the agencies corrective powers include  among other things prohibiting the payment of principal and interest on subordinated debt  prohibiting the holding company from making distributions without prior regulatory approval  placing limits on asset growth and restrictions on activities  placing additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates  restricting the interest rate the institution may pay on deposits  prohibiting the institution from accepting deposits from correspondent banks  and in the most severe cases  appointing a conservator or receiver for the institution 
a banking institution that is undercapitalized is required to submit a capital restoration plan  and such a plan will not be accepted unless  among other things  the banking institution s holding company guarantees the plan up to a certain specified amount 
any such guarantee from a depository institution s holding company is entitled to a priority of payment in bankruptcy 
failure to meet capital guidelines could subject the bank to a variety of enforcement remedies by federal bank regulatory agencies  including termination of deposit insurance by the fdic  and to certain restrictions on business 
as of december   both first state bancorporation and first community bank exceeded the required capital ratios for classification as well capitalized 
enforcement powers of the federal banking agencies 
the federal banking agencies have broad enforcement powers 
failure to comply with applicable laws  regulations  and supervisory agreements could subject first state bancorporation or first community bank  as well as officers  directors  and other institution affiliated parties of these organizations  to administrative sanctions and potentially substantial civil monetary penalties 
in addition to the grounds discussed under prompt corrective action  the appropriate federal banking agency may appoint the fdic as conservator or receiver for a banking institution or the fdic may appoint itself  under certain circumstances if any one or more of a number of circumstances exist  including  without limitation  where the banking institution is undercapitalized and has no reasonable prospect of becoming adequately capitalized  fails to become adequately capitalized when required to do so  fails to submit a timely and acceptable capital restoration plan  or materially fails to implement an accepted capital restoration plan 

table of contents control acquisitions 
the change in bank control act prohibits a person or group of persons from acquiring control of a bank holding company unless the federal reserve board has been notified and has not objected to the transaction 
under a rebuttable presumption established by the federal reserve board  the acquisition of or more of a class of voting stock of a bank holding company with a class of securities registered under section of the securities exchange act of  such as first state bancorporation  would  under the circumstances set forth in the presumption  constitute acquisition of control of first state bancorporation 
in addition  any company is required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve board under the bhca before acquiring in the case of an acquiror that is a bank holding company or more of the outstanding common stock of first state bancorporation  or otherwise obtaining control or a controlling influence over first state bancorporation

deposit insurance reform 
the deposits of first community bank are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic 
the federal deposit insurance reform act of made several changes in the structure of deposit insurance 
among these  the bank insurance fund and the savings association fund were merged into a new fund  the deposit insurance fund  effective march  the act also increases deposit coverage for certain retirement accounts and provides the fdic with greater flexibility in assessing insurance premiums on insured banks  including first community bank 
in november  the fdic adopted a new rule on the risk based assessment system to enable the fdic to more closely tie each bank s premiums to the risk it poses to the deposit insurance fund 
in addition  the fdic has new flexibility to manage the deposit insurance fund s reserve ratio within a range  which in turn will help 
table of contents prevent sharp swings in assessment rates that were possible under the design of the former system 
under the new risk based assessment system  the fdic evaluates each institution s risk based on three primary sources of information supervisory ratings for all insured institutions  financial ratios for most institutions  and long term debt issuer ratings for large institutions that have them 
as a result of the foregoing  the fdic set the assessment rates that took effect at the beginning of the new rates vary between five and seven cents for every of domestic deposits 
first community bank s current assessment rate is approximately six cents for every of domestic deposits 
first community bank s previous rate  which was adjusted quarterly  was cents for every of domestic deposits 
the new rulemaking also allowed eligible insured depository institutions to share a one time assessment credit pool of approximately billion  which offset the increase in premiums for a period of time 
first community bank s share of the one time credit was used up in the third quarter of future legislation 
various legislation is from time to time introduced in congress and state legislatures with respect to the regulation of financial institutions 
such legislation may change the banking statutes and our operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways

we make these forward looking statements in reliance on the safe harbor provisions provided under the private securities litigation reform act of all statements  other than statements of historical fact  included in this report which relate to performance  development or activities that we expect or anticipate will or may happen in the future  are forward looking statements 
the discussions regarding our growth strategy  expansion of operations in our markets  acquisitions  competition  loan and deposit growth  timing of new branch openings  and response to consolidation in the banking industry include forward looking statements 
other forward looking statements may be identified by the use of forward looking words such as believe  expect  may  might  will  should  seek  could  approximately  intend  plan  estimate  or anticipate or the negative of those words or other similar expressions 
forward looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties and are based on numerous assumptions 
they are not guarantees of future performance 
a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statement 
some factors include changes in interest rates  local business conditions  government regulations  loss of key personnel or inability to hire suitable personnel  faster or slower than anticipated growth  economic conditions  our 
table of contents competitors responses to our marketing strategy or new competitive conditions  and competition in the geographic and business areas in which we conduct our operations 
forward looking statements contained herein are made only as of the date made  and we do not undertake any obligation to update them to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
because forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  we caution that there are important factors  in addition to those listed above  that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
these factors include the following our profitability depends significantly on local and overall economic conditions 
our success is dependent to a significant extent upon local economic conditions in the communities we serve and the general economic conditions in the united states 
the economic conditions  including real estate values  in these areas and throughout the united states  have a significant impact on loan demand  the ability of borrowers to repay these loans  and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a decline in economic conditions  including a decline in real estate values  over a prolonged period of time in any of these areas could cause significant increases in nonperforming assets and could affect our ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral  which could cause decreased operating results  liquidity  and capital 
as of december   approximately of the book value of our loan portfolio consisted of loans collateralized by various types of real estate 
our loan portfolio is also concentrated in new mexico  colorado  utah  and arizona 
adverse economic conditions in these states could have a greater effect on our ability to attract deposits and result in high rates of loss and delinquency on our loan portfolio compared to competitors who may have more geographic diversification 
our small to medium sized business customers may have less financial resources with which to weather a downturn in the economy 
one of the primary focal points of our business development and marketing strategy is serving the banking and financial services needs of small to medium sized businesses 
small to medium sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities 
if general economic conditions become unfavorable in new mexico  colorado  utah  or arizona  the businesses of our customers and their ability to repay outstanding loans may be negatively affected 
as a consequence  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our profitability 
our net interest income may be reduced by changes in the interest rate environment 
our earnings depend to a significant extent on the interest rate differential 
the interest rate differential or spread is the difference between the interest earned on loans  securities  and other interest earning assets  and interest paid on deposits  borrowings  and other interest bearing liabilities 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities 
in particular  changes in the discount rate by the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve usually lead to changes in interest rates  which affect our interest income  interest expense  and securities portfolio 
net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans  and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations 
we cannot assure you that we can minimize our interest rate risk 
in addition  an increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread  asset quality  loan origination volume  and overall profitability 

table of contents in addition  our net income is affected by our interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity is the difference between our interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
interest rate sensitivity is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
during the last half of  the federal reserve lowered the discount rate three times for a total of  which negatively impacted our interest spread 
as of december   our interest sensitivity continues to be positive 
in january of  the federal reserve lowered the discount rate two additional times for a total of which will again negatively impact our interest spread 
if additional rate decreases occur  our results of operations and financial condition may be further adversely affected 
our loans are concentrated in new mexico  colorado  utah  and arizona and adverse conditions in those markets could adversely affect operations 
because our loans and deposits are in only a few concentrated geographic areas  our business may be more affected by local economic conditions and could be more vulnerable than banks whose lending and deposit activities are in larger  more geographically diversified markets 
a prolonged or more extreme downturn in the local economies in new mexico  colorado  utah  or arizona could have an adverse effect on business activity  employment  and collateral values  with a corresponding adverse effect on loan growth  income  and on borrowers abilities to repay loans 
our real estate construction loan portfolio may expose us to increased credit risk 
at december   our portfolio of real estate construction loans totaled million or of total loans 
approximately of these loans are related to residential construction and approximately are for commercial purposes or vacant land 
during  the housing markets declined  evidenced by excess lot inventory and higher levels of completed unsold housing inventory 
the decline in the housing market  sub prime loan crisis  and tightening of credit markets has led to higher than normal foreclosure rates on a national level 
while the four southwest states in which we operate have not experienced as significant a downturn in the residential real estate market as some parts of the country  these foreclosure rates have had a ripple affect on the construction industry as well as the acquisition and development sectors  exposing us to increased credit risk within our construction loan portfolio 
supervisory guidance on commercial real estate concentrations could restrict our activities and impose financial requirements or limitations on the conduct of our business 
the office of the comptroller of the currency  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  and the federal deposit insurance corporation have joint supervisory guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
the guidance is intended to help ensure that institutions pursuing a significant commercial real estate lending strategy remain healthy and profitable while continuing to serve the credit needs of their communities 
the agencies are concerned that rising commercial real estate loan concentrations may expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in commercial real estate markets 
the guidance reinforces and enhances existing regulations and guidelines for safe and sound real estate lending 
the guidance provides supervisory criteria  including numerical indicators to assist in identifying institutions with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny 
the guidance does not limit banks commercial real estate lending  but rather guides institutions in developing risk management practices and levels of capital that are commensurate with the level and nature of their commercial real estate concentrations 
the lending and risk management practices will be taken into account in supervisory evaluation of capital adequacy 
our commercial real estate portfolio as of december  meets the definition of commercial real estate concentration as set forth in the final guidelines 
if our risk management practices are found to be deficient  it could result in increased reserves and capital costs 

table of contents we operate in a highly regulated environment  changes in federal and state laws and regulations and accounting principles may adversely affect us 
we are a bank holding company 
bank holding companies and their subsidiaries operate in a highly regulated environment  subject to extensive supervision and examination by federal and state bank regulatory agencies 
we are subject to changes in federal and state law  as well as changes in regulation and governmental policies  income tax law  and accounting principles 
any change in applicable regulations  or federal or state legislation  or in accounting principles could have a significant impact on us and our results of operations 
additional legislation or regulations  including any that could be brought about by the current sub prime loan crisis  may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect our powers  authority  and operations 
if new legislation  regulations  or accounting principles are enacted or adopted  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
in particular  we are subject to the bank holding company act of  as amended  and to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve board 
first community bank  as a state member bank of the federal reserve system  is subject to regulation and supervision by the federal reserve board and the new mexico financial institutions division of the regulation and licensing department and  because its deposits are insured  by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
our operations in colorado  utah  and arizona may also be subject to regulation and supervision by the state of colorado division of banking  the utah department of financial institutions  and the arizona state banking department  respectively 
regulators have significant discretion and power to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws by banks and bank holding companies in the performance of the regulators supervisory and enforcement duties 
if regulators exercise these powers  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we currently qualify  and have elected with the federal reserve board  to be a financial holding company under the gramm leach bliley act 
financial holding companies may engage in a wider range of activities and may affiliate with a wider range of companies than may bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies 
if we were to engage in activities or affiliate with companies permissible only for financial holding companies  and we were to lose our status as a financial holding company  we could be required to cease those activities or divest those companies 
this could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we do not currently engage in activities  and are not currently affiliated with any companies  in reliance on our financial holding company status 
the federal reserve board has a policy stating that a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to a subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank 
under this doctrine  the federal reserve may require a bank holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bank holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if it fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank 
a capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may be required to borrow the funds or otherwise obtain the funds from external sources 
banking regulations may restrict our ability to pay dividends 
although we hold all of the outstanding capital stock of first community bank  we are a legal entity separate and distinct from first community bank 
our ability to pay dividends on our common stock will depend primarily on the ability of first community bank to pay dividends to us 
first community bank s ability to pay dividends and make other capital distributions to us is governed by federal and state law 
federal and state regulatory limitations on a bank s dividends generally are based on the bank s capital levels and current and retained earnings 
the earnings of first community bank may not be sufficient to make capital distributions to us in an amount sufficient for us to service our obligations or to pay dividends on our common stock 

table of contents first community bank is prohibited under federal law from paying any dividend that would cause it to become undercapitalized 
as of december   first community bank met the capital requirements of a well capitalized institution under applicable federal reserve board regulations 
we cannot assure you that the bank will remain well capitalized 
it is the policy of the federal reserve board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only out of income available from the past year and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition 
federal reserve board policy also provides that bank holding companies should not maintain such a level of cash dividends that would undermine the bank holding company s ability to provide financial resources as needed to its insured banking subsidiaries 
additionally  the federal reserve board has the right to object to a distribution on safety and soundness grounds 
depending upon the circumstances  the federal reserve board could take the position that paying a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
the terms of our trust preferred securities may restrict our ability to pay dividends 
if we suspend payments on our trust preferred securities  we will not be able to pay dividends to holders of our common stock 
the terms of our trust preferred securities allow us to suspend payments of interest  at our option  for up to five years 
we expect that similar provisions will exist in any future offerings of trust preferred securities 
however  if we exercise our option to suspend those payments  we will be prohibited from paying any dividends on any class of capital stock for as long as the trust preferred interest payments remain suspended 
we are currently paying interest on our trust preferred securities and have no plans to suspend those payments 
however  we cannot assure you that we will not suspend payments in the future 
defaults in the repayment of loans may negatively affect our business 
a borrower s default on its obligations under one or more of our loans may result in lost principal and interest income and increased operating expenses as a result of the allocation of management time and resources to the collection and work out of the loan 
in certain situations  where collection efforts are unsuccessful or acceptable work out arrangements cannot be reached  we may have to write off the loan in whole or in part 
in these situations  we may acquire real estate or other assets  if any  which secure the loan through foreclosure or other similar available remedies 
in these cases  the amount owed under the defaulted loan often exceeds the value of the assets acquired 
we regularly make a determination of an allowance for loan losses based on available information  including the quality of and trends in our loan portfolio  economic conditions  the value of the underlying collateral  historical charge offs  and the level of our non accruing loans 
provisions for this allowance result in an expense for the period 
if  as a result of general economic conditions or an increase in defaulted loans  we determine that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses are necessary  we may incur additional expenses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowances for loan losses and the values we attribute to real estate acquired through foreclosure or other similar remedies 
these regulatory agencies may require us to adjust our determination of the value for these items 
if we are required to adjust our allowances for loan losses  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
competition with other financial institutions could adversely affect our profitability 
the banking business is highly competitive  and our profitability depends upon our ability to compete in our market areas 
we compete with other commercial and savings banks and savings and loan associations 
we also compete with credit unions  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  brokerage and investment banking firms  asset based non bank lenders  and governmental organizations that may offer subsidized financing at lower rates than those we offer 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do 
although we have been able to compete effectively in the past  we may not be able to compete effectively in the future 
our large competitors may also in the future attempt to respond directly to our marketing strategy by emphasizing similar services 

table of contents environmental liability associated with commercial lending could result in losses 
in the course of our business  we may acquire through foreclosure properties securing loans that are in default 
particularly in commercial real estate lending  there is a risk that hazardous substances could be discovered on these properties 
in this event  under some circumstances we might be required to remove these substances from the affected properties at our sole cost and expense 
the cost of this removal could substantially exceed the value of the affected properties 
we may not have adequate remedies against the prior owner or other responsible parties  and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties 
if we experience these difficulties  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our success has been and continues to be largely dependent on the services of michael r 
stanford  our president and chief executive officer  h 
patrick dee  our executive vice president and treasurer  christopher c 
spencer  our senior vice president and chief financial officer  and other members of management who have significant relationships with our customers 
the prolonged unavailability or the unexpected loss of any of these officers could have an adverse effect on our growth and profitability 
our restated articles of incorporation  our bylaws  and new mexico law may delay or prevent an acquisition of us by a third party 
our restated articles of incorporation  our bylaws  and new mexico law contain provisions that make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions also could discourage proxy contests and may make it more difficult for you and other shareholders to elect your own representatives as directors and take other corporate actions 
our restated articles of incorporation do not permit cumulative voting of shareholders in the election of directors 
as a result  the holders of a majority of our outstanding shares control the election of all our directors 
we currently have a staggered board  which means that only one third of our board can be replaced by shareholders at any annual meeting 
directors may not be removed without cause except with the affirmative vote of at least two thirds of our shareholders 
the board of directors of first state bancorporation has approved an amendment to the company s articles of incorporation to provide for annual elections and abolish the staggered board structure which will be presented to the shareholders for vote at the annual meeting 
if our shareholders pass the amendment  directors will be elected to hold office until the next annual meeting commencing with the annual meeting in those directors elected in and prior years will serve their staggered terms 
our restated articles of incorporation also prohibit business combinations with a person who acquires or more of any class of our equity securities  including our common stock  unless the acquiror receives prior approval for the business combination from at least of the votes entitled to vote at a meeting of our shareholders held to vote on the proposed business combination 
this provision in our restated articles of incorporation is in addition to the limitations that new mexico law provides that may discourage potential acquirors from purchasing shares of our common stock 
under new mexico law  our directors may consider the interest of persons other than our shareholders when faced with unsolicited offers for control of us 
for example  our directors may consider the interest of our employees  suppliers  creditors  the communities we serve  and the state of new mexico generally in evaluating any change of control offer 
these and other provisions of new mexico law and our governing documents may have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interest of our shareholders 

table of contents we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions 
the success of acquisitions depends  in part  on our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities  economies of scale  and other benefits from combining of operations into ours 
to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions  our management team must develop strategies and implement business plans that will successfully combine the businesses 
if we do not realize economies of scale and other anticipated benefits as a result of acquisitions  the value of our common stock may decline 
an extended disruption of our vital infrastructure could negatively impact our operations  results  and financial condition 
our operations depend upon  among other things  our infrastructure  including equipment  information and telecommunications technologies  and facilities 
an extended disruption of vital infrastructure by fire  power loss  computer hacking or viruses  terrorist activity  natural disaster  telecommunications failure  or other events beyond our control could impact the financial services industry as a whole and our business 
our business recovery plan may not work as intended or may not prevent significant interruptions of our operations 
rapid technological changes may adversely affect the value of our current or future technologies to us and our customers  which could cause us to increase expenditures to upgrade and protect our technology or develop and protect competing technologies for delivering our services 
technology in our industry is evolving rapidly 
our ability to compete and our future results depend in part on our ability to make timely and cost effective enhancements and additions to our technology  to introduce new products and services that meet customer demands  and to keep pace with rapid advancements in technology 
maintaining flexibility to respond to technological and market dynamics may require substantial expenditures and lead time 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify and develop new products or services in a timely manner  that offerings  technologies  or services developed by others will not render our offerings obsolete or noncompetitive  or that the technologies in which we focus our investments will achieve acceptance in the marketplace and provide a return on our investment 
material breaches of our systems may have a significant effect on our business 
we collect  process  and store sensitive consumer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both us and third party service providers 
we have security  backup and recovery systems in place  as well as a business continuity plan to ensure the system will not be inoperable 
we also have security to prevent unauthorized access to the system 
in addition  we require our third party service providers to maintain similar controls 
however  we cannot be certain that the measures will be successful 
a security breach in the system and loss of confidential information such as credit card numbers and related information could result in losing the customers confidence and thus the loss of their business
