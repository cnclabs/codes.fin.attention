item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a growing independent oil and gas company engaged in acquisition  development and exploration activities in the us gulf coast region 
we are the largest oil and natural gas producer in mississippi  own the largest carbon dioxide co reserves east of the mississippi river used for tertiary oil recovery  and hold significant operating acreage in the barnett shale play near fort worth  texas  onshore louisiana and alabama  and properties in southeast texas 
our goal is to increase the value of acquired properties through a combination of exploitation  drilling  and proven engineering extraction processes  including secondary and tertiary recovery operations 
our corporate headquarters are in plano  texas a suburb of dallas  and we have four primary field offices located in laurel  mississippi  mccomb  mississippi  brandon  mississippi  and cleburne  texas 
overview operating results 
during  we set a corporate record for annual cash flow from operations of million  a increase over the million of cash flow from operations generated during our net income of million was higher than our million of net income during  even after including a million decrease in pre tax income between the respective periods from non cash fair value adjustments associated with our commodity derivative contracts 
record high production levels  higher oil prices  and million of incremental net cash receipts on our derivative contracts contributed to the positive results  partially offset by higher overall expenses  lower natural gas prices  and the effect of the million differential in non cash fair value adjustments associated with our commodity derivative contracts see results of operations oil and natural gas revenues 
our fourth quarter average production rate of  boe d and our average production of  boe d were company quarterly and annual production records  with significant increases in our tertiary oil and barnett shale production  partially offset by production declines in our louisiana onshore properties 
higher oil prices further improved results  as our average realized per boe commodity price was higher than during  resulting in higher revenues in  together with higher revenues due to higher production levels 
excluding any impact of our commodity derivative income and expense items  our aggregate expenses increased during as compared to expenses during due to i higher overall industry costs  ii a higher percentage of operations related to tertiary operations  which generally have higher operating costs per boe see results of operations co operations for a more thorough discussion  iii higher average debt levels to finance our million acquisition on march  see acquisitions below and continued spending in excess of cash flow from operations see capital resources and liquidity  and iv higher compensation expense resulting from additional employees and increased salaries which we consider necessary in order to remain competitive in the industry  partially offset by approximately million of non recurring charges to earnings in related to the departure and retirement of two vice presidents 
as has been our practice for several years  we are reinvesting virtually all of our cash flow in new projects  with a desire to further increase our production and reserves 
during  our proved reserves increased from mmboe as of december   to mmboe as of december   replacing approximately of our production  almost entirely from organic growth 
the most significant reserve additions during were in the barnett shale mmboe and in our tertiary operations mmboe 
while we booked more proved tertiary reserves in than in mmboe  these reserve quantity additions were less than we expect to recognize during the next few years  presuming we have a production response from the tertiary floods we started in and expect to start in and see results of operations depletion  depreciation and amortization for a review of our reserve changes during and a discussion of our proved tertiary reserves 
while overall costs were higher in the periods than in the comparable periods  during the rate of inflation in our industry appears to have moderated  and in some cases  we are beginning to see modest cost reductions 
likewise  although oilfield goods and services are still in tight supply  there have been signs of improvement in overall availability  but some supply issues persist  including long lead times for certain goods and services  such as compressors used in our tertiary recycling facilities and construction services for pipelines 
it is difficult to forecast price trends and supply and service availability  which if adverse  can significantly impact both operating costs and capital expenditures  as well as cause delays in achieving our anticipated production targets

having enough co 

to flood our tertiary oil fields is one of the most important ingredients  if not the key ingredient  to our tertiary operations

resources for further information 
oil production from our tertiary operations increased to an average of  boe d in  a increase over tertiary production level of  boe d  with fourth quarter tertiary production averaging  boe d 
production from our phase ii operations in eastern mississippi soso  eucutta and martinville fields contributed  boe d approximately to the increase over the prior year s tertiary production level  with the balance of the increase coming from our phase i fields  except for little creek field which is on a gradual decline 
in addition to further development of oil fields we already own and which are slated for tertiary flooding  we are continuing to buy additional oil fields that are candidates for future tertiary flood activity see acquisitions below 
please refer to the section entitled co operations below for a discussion of these operations  their potential  and the ramifications of our continuing emphasis on these operations 
sale of louisiana natural gas assets 
in october  we entered into an agreement to sell our louisiana natural gas assets to a privately held company for approximately million before closing adjustments plus any amounts received in the future from a net profits interest in a well 
in late december  we closed on approximately of that sale with net proceeds of approximately million including estimated final purchase price adjustments  and closed on the remaining on february   with net proceeds at the second closing of approximately million 
the operating net revenue  net of capital expenditures  between the august   effective date and the respective closing dates was an adjustment to the purchase price  along with other minor closing adjustments 
the potential net profits interest relates to a well in the south chauvin field and is only earned if operating income from that well exceeds certain levels  which we believe could potentially increase the ultimate sales price by up to production attributable to the sold properties averaged approximately mmcfe d natural gas during the fourth quarter of  representing approximately of our total fourth quarter production and approximately of our total proved reserve quantities as of december  genesis transactions 
on july   genesis energy  lp genesis  a master limited partnership of which denbury is the general partner  closed on a previously announced acquisition in which they acquired several energy related businesses from the davison family of ruston  louisiana  for total consideration of approximately million net of cash acquired at closing and subject to final purchase price adjustments 
the acquisition agreement provided that genesis deliver million of consideration  half in common units at an agreed value of per unit as compared to a value of per unit for accounting purposes and half in cash  subject to specified purchase price adjustments 
in conjunction with that acquisition  we exercised our right to maintain our pro rata ownership of common units  acquiring  additional common units for approximately million  in addition to our capital contribution of an additional million as general partner to maintain our general partner s interest 
in order to maintain our pro rata common unit ownership interest in genesis  we acquired an additional  common units in a december genesis public offering at per unit  the public offering price of per unit  less the underwriting discount 
our total cost for the units  including the general partner portion of the offering  was million 
the company has reached substantial agreement and is in the process of finalizing the business issues with genesis and its lenders as to the terms of the transactions with genesis involving the company s nejd and free state co pipelines  including a long term transportation service arrangement for the free state line and a year financing lease for the nejd system 
in these transactions  denbury expects to receive from genesis million in cash and million of genesis common limited partnership units at the average closing price of the units on the thirty days prior to closing 
the company anticipates capitalizing these transactions for accounting purposes and currently projects that it will initially pay genesis approximately million per annum under the financing lease and transportation services agreement and a lesser pro rated amount for  with future payments for the nejd pipeline payments fixed at million per year during the term of the financing lease  and the payments relating to 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the free state pipeline dependant on the volumes of co transported therein 
while the business terms of the transactions have been substantially completed  closing remains subject to finalization of legal issues and completion and delivery of closing documentation 
currently  we will also consider similar transactions with genesis for the new co pipeline we have constructed from jackson dome to tinsley field and are constructing from tinsley field to delhi field the delta pipeline  once that pipeline is completed  forecasted at this time to be completed in late or early  or potentially we could divide that pipeline into two segments and two separate transactions 
if in future periods genesis is able to complete additional acquisitions of non denbury related assets of sufficient size and with acceptable returns  we would consider additional dropdowns with genesis of certain of our existing or planned assets provided that such transactions can generate qualified income for a master limited partnership  which may depend in part on the degree to which we ship man made co on such lines and the status of man made co as qualified income 
acquisitions 
on march   we completed an acquisition of six producing oil and natural gas fields  two of which are future potential co tertiary oil flood candidates  collectively called the seabreeze complex  located near houston  texas  at a cost of approximately million 
tertiary operations are not expected to commence at these fields until or  following anticipated completion of the mile co pipeline from louisiana to hastings field also near houston 
the acquisition was funded with bank financing under our existing credit facility 
at the time of acquisition  these fields had estimated proved conventional reserves of approximately mboe and produced an average of boe d during the fourth quarter of we operate all of these fields and own the majority of the working interests 
we also purchased east and south gillock fields in  small future co tertiary oil flood candidates  also located near houston  texas  at a cost of approximately million 
the conventional reserves and production associated with these fields was negligible at the time of the acquisition 
april debt issuance 
on april   we issued million of senior subordinated notes due as an additional issuance under our existing indenture governing our december sale of million of senior subordinated notes due the notes were issued at of par  which equates to an effective yield to maturity of 
the net proceeds from the issuance were approximately million  which we used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under our bank credit facility 
capital resources and liquidity our current capital exploration and development budget is approximately million  excluding any potential acquisitions 
the current program includes an estimated million to acquire pipe and right of ways for our proposed co pipeline from louisiana to texas the green pipeline and another million for the segment of the delta co pipeline from tinsley to delhi fields 
we expect to spend an additional million constructing the green pipeline during  making our current anticipated total cost for that line approximately million 
currently  over of the remaining portion of our budget is expected to be spent on other tertiary related operations  over in the barnett shale area  and the balance in other areas 
based on oil and natural gas commodity futures prices as of late february and our current production forecasts  our capital budget is forecasted to be million to million greater than our anticipated cash flow from operations 
we plan to fund most of this deficit with cash generated by the anticipated drop down transaction with genesis see overview genesis transactions and our recently completed sale of louisiana natural gas assets see overview sale of louisiana natural gas assets 
we could potentially also generate additional funds of up to million through transactions with genesis whereby we could drop down our delta co pipeline  or portions thereof  to genesis see overview genesis transactions 
if the delta pipeline drop down to genesis is not consummated  or if there is still a shortfall in excess of the cash generated by our recently completed louisiana property sale and proposed drop down of pipelines to genesis described above  we would likely fund the deficit with bank debt 
in addition  if commodity prices were to significantly decrease from current levels  we could also reduce our capital spending during commensurately  in addition to using bank debt to fund the deficit 
as of february   we had million of bank debt outstanding on a million borrowing base  leaving us significant incremental borrowing capacity  more than we currently plan or desire to use 
further  we believe that we could significantly increase our bank borrowing base if desired  and anticipate increasing it at our april  redetermination 

table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we monitor our capital expenditures on a regular basis  adjusting them up or down depending on commodity prices and the resultant cash flow 
therefore  during the last few years as commodity prices have increased  we have increased our capital budget throughout the year 
as a result of cost inflation in our industry in recent years  many of our recent year budget increases have related to escalating costs rather than additional projects 
even though there are signs that the rate of this inflationary trend is subsiding  if costs do rise or we spend more than our estimated amounts  we will either have to increase our capital budget or consider deferring a portion of our planned projects 
we continue to pursue additional acquisitions of mature oil fields that we believe have potential as future tertiary flood candidates 
these possible acquisitions are difficult to forecast and the purchase price can vary widely depending on the levels of existing production  conventional proved reserves and commodity prices 
any additional acquisitions would be funded  at least temporarily  with bank or other debt  although if significant  the acquisition would likely be ultimately funded with more permanent capital such as subordinated debt and or additional equity 
amendment to our bank credit facility 
on march   we amended our sixth amended and restated credit agreement with our nine banks  led by jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent 
the amendment i increased the commitment amount that the banks are committed to fund from million to million  ii reconfirmed the borrowing base of million  iii authorized last spring s million subordinated debt offering see overview april debt issuance  and iv authorized us to enter into a sale leaseback type transaction for our co pipelines  not to exceed million  with genesis  in the type of transaction contemplated and discussed above see overview genesis transactions 
with regard to our bank credit facility  the borrowing base represents the amount that can be borrowed from a credit standpoint based on our assets  as confirmed by the banks  while the commitment amount is the amount the banks have committed to fund pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement 
the banks have the option to participate in any borrowing request by us in excess of the commitment amount million  up to the borrowing base limit million  although the banks are not obligated to fund any amount in excess of the commitment amount

as is common in our industry  we commit to make certain expenditures on a regular basis as part of our ongoing development and exploration program 
these commitments generally relate to projects that occur during the subsequent several months and are usually part of our normal operating expenses or part of our capital budget  which for is currently set at million 
in certain cases we have the ability to terminate contracts for equipment in which case we would only be liable for the cost incurred by the vendor up to that point  however  as we currently do not anticipate cancelling those contracts these amounts include our estimated payments under those contracts 
we also have recurring expenditures for such things as accounting  engineering and legal fees  software maintenance  subscriptions  and other overhead type items 
normally these expenditures do not change materially on an aggregate basis from year to year and are part of our general and administrative expenses

during november we entered into an agreement that gives us an option on september   and september   to be effective on the following january st  to purchase an interest in hastings field  a strategically significant potential tertiary flood candidate located near houston  texas

as consideration for the option agreement  to date we have paid million under this option and have a remaining payment due in november of million 
we can extend the option period beyond november for up to seven additional years at an incremental cost of million per year 
none of the option payment amounts will be credited against the purchase price if we exercise the option 
if we exercise the option  we will be committed to make aggregate net capital expenditures in the field totaling approximately million over the subsequent five years to develop the field for tertiary operations  with an obligation to commence co injections in the field within three years following the option exercise 
the above table does not include the commitments related to hastings field if the purchase option is exercised by us  as the obligation is at our option 
the above table does include the remaining million due on the hastings option payment 
long term contracts require us to deliver co to our industrial co customers at various contracted prices  plus we have a co delivery obligation to genesis pursuant to three volumetric production payments vpp entered into during through based upon the maximum amounts deliverable as stated in the industrial contracts and the volumetric production payments  we estimate that we may be obligated to deliver up to bcf of co to these customers over the next years  however  since the group as a whole has historically taken less co than the maximum allowed in their contracts  based on the current level of deliveries  we project that our commitment would likely be reduced to approximately bcf 
the maximum volume required in any given year is approximately mmcf d  although based on our current level of deliveries this would likely be reduced to approximately mmcf d 
given the size of our proven co reserves at december  approximately tcf before deducting approximately bcf for the three vpps  our current production capabilities and our projected levels of co usage for our own tertiary flooding program  we believe that we will be able to meet these delivery obligations 
results of operations co operations overview 
since we acquired our first carbon dioxide tertiary flood in mississippi in  our interest in tertiary operations has increased to the point that approximately of our current capital budget is dedicated to tertiary related operations 
we particularly like this play as i it has a lower risk and is more predictable than most traditional exploration and development activities  ii it provides a reasonable rate of return at relatively low oil prices generally around a barrel at today s cost levels  depending on the specific field and area  and iii we have virtually no competition for this type of activity in our geographic area 
generally  from east texas to florida  there are no known significant natural sources of co except our own  and these large volumes of co 

that we own drive the play 
we talk about our tertiary operations by labeling operating areas or groups of fields as phases 
phase i is in southwest mississippi and includes several fields along our mile nejd co pipeline that we acquired in the most significant fields in this area are little creek  mallalieu  mccomb and brookhaven 
phase ii  which began with the early completion of the free state co pipeline to east mississippi  includes eucutta  soso  martinville and heidelberg fields 
tinsley field located northwest of jackson  mississippi  acquired in january  is our phase iii and is serviced by that portion of the delta co pipeline completed in january phase iv includes cranfield and lake st 
john fields  two fields near the mississippi louisiana border located west of the phase i fields  and phase v is delhi field  a louisiana field we acquired in  located southwest of tinsley field 
flooding in phase v will begin in upon completion of the delta co pipeline from tinsley to delhi 
citronelle field in southwest alabama  another field acquired in  is our phase vi which will require an extension to the free state co pipeline  the timing of which is uncertain at this time 
our last two currently existing phases will require completion of our proposed green pipeline  a mile co 

pipeline which will run from southern louisiana to near houston  texas  and is scheduled for completion in late or hastings field  a field on which we acquired a purchase option in late see commitments and contingencies  is our phase vii  and the seabreeze complex  acquired in  will be our phase viii see overview acquisitions 
co 

resources 
since we acquired the co source field located near jackson  mississippi  in  we have continued to develop the field and have increased the proven co 

reserves from approximately bcf at the time 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of the acquisition to approximately tcf as of december  during  our proven co reserves increased approximately  or bcf excluding production 
the estimate of tcf of proved co reserves is based on ownership of the co reserves  of which denbury s net revenue interest ownership is approximately tcf 
both reserve estimates are included in the evaluation of proven co reserves prepared by degolyer and macnaughton 
in discussing the available co reserves  we make reference to the gross amount of proved reserves  as this is the amount that is available for denbury s tertiary recovery programs  genesis  and industrial users  as denbury is responsible for distributing the entire co production stream for both of these uses 
we currently estimate that it will take approximately tcf of co to develop and produce the proved tertiary recovery reserves we have recorded at december   in phases i and ii 
today  we own every known producing co well in the region  providing us a significant strategic advantage in the acquisition of other properties in mississippi and louisiana that could be further exploited through tertiary recovery 
as of february   we estimate that we are capable of producing approximately mmcf d of co  over six times the rate that we were capable of producing at the time of our initial acquisition in we continue to drill additional co wells  with five more wells planned for  in order to further increase our production capacity and potentially increase our proven co reserves 
our drilling activity at jackson dome will continue beyond as our current forecasts for the existing eight phases suggest that we will need approximately bcf d of co production by in addition to using co for our tertiary operations  we sell co to third party industrial users under long term contracts 
most of these industrial contracts have been sold to genesis along with the sale of a volumetric production payment for the co our average daily co production during  and was approximately million  million and million cubic feet per day  respectively  of which approximately in  in and in was used in our tertiary recovery operations  with the balance delivered to genesis under the volumetric production payments or sold to third party industrial users 
we spent approximately per mcf in operating expenses to produce our co 

during  more than our average of per mcf and our average of per mcf  with the higher costs each year primarily due to higher oil costs  which impacts the amount we pay royalty owners for the co  and higher operating costs 
our estimated total cost per thousand cubic feet of co during was approximately  after inclusion of depreciation and amortization expense related to the co production  as compared to approximately during and during man made co sources 
in addition to our natural source of co  we are in discussions with the owners of several possible gasification plants which  if built  will convert coal or petroleum coke into various other fuels  with co being a significant by product of the process 
we expect these plants to provide us with significant additional sources of co in the future which would enable us to further expand our tertiary operations  although the earliest source of this manufactured co is not expected to be available to us until late or we have entered into long term commitments to purchase manufactured co from three proposed plants see commitments and obligations  which  if all three plants are built  are currently anticipated to provide us with an aggregate of mmcf d to mmcf d of co 

by while we are uncertain as to whether these three specific plants will be built  we anticipate that some gasification plants will be built within the next several years 
if correct in our assumptions  we believe that we are a likely purchaser of co produced from such plants built in our area of operations because of the scale of our tertiary operations  the co pipeline infrastructure that we are continuing to develop  and the large natural source of co jackson dome  which can act as a swing co producer if needed 
overview of tertiary economics 
when we began our tertiary operations several years ago  they were generally economic at oil prices below per bbl  although the economics varied by field 
our costs have escalated during the last few years due to general cost inflation in the industry  raising our current economic oil price to around per bbl  again dependent on the specific field 
our inception to date finding and development costs including future development and abandonment costs but excluding expenditures on fields without proven reserves for our tertiary oil fields through december   are approximately per boe 
currently  we forecast that these costs will range from to per boe over the life of each field  depending on the state of a particular field at the time we begin operations  the amount of potential oil  the proximity to a pipeline or other facilities  etc 
our operating costs for tertiary operations are expected to range from to per boe over the life of each field at today s prices  again depending on the field itself 

table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations while these economic factors have wide ranges  our rate of return from these operations has generally been better than our rate of return on traditional oil and gas operations  and thus our tertiary operations have become our single most important focus area 
while it is extremely difficult to accurately forecast future production  we do believe that our tertiary recovery operations provide significant long term production growth potential at reasonable rates of return  with relatively low risk  and thus will be the backbone of our company s growth for the foreseeable future 
although we believe that our plans and projections are reasonable and achievable  there could be delays or unforeseen problems in the future that could delay or affect the economics of our overall tertiary development program 
we believe that such delays or price effects  if any  should only be temporary 
financial statement impact of co operations 
our increasing emphasis on co tertiary recovery projects has significantly impacted and will continue to impact our financial results and certain operating statistics 
first  there is a significant delay between the initial capital expenditures on these fields and the resulting production increases  as we must build facilities before co flooding can commence  and it usually takes six to months before the field responds to the injection of co co  oil production commences 
further  we may spend significant amounts of capital before we can recognize any proven reserves from fields we flood see analysis of co tertiary recovery operating activities below 
even after a field has proven reserves  there will usually be significant amounts of additional capital required to fully develop the field 
second  these tertiary projects are usually more expensive to operate than our other oil fields because of the cost of injecting and recycling the co primarily due to the significant energy requirements to re compress the co back into a near liquid state for re injection purposes 
as commodity and energy prices increase  so do our operating expenses in these fields 
most of our co operating expenses are allocated to our oil fields and recorded as lease operating expenses on those fields at the time the co is injected 
since we expense all of the operating costs to produce and inject our co  the operating costs per barrel will be higher at the inception of co injection projects because of little or minimal related oil production at that time 
commencing in  we plan to capitalize the cost of co and related operating costs until production commences  which may slightly reduce our cost per boe see note to the consolidated financial statements  significant accounting policies tertiary injection costs 
our total corporate operating expenses on a per boe basis will likely continue to increase as these operations constitute an increasingly larger percentage of our operations 
generally  these higher operating costs are somewhat offset by lower finding and development costs which helps to lower our overall depreciation and depletion rate see also overview of tertiary economics above and analysis of co tertiary recovery operating activities below 
analysis of co tertiary recovery operating activities 
we currently have tertiary operations ongoing at almost all phase i fields  and soso  martinville and eucutta fields in phase ii  and we are currently injecting co 

at tinsley field in phase iii 
we project that our oil production from our co operations will increase substantially over the next several years as we continue to expand this program by adding additional projects and phases 
as of december   we had approximately mmbbls of proven oil reserves related to tertiary operations mmbbls in phase i and the balance in phase ii and have identified and estimate significant additional oil potential in other fields that we own in this region 
we added mmbbls of tertiary related proved oil reserves during  primarily initial proven tertiary oil reserves at soso and martinville fields phase ii 
prior to  we booked most of our proven tertiary oil reserves near the start of a project as almost all the oil fields in phase i were analogous to little creek field our first flood and thus it was not necessary to have an oil production response to the co injections before they were considered proven 
conversely  our new floods after phase i are not analogous for the most part  as the tertiary floods will be in different geological formations 
therefore  for these new phases  there must be an oil production response to the co injections before we can recognize proven oil reserves  even though we believe that these formations have a similar risk profile 
the magnitude of proven reserves that we can book in any given year will depend on our progress with new floods and the timing of the production response 
our average annual oil production from our co 

tertiary recovery activities has increased during the last few years  from  bbls d in to  bbls d during tertiary oil production represented approximately of our total corporate oil production during and approximately of our total corporate production of both oil and natural gas during the same period on a boe basis

we also lease a portion of our recycling and plant equipment used in our tertiary operations  which further increases operating expenses 
over the last five years we have leased certain equipment that qualifies for operating lease treatment representing an underlying aggregate cost of approximately million as of december  these leases have been an attractive method of financing due to their low imputed interest rates  which are fixed for seven to ten years 
also  the cost to produce our co

during  the most significant production increases were from the barnett shale and our acquisition of tinsley and citronelle fields in january  which contributed approximately  boe d of the increase  with  boe d attributable to the mississippi non co floods and  boe d to alabama fields  although a small portion of that increase was from our internal development efforts following the acquisition 
production in the mississippi non co floods area decreased slightly each year from the prior year before giving effect to the january acquisition related increase noted above  as this area is on a gradual decline from normal depletion  partially offset by drilling activity developing the selma chalk natural gas reservoir in the heidelberg area 
see co operations above for a discussion of the tertiary related production 
the general decrease in onshore louisiana production in is due primarily to the expected relatively rapid depletion of wells in this area as we have focused less of our spending and activity in this area than we have historically 
we closed on the divesture of these assets  excluding any oil fields that could have tertiary oil potential  in december and february see overview sale of louisiana natural gas assets 
the increase in production during in this area was a result of a higher level of activity during and early before the decision was made to sell the properties in this area 
our production in the barnett shale area during increased  boe d increase over our level  and during increased  boe d increase over our level  primarily as a result of higher drilling activity levels than in we drilled and completed wells during and wells during  as compared to wells drilled during  and plan to drill to wells during we had four rigs working in the area during most of the first quarter of  but in the second quarter reduced our rig count in this area to three  which we retained for the remainder of during the fourth quarter of  we processed our natural gas through a different gas plant  increasing the amount of liquids we recovered by  boe d  the primary reason for 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the increased production that quarter 
we believe that our fourth quarter of production has peaked  or is near its peak  from this area  based on the anticipated level of future drilling activity 
these wells are characterized by steep decline rates in their first year of production typically to  followed by a gradual leveling off of production and a resultant slow decline rate  giving them an overall long production life 
the texas property acquisition we made late in the first quarter of see overview acquisitions contributed approximately boe d to the average production from this area 
our production for was oil as compared to during and in  as the recent increases in natural gas production in the barnett shale area and fluctuating natural gas production in louisiana have generally been matched by increases in our tertiary oil production 
oil and natural gas revenues 
our oil and natural gas revenues have increased for each of the last two years  as both overall commodity prices and production were higher 
the increase in production in increased oil and natural gas revenues by million  or  while the increase in overall commodity prices increased revenues by million  or  over the prior year s levels 
the increase in production in increased oil and natural gas revenues by million  or  while the increase in overall commodity prices increased revenues by million  or  over the prior year s levels 
excluding any impact of our derivative contracts  our net realized commodity prices and nymex differentials were as follows during  and year ended december  net realized prices oil price per bbl gas price per mcf price per boe nymex differentials oil per bbl natural gas per mcf our oil nymex differential during was the lowest in our corporate history 
the improved nymex differential during was related to higher prices received for both our light sweet barrels and our sour barrels primarily as a result of nymex wti prices being depressed due to lack of available storage capacity in the mid continent area  an oversupply of crude from canada  capacity transportation issues in moving crude oil out of the cushing  oklahoma  area and unanticipated refinery outages 
this trend reversed itself by the fourth quarter of  with average nymex oil differentials during that quarter of per bbl  higher than our historical averages due to the significant increase in liquids extracted from our natural gas production in the barnett shale which is recorded as oil production  but sells at a significant discount to nymex see also results of operations production above 
our natural gas nymex differentials are generally caused by movement in the nymex natural gas prices during a month as most of our natural gas is sold on an index price that is set near the first of the month 
while the percentage change in the above table is quite large  these differentials are very seldom more than a dollar above or below the nymex amount

operating expenses 
our lease operating expenses have increased each year on both a per boe basis and in absolute dollars primarily as a result of i our increasing emphasis on tertiary operations see discussion of those expenses under co operations above  ii higher overall industry costs  iii increased personnel and related costs  iv higher fuel and energy costs to operate our properties  and v increasing lease payments for certain of our tertiary operating facilities and equipment 
during  operating costs averaged per boe  up from per boe during  and per boe in operating expenses for our tertiary operations were million in  up from million during  and million during  all as a result of increased tertiary activity 
tertiary operating expenses were particularly impacted by higher power and energy costs  higher costs for co  and payments on leased facilities and equipment see co operations above 
we expect this increase in tertiary operating costs to continue and to further increase our cost per boe as these costs become a more significant portion of our total production and operations 
further  the sale of our louisiana natural gas properties see overview sale of louisiana natural gas properties will further increase our corporate average operating cost per boe in the future 
if the sold properties were excluded from our operating results for the entire year of  our operating costs would have been approximately per boe  approximately per boe higher than as reported 
production taxes and marketing expenses generally change in proportion to commodity prices and therefore have been higher in each of the last three years along with the increasing commodity prices 
transportation and plant processing fees were approximately million higher in than in and approximately million higher in than in  largely associated with the incremental production and incremental plant processing fees related to our barnett shale production 
general and administrative expenses during the last three years  general and administrative g a expenses have increased on a gross basis  while fluctuating on a per boe basis as outlined below year ended december  net g a expense thousands gross g a expense state franchise taxes operator labor and overhead recovery charges capitalized exploration and development costs net g a expense average g a cost per boe employees as of december gross g a expenses increased million  or between and  and million  or  between and the increases are primarily due to higher compensation and personnel related costs caused by an increase in the number of employees  and higher wages as a result of average salary increases of between and during and  which we consider necessary in order to remain competitive in our industry 
during  we increased our employee count by  and we further increased our employee count during partially offsetting these overall compensation increases were million of non recurring charges related to the retirement and departure of two vice presidents during the adoption of sfas no

table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations increased gross g a expense by approximately million during  representing the non cash charge for stock compensation stock options and stock appreciation rights pertaining to personnel charged to g a 
stock compensation expense reflected in gross g a was million during  million during and million during higher operator overhead recovery charges resulting from incremental activity helped to partially offset the increase in gross g a 
our well operating agreements allow us  when we are the operator  to charge a well with a specified overhead rate during the drilling phase and also to charge a monthly fixed overhead rate for each producing well 
as a result of the additional operated wells from acquisitions  additional tertiary operations  increased drilling activity and increased compensation expense including the allocation of that portion of stock compensation charged to lease operating expense  the amount we recovered as operator labor and overhead charges increased by between and  and between and capitalized exploration and development costs increased each year primarily due to additional personnel and increased compensation costs  and the adoption of sfas no

these increases in cash interest have been partially offset by higher interest amounts capitalized on our significant unevaluated properties  primarily related to our acquisition  continued expansion of our tertiary operations and construction of our co pipelines 
the average interest rate has been relatively unchanged because our subordinated debt  which was of the total average debt  of the total average debt  and of the total average debt  is a fixed interest rate

we adjust our dd a rate each quarter for significant changes in our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves and costs  and thus our dd a rate could change significantly in the future

we added approximately mmboe and mmboe of reserves in the barnett shale and approximately mmboe and mmboe in our tertiary oil properties during and  respectively  and only minor amounts elsewhere 
further  as a result of rising industry costs  we not only exceeded our cost estimates on our projects over the last two years  but also increased our future development costs on our proved undeveloped reserves to reflect these rising costs 
in general  was a transition year for us with regard to recording proved tertiary oil reserves 
prior to  many of our tertiary floods could be considered proven near the start of a project as they were analogous to little creek field an already producing tertiary flood and thus it was not necessary to have a production response to co 

injections before we recognized proved reserves 
conversely  since that time  most of our new floods are not analogous and thus must have an oil production response to the co 

injections before we can recognize tertiary proved oil reserves in these fields  even though we believe there is a similar risk profile in flooding these fields 
during  two of our most significant new floods were soso and martinville fields phase ii  for which reserves were not booked until after we had a significant production response 
during  we initiated floods at lockhart crossing phase i  tinsley phase iii and cranfield phase iv that will not result in additional proved reserves until we have a production response  which is expected in we expect this same delay factor to continue in the future with regard to recording most of our projected proved tertiary reserves  although we expect our proved reserves to increase more rapidly in the future because of the projected size and magnitude of the potential reserves from projects either started or planned 
we allocated approximately million of the million adjusted purchase price of our march  seabreeze acquisition  million of our million january acquisition costs for tinsley  citronelle and south cypress creek fields  and virtually all of the second quarter million delhi acquisition costs to unevaluated properties to reflect the significant potential reserves associated with future tertiary floods that we considered to be part of these acquisitions 
as a result  these acquisitions did not materially impact our overall dd a rate  as the amount included in our full cost pool was a cost per boe relatively consistent with our overall dd a rate

the reduction in the estimated statutory rate to in was a result of our sale of our louisiana natural gas assets during the fourth quarter of for  our net effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to the recognition of enhanced oil recovery credits eor which lowered our overall tax expense 
for and  we did not earn any additional eor credits because of the high oil prices during and  which completely phased out our ability to earn any additional credits 
in all three periods  the current income tax expense represents our anticipated alternative minimum cash taxes that we cannot offset with eor credits 
as of december   we had an estimated million of eor credit carryforwards that we can utilize to reduce a portion of our cash taxes 
these eor credits do not begin to expire until since the ability to earn additional enhanced oil recovery credits is reduced or even eliminated based on the level of oil prices  we do not expect to earn any eor credits in the future unless oil prices decrease significantly from current levels 
once our existing eor credits are utilized  our cash taxes will also increase

historically  we hedged up to of our anticipated production each year to provide us with a reasonably certain amount of cash flow to cover most of our budgeted exploration and development expenditures without incurring significant debt 
since and beyond  we have entered into fewer derivative contracts  primarily because of our strong financial position resulting from our lower levels of debt relative to our cash flow from operations 
we did enter into natural gas derivative contracts in late and september as we believed that there is more risk with regard to natural gas prices and the fact that we planned to spend significantly more than our projected cash flow from operations during the ensuing year see capital resources and liquidity 
in late  we swapped to of our forecasted natural gas production at a weighted average price of per mcf  and in september we swapped to of our remaining forecasted natural gas production

since january   for accounting purposes  we have elected to account for our oil and natural gas derivative contracts as speculative contracts

at december   our derivative contracts were recorded at their fair value  which was a net liability of approximately million  a decrease of million from the million fair value asset recorded as of december  this change is primarily related to the recognition of our natural gas hedges which expired during  but were a significant asset at december  see above  and higher oil prices which reduced the value of the remaining oil swaps

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we select certain accounting policies and make certain estimates and judgments regarding the application of those policies 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the underlying assumptions and judgments by our management in their application  have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
following is a discussion of our most critical accounting estimates  judgments and uncertainties that are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements 
full cost method of accounting  depletion and depreciation and oil and natural gas reserves businesses involved in the production of oil and natural gas are required to follow accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
we apply the full cost method of accounting for our oil and natural gas properties 
another acceptable method of accounting for oil and gas production activities is the successful efforts method of accounting 
in general  the primary differences between the two methods are related to the capitalization 
table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of costs and the evaluation for asset impairment 
under the full cost method  all geological and geophysical costs  exploratory dry holes and delay rentals are capitalized to the full cost pool  whereas under the successful efforts method such costs are expensed as incurred 
in the assessment of impairment of oil and gas properties  the successful efforts method follows the guidance of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  under which the net book value of assets are measured for impairment against the undiscounted future cash flows using commodity prices consistent with management expectations 
under the full cost method  the full cost pool net book value of oil and gas properties is measured against future cash flows discounted at using commodity prices in effect at the end of the reporting period 
the financial results for a given period could be substantially different depending on the method of accounting that an oil and gas entity applies 
in our application of full cost accounting for our oil and gas producing activities  we make significant estimates at the end of each period related to accruals for oil and gas revenues  production  capitalized costs and operating expenses 
we calculate these estimates with our best available data  which includes  among other things  production reports  price posting  information compiled from daily drilling reports and other internal tracking devices  and analysis of historical results and trends 
while management is not aware of any required revisions to its estimates  there will likely be future adjustments resulting from such things as changes in ownership interests  payouts  joint venture audits  re allocations by the purchaser pipeline  or other corrections and adjustments common in the oil and natural gas industry  many of which will require retroactive application 
these types of adjustments cannot be currently estimated or determined and will be recorded in the period during which the adjustment occurs 
under full cost accounting  the estimated quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves used to compute depletion and the related present value of estimated future net cash flows therefrom used to perform the full cost ceiling test have a significant impact on the underlying financial statements 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible  including the hiring of independent engineers to prepare the report  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statement disclosures 
over the last four years  denbury s annual revisions to its reserve estimates have averaged approximately of the previous year s estimates and have been both positive and negative 
changes in commodity prices also affect our reserve quantities 
during  and  the change to reserve quantities related to commodity prices was relatively small  less than in prior years  as prices were relatively high each year end 
these changes in quantities affect our dd a rate  and the combined effect of changes in quantities and commodity prices impacts our full cost ceiling test calculation 
for example  we estimate that a increase in our estimate of proved reserves quantities would have lowered our fourth quarter dd a rate from per bbl to approximately per bbl  and a decrease in our proved reserve quantities would have increased our dd a rate to approximately per bbl 
also  reserve quantities and their ultimate values are the primary factors in determining the borrowing base under our bank credit facility and are determined solely by our banks 
there can also be significant questions as to whether reserves are sufficiently supported by technical evidence to be considered proven 
in some cases our proven reserves are less than what we believe to exist because additional evidence  including production testing  is required in order to classify the reserves as proven 
we have a corporate policy whereby we generally do not book proved undeveloped reserves unless the project has been committed to internally  which normally means it is scheduled within the subsequent three years or at least the commencement of the project is scheduled in the case of longer term multi year projects such as waterfloods and tertiary recovery projects 
therefore  with regard to potential reserves  there is uncertainty as to whether the reserves should be included as proven or not 
we also have a corporate policy whereby proved undeveloped reserves must be economic at long term historical prices  which are usually significantly less than the year end prices used in our reserve report 
this also can have the effect of eliminating certain projects being included in our estimates of proved reserves  which projects would otherwise be included if undeveloped reserves were determined to be economic solely based on current prices in a high price environment  as was the case during the last three year ends 
see depletion  depreciation and amortization under results of operations above for further discussion 
all of these factors and the decisions made regarding these issues can have a significant effect on our proven reserves

see also discussion of requirements to book proven tertiary oil reserves at results of operations depletion  depreciation and amortization 
tertiary injection cost our tertiary operations are conducted in reservoirs that have already produced significant amounts of oil over many years  however  in accordance with the rules for recording proved reserves  we cannot recognize proved reserves associated with enhanced recovery techniques  such as co injection  until there is a production response to the injected co or  unless the field is analogous to an existing flood 
our costs associated with the co we produce or acquire and inject are principally our costs of production  transportation and acquisition  or to pay royalties 
prior to january   we expensed currently all costs associated with injecting co that we use in our tertiary recovery operations  even though some of these costs were incurred prior to any tertiary related oil production 
commencing january   we will begin capitalizing  as a development cost  injection costs in fields that are in their development stage  which means we have not yet seen incremental oil production due to the co injections co a production response 
these capitalized development costs will be included in our unevaluated property costs within our full cost pool if there are not already proved tertiary reserves in that field 
after we see a production response to the co injections co the production stage  injection costs will be expensed as incurred and any previously deferred unevaluated development costs will become subject to depletion upon recognition of proved tertiary reserves 
based upon the current status of some of our tertiary floods  this change in accounting will cause us to capitalize certain costs that we historically expensed 
had the new method of accounting for tertiary injectant costs been used in periods prior to january   the effect on our financial statements would have been immaterial for all periods presented

requires that we estimate the future cost of this obligation  discount it to its present value  and record a corresponding asset and liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
the values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates  including the ultimate expected cost of the obligation  the expected future date of the required cash payment  and interest and inflation rates 
revisions to these estimates may be required based on changes to cost estimates  the timing of settlement  and changes in legal requirements 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis and an adjustment in our dd a expense in future periods 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding our asset retirement obligations 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes 
our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared  therefore  we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits and  prior to year end  net operating loss carryforwards 
adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns 
further  we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets primarily our enhanced oil recovery credits 
if recovery is not likely  we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover  which would result in an increase to our income tax expense 
as of december   we believe that all of our deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet will ultimately be recovered 
if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not probable 
a increase in our effective tax rate would have increased our calculated income tax expense by approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information concerning our income taxes 

table of contents denbury resources inc management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations oil and natural gas derivative contracts we enter into oil and natural gas derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk associated with future oil and natural gas production 
these contracts have historically consisted of options  in the form of price floors or collars  and fixed price swaps 
under sfas no 
 every derivative instrument is required to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
if the derivative does not qualify as a hedge or is not designated as a hedge  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized currently in earnings 
if the derivative qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting  the change in fair value of the derivative is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income equity to the extent that the hedge is effective  and in the income statement to the extent it is ineffective 
as of january   we abandoned hedge accounting 
this means that any changes in the future fair value of these derivative contracts will be charged to earnings on a quarterly basis instead of charging the effective portion to other comprehensive income and the balance to earnings 
while we may experience more volatility in our net income than if we had continued to apply hedge accounting treatment as permitted by sfas no 
 we believe that for us the benefits associated with applying hedge accounting do not outweigh the cost  time and effort to comply with hedge accounting 
during  and  we recognized expense income of million  million and million  respectively  related to changes in the fair market value of our derivative contracts 
stock compensation plans effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment using the modified prospective application method described in the statement 
among other items  sfas no 
r eliminates the use of apb and the intrinsic value method of accounting  and requires companies to recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments  based on the grant date fair value of those awards  in the financial statements 
under the modified prospective application method  effective january   we began to recognize compensation expense for the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of december   over the remaining service periods  and for new awards granted or modified after january  we estimate the fair value of stock option or stock appreciation right sar awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of somewhat subjective assumptions  including expected stock price volatility and expected term 
other assumptions required for estimating fair value with the black scholes model are the expected risk free interest rate and expected dividend yield of the company s stock 
the risk free interest rates used are the us treasury yield for bonds matching the expected term of the option on the date of grant 
our dividend yield is zero  as denbury does not pay a dividend 
we utilize historical experience in arriving at our assumptions for volatility and expected term inputs 
we recognize the stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
the expense we recognize is net of estimated forfeitures 
we estimate our forfeiture rate based on prior experience and true it up for actual results as the awards vest 
as of december   there was million of total compensation cost to be recognized in future periods related to non vested stock options and sars 
the cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make other estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during each reporting period 
we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable and reliable  and believe that the ultimate actual results will not differ significantly from those reported  however  such estimates and assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  and such risks and uncertainties could cause the actual results to differ materially from our estimates
