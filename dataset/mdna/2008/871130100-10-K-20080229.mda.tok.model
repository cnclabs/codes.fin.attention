item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a includes the following sections executive overview that discusses at a high level our operating results and some of the trends that affect our business 
critical accounting policies that we believe are important to understanding the assumptions and judgments underlying our financial statements 
results of operations that begins with an overview followed by a more detailed discussion of our revenue and expenses 
liquidity and capital resources which discusses key aspects of our statements of cash flows  changes in our balance sheets and our financial commitments 
you should note that this md a discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
please see the section entitled risk factors  future operating results at the beginning of item a for important information to consider when evaluating such statements 
you should read this md a in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes in part ii  item we adopted statement of financial accounting sfas r  share based payment  on january  using the modified prospective transition method 
operating income for and included increases in pre tax share based compensation expense for stock options and stock appreciation rights that we recorded as a result of adopting sfas r million and million  respectively 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated to include share based compensation for options and stock appreciation rights 
for a further discussion of sfas r  see note seven to the consolidated financial statements stockholders equity  part ii  item on november  we acquired mobile  inc which we renamed sybase  inc for approximately million 
sybase delivers mobile data and messaging  premium content  and value added services for leading mobile operators  content providers  global brands  media companies  and financial institutions worldwide 
total revenues and operating income of sybase were million and million  respectively for the year ended december  total revenues and operating loss of mobile for period from november  through december   were million and million  respectively 

table of contents executive overview our business sybase is a global enterprise software and services company exclusively focused on managing and mobilizing information from the data center to the point of action 
we provide open  cross platform solutions that securely deliver information anytime  anywhere  enabling customers to create an information edge 
our value proposition involves enabling the unwired enterprise through integrated applications  solutions designed to manage information across the enterprise  allowing customers to extract more value from their information technology it investments 
we deliver a full range of solutions to ensure that customer information is securely managed and mobilized to the point of action  including enterprise and mobile databases  middleware  synchronization  encryption and device management software  and mobile messaging services 
during the fourth quarter of we expanded our reach by acquiring mobile  a privately held global provider of mobile messaging services and premium content delivery and value added services 
mobile extends our unwired enterprise strategy with the addition of two new enterprise channels leading mobile operators and content providers and an extensive  operator grade network with connections to approximately mobile operators around the world 
through mobile s global footprint  sybase enables enterprises to deliver data and applications to over of the world s mobile subscriber population 
mobile operates as a separate business unit  renamed sybase our business is organized into three business segments ipg  which principally focuses on enterprise class database servers  integration and development products  ias  which provides mobile database and mobile enterprise solutions  and sybase  which provides global services for mobile messaging interoperability and the management and distribution of mobile content 
for further discussion of our business segments  see consolidated financial statements  note ten segment and geographical information  part ii  item our results we recorded all time highs in revenue  operating income and net income for the three month and full year period ended december  total revenues were  million for  compared to million for  and million for the increase in total revenues from to was primarily due to the full year operations of sybase which added an incremental million in messaging revenue to the yearly results  along with an increase of million percent in ipg revenues and an increase of million percent in ias revenues 
the increase in ias revenues from to was primarily driven by a percent increase in license revenue and a percent increase in service revenue 
the growth in ias license revenues was primarily attributed to a percent increase in license revenues from our mobile and embedded database product  while the increase in service revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in technical support services revenue 
going forward  we believe our ias revenues will be aided by momentum from our unwired enterprise initiative 
the increase in ipg revenues from to was primarily attributable to a percent increase in license revenues and a percent increase in service revenues 
the overall increase in ipg license revenue was attributable to a percent increase in database license revenues which is largely fueled by the momentum from our iq analytics server 
we reported net income of million for  compared to net income of million for  and million in our operating income was million percent operating margin 
table of contents compared to million percent operating margin in the increase in operating income was attributable to a million increase in revenues partially offset by a million increase in expenses 
the overall increase in operating expenses was attributable to an increase of million associated with the full year operation of the sybase business which was acquired in the fourth quarter of our overall financial position is strong 
during we generated net cash from operating activities of million  and had million in cash  cash equivalents and cash investments at december  our net cash flows from operations were the highest yearly amount in our history 
our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days for the quarter ended december  compared to days for the quarter ended december  for a discussion of certain factors that may impact our business and financial results  see risk factors future operating results  above 
business trends overall  the it spending patterns we are witnessing support our view that fiscally cautious customers generally are continuing to purchase products and services based on present needs as opposed to fulfilling anticipated future needs 
we also see some indications that it budgets may be constricted for certain companies in the financial services industry where we have a significant market share and presence 
we have not noted a change in buying patterns to date for these customers and remain cautiously optimistic that our business with this sector will not be materially impacted 
notwithstanding the above we continue to see a proliferation of enterprise data and greater customer willingness to invest resources on new data integration initiatives and analytic solutions 
these solutions contributed to a year over year increases of percent in license revenue from these products during compared to our replication server product delivers operational data across complex and broadly distributed heterogeneous data infrastructures in near real time to ensure continuous data availability  operational synchronization and timely reporting 
our iq product offers a highly optimized analytic engine specifically designed to deliver dramatically faster results for business intelligence  analytic and reporting solutions 
the overall environment for new sales of enterprise infrastructure software primarily sold by our ipg segment is limited by a maturing enterprise infrastructure software market which moderates the overall growth potential for this segment 
we continue to maintain  however  a strong pipeline for enterprise infrastructure products especially continued high demand for our adaptive server enterprise ase during we added over new ase customers 
with respect to the market for mobility and integration products primarily sold by our ias segment  we believe these products are gaining market acceptance and will provide us with growth opportunities in the future 
we believe that in we are supported by a strong product cycle with our refreshed ianywhere product platform that will continue to drive growth in the ias segment 
we also see a growing pipeline associated with extending enterprise level data to handheld devices which we believe supports and validates our unwired enterprise initiative 
with respect to the market for messaging services sold by our sybase segment  we believe that our inter carrier messaging business will see revenue growth driven by continuing growth in short messaging services sms and multimedia messaging services mms traffic levels and the acquisition of new carriers  especially in new territories 
we also believe that enterprises  brands and content providers will focus more of their business towards mobile messaging as an inexpensive means of interacting with their customers on a real time basis 
this in turn will drive further growth in the application messaging industry 
to handle this demand  we plan to expand our data center capacity and disaster recovery capabilities  add connectors from our new customers to our network and develop new services 

table of contents moving forward we will continue to manage our operating margin  pursue synergies between our software and messaging businesses  and aggressively pursue our unwired enterprise initiative 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we also are required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to software and mobile messaging revenue recognition  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  valuation of investments without readily available markets and the classification of related impairments  the allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software  income taxes  stock based compensation  purchase accounting  restructuring  and contingencies and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances 
our management has reviewed the development  selection  and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
further  changes in accounting and legal standards could adversely affect our future operating results see risk factors future operating results  above 
our critical accounting policies include software and mobile messaging revenue recognition  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  valuation of investments without readily available markets and classification of related impairments  allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software  income taxes  stock based compensation  purchase accounting  restructuring and contingencies and liabilities  each of which are discussed below 
revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software and message services companies are very complex 
we follow specific and detailed guidance in measuring revenue  although certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
these judgments would include  for example  the determination of a customer s creditworthiness  whether two separate transactions with a customer should be accounted for as a single transaction  reporting certain third party content delivery revenues gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or whether included software services are essential to the functionality of a product 

table of contents license and service revenues we recognize software revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  and in certain instances in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts or sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
we license software under non cancelable license agreements 
license fee revenues are recognized when a a non cancelable license agreement is in force  b the product has been delivered  c the license fee is fixed or determinable  and d collection is reasonably assured 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
residual method accounting 
in software arrangements that include multiple elements eg  license rights and technical support services  we allocate the total fees among each of the elements using the residual method of accounting 
under this method  revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements  and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for such undelivered elements is based upon the price we charge for such product or service when it is sold separately 
we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes to our vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for such undelivered elements 
as a result  the timing of revenue recognition associated with multiple element arrangements could differ significantly from our historical results 
percentage of completion accounting 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment of the licenses  provided i the criteria described in subparagraphs a through d above are met  ii payment of the license fee is not dependent upon performance of the consulting services  and iii the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software 
if the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or performance of services is a condition to payment of license fees  both the software license and consulting fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we use labor hours to estimate the progress to completion 
under this method  we are required to estimate the number of total hours needed to complete a project  and revenues are recognized based on the percentage of total contract hours as they are completed while costs are recognized as incurred 
due to the complexity involved in the estimating process  revenues and profits recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting are subject to revision as contract phases are actually completed 
historically  these revisions have not been material 
sublicense revenues 
we recognize sublicense fees as reported to us by our licensees 
license fees for certain application development and data access tools are recognized upon direct shipment by us to the end user or upon direct shipment to the reseller for resale to the end user 
if collection is not reasonably assured in advance  revenue is recognized only when sublicense fees are actually collected and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
service revenues 
technical support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the related support agreement  which in most cases is one year 
revenues from consulting services under time and materials contracts  and for education  are recognized as services are performed 
revenues from fixed price consulting agreements are generally recognized based on the proportional performance of the project  with performance measured based on hours of work performed 
message revenues we recognize message revenue in accordance with sab no 
 emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf and where applicable in accordance with eitf  no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
we recognize revenue when a there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  b the service has been provided to the customer  c the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed and determinable  and d the collection of the fees is reasonable assured 

table of contents our agreements with mobile operators and application providers to provide messaging data delivery and settlement services generally have an initial term of one year 
we generate a significant portion of our message revenue from per message transaction fees and to a lesser extent  from revenue share agreements related to the delivery of third party content 
we recognize revenue from transaction fees based upon the number of messages successfully processed by our platforms and delivered in accordance with the terms of our arrangements 
in some instances third party content providers  and other enterprises enter into revenue sharing arrangements with us 
under a standard revenue sharing transaction we deliver content from a third party provider to the cell phone of a mobile operatior s subscriber 
third party content includes  among other  ringtones  wallpapers  interactive games  competitions  directory inquiry services  and information services 
the subscriber is invoiced by their mobile operator  who upon receipt of payment  remits a portion of the charge to us 
upon payment from the mobile operator  we remit payment to the third party content provider 
in accordance with eitf  we have determined that we act as an agent under these revenue sharing arrangements and accordingly  record as revenue the net amount retained by us 
the net amount retained by us reflects the gross amount billed to the operator less amounts due to the content provider 
impairment of goodwill  non amortizable intangible assets and other purchased intangible assets goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets  such as tradenames  have generally resulted from our business combinations accounted for as purchases 
we are required to test amounts recorded as goodwill or other non amortizable intangible assets with indeterminate lives  at least annually for impairment 
the review of goodwill and indeterminate lived intangibles for potential impairment is highly subjective and requires us to make numerous estimates  using a discounted cash flow model  to determine the fair values of our reporting units to which goodwill is assigned 
for these purposes  our reporting units equate to our reported segments 
see note ten to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value  we are required to perform an analysis similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business in order to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
this analysis requires a valuation of certain other purchased intangible assets with determinate and indeterminate useful lives including in process research and development  and developed technology 
we performed our annual impairment analysis for each of our historical operating units ipg  ias  and sy and for each indeterminate lived intangible asset as of december  this analysis indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit or indeterminate lived intangible exceeded its carrying value 
therefore  we were not required to recognize an impairment loss in as of december   our goodwill balance totaled million and our other purchased intangibles totaled million 
changes in our internal business structure  increases in the applicable discount rate  changes in our future revenue and expense forecasts  and certain other factors that directly impact the valuation of our reporting units could result in a future impairment charge 
we also continue to separately review our other intangible assets eg  purchased technology  customer lists and covenants not to compete for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
for these purposes  recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing their carrying values to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
this methodology requires us to estimate future cash flows associated with certain assets or groups of assets 
changes in these estimates  technology obsolescence  customer terminations including message customers due to technology interoperability and other factors could result in impairment losses associated with other intangible assets 
there were no indicators of impairment during 
table of contents valuation of investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  sfas management determines the appropriate classification of debt and equity securities at the time of purchase and re evaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date 
at december   we have classified all debt and equity securities as available for sale pursuant to sfas such securities are recorded at fair value and unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related tax effect  if any  are not reflected in earnings but are reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income loss until realized 
realized gains and losses are determined on the specific identification method and are reflected in income 
on january  we adopted the fasb staff positions fas nos 
and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments the fsps 
the fsps were issued on november  and nullified certain provisions of eitf no 
related to evaluating an other than temporary impairment and clarified the accounting policies set forth in fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
during  we did not recognize impairment losses related to unrealized losses on debt securities as a charge to income as we believed that the decline in market value was due to changes in interest rates and not due to increased credit risk and we had the ability and intent to hold the securities until a recovery of fair value  which may be maturity 
as of december   long term cash investments totaling million include six auction rate securities ars with an aggregate par value of million 
as of december   the temporary impairment associated with three of these ars representing an aggregate par value of million and the other than temporary impairment associated with the remaining three ars representing an aggregate par value of million were not material 
our ars are floating rate securities with longer term maturities which are marketed by financial institutions with auction reset dates at day intervals to provide short term liquidity 
the underlying collateral of the ars held by us consist primarily of commercial paper  debt instruments issued by governmental agencies and governmental sponsored entities  and similar assets 
certain of the ars may have limited direct or indirect investments in mortgage or mortgage related securities 
the credit ratings for five of the ars were aaa and for one of the ars was aa at the time of purchase 
beginning in august and into september  each of the ars auctions began to fail due to a lack of market for these securities 
the failed auctions have resulted in higher interest rates being earned on these investments  but the investments currently lack short term liquidity 
we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction for the ars investments is successful or until we sell the securities in a secondary market which currently does not exist 
based on our cash  cash equivalents and cash investment balances of million and expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity for the ars to adversely affect our ability to conduct business and believe we have the ability and intent to hold the temporarily impaired securities through the currently estimated recovery period 
the fair values of the ars as of december  are based on an estimation using a discounted cash flow model for each of the six ars using credit related discount rates and term to recovery as key inputs 
the determination if the security is other then temporarily impaired is based on a variety of factors including i the quality of the investments held by the trust issuer  ii the financial condition of the credit rating of the trust  issuer  sponsors  and insurers  and  iii the frequency of the auction function failing 
changes in assumptions and other factors could result in additional realized and unrealized impairment losses 
these securities are being analyzed each reporting period for changes in estimated fair values and temporary and other than temporary impairment factors 
we expect additional impairment amounts may be recorded in future periods 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected non collection of accounts receivable 
in determining the amount of the allowance we consider our historical level of credit losses  judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers  an assessment current economic and industry trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future  and other factors 
our allowances have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that our allowance will continue to be adequate 
for example  our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million at december  if our allowance for doubtful accounts  including identified specific customer matters  changed by our allowance for doubtful accounts and operating results would change by million 
capitalized software we capitalize certain software development costs after a product becomes technologically feasible and before its general release to customers 
our net capitalized software totaled million at december  significant judgment is required in determining when a product becomes technologically feasible 
capitalized development costs are then amortized over the product s estimated life beginning upon general release of the product 
quarterly  we compare a product s unamortized capitalized cost to the product s net realizable value 
to the extent unamortized capitalized cost exceeds net realizable value based on the product s estimated future gross revenues reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and selling the product the excess is written off 
this analysis requires us to estimate future gross revenues associated with certain products and the future costs of completing and selling certain products 
changes in these estimates could result in write offs of capitalized software costs 
see note one to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
income taxes estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes and valuation allowance we use the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes 
this methodology recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we then record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that likely will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we determine in any period that we could realize a larger net deferred tax asset than the recorded amount  we would adjust the deferred tax asset and record a corresponding reduction to our income tax expense for the period 
for example  during the quarter ending december  management reduced its estimate of foreign subsidiaries earnings permanently reinvested 
as a result of this change and other projected changes in the company s future us taxable income  management re evaluated the need for valuation allowances for the company s us deferred tax assets 
as a result of this re evaluation  during the quarter ending december   the company released approximately million of valuation allowances relating to federal research tax credit and foreign tax credit carryforwards  of which million reduced tax expense and approximately million reduced goodwill 
conversely  if we determine that we would be unable to realize a portion of our recorded deferred tax asset  we would adjust the deferred tax asset and record a charge to income tax expense for the period 
significant judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations between the actual outcomes of these future tax consequences eg  the income we earn within the united states could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
see note eight to the consolidated financial statements income taxes  part ii  item our effective tax rate is based on expected geographic income  statutory rates and enacted tax rules  including transfer pricing 
we are required to exercise significant judgment in determining our effective rate and in evaluating various positions that apply to our worldwide operations 
we believe that our tax positions  including intercompany transfer pricing policies  are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
it is possible  however  that these positions will be challenged which may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 

table of contents on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin no 
fin prescribes a recognition and measurement threshold for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position 
accounting for stock based compensation plans prior to january   we accounted for our stock based employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly we were not required to record compensation expense when stock options were granted to eligible participants as long as the exercise price was not less than the fair market value of the stock when the option was granted 
prior to january   we generally recorded stock based employee compensation relating to restricted stock grants 
we recorded no compensation expense in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as the purchase price of the stock was not less than of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period 
in accordance with sfas and sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we disclosed our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if we had applied the fair value based method in measuring compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes a period compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  and b period compensation expense for all stock based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost before income tax benefit related to non vested stock based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of years 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions shown in note seven to the consolidated financial statements stockholders equity  part ii  item we estimated the expected term of options granted based on historical exercise patterns 
beginning in the second quarter of we estimated the volatility of our options and stock appreciation rights considering both the historical volatility of our stock over the average expected life of our options and the prices of publicly traded options  consistent with sfas r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
prior to that  we estimated the volatility factors for stock options and stock appreciation rights considering the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent four year period which was approximately equal to the average expected life of our options 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on the average of the and year treasury rates as published by the federal reserve 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
sfas r requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and 
table of contents record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for purposes of calculating pro forma information under sfas for periods prior to  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
we amortize the fair value on a ratable basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates determined under the black scholes option valuation model 
in the future  changes in the assumptions under the black scholes valuation model or our election to use a different valuation model  could result in a significantly different impact on our net income or loss 
purchase accounting we have made estimates of the fair values of purchased intangible and other assets acquired in conjunction with our purchase of mobile  inc as of november   and other acquired companies based primarily on appraisals from third parties and certain internally generated information 
purchased intangible assets  excluding goodwill  totaled million at december  if the subsequent actual and updated projections of the underlying business activity are less as compared to the underlying assumptions and projections used to develop these values  then we could experience impairment losses  as described above 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain of these assets and these lives were used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  then additional depreciation or amortization expense could be incurred on an annual basis 
historically  we have not made any changes in these areas 
if the estimates of the economic lives of the definite lived intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisition of mobile were reduced by one year  our amortization expense would increase by approximately million 
restructuring historically  we have recorded significant accruals in connection with various restructuring activities 
our remaining restructuring accruals primarily relate to the estimated net costs to settle certain lease obligations based on analysis of independent real estate consultants 
while we do not anticipate significant changes to these estimates in the future  the actual costs may differ from estimates 
for example  if we are able to negotiate more affordable termination fees  if rental rates increase in the markets where the properties are located  or if we are able to locate suitable sublease tenants more quickly than expected  the actual costs could be lower than our estimates 
in that case  we would reduce our restructuring accrual with a corresponding credit to cost of restructuring or goodwill 
alternatively  if we are unable to negotiate affordable termination fees  if rental rates decrease in the markets where the properties are located  or if it takes us longer than expected to find suitable sublease tenants  the actual costs could exceed our estimates see note thirteen to consolidated financial statements restructuring costs  part ii  item 
table of contents contingencies and liabilities we are involved from time to time in various proceedings  lawsuits and claims involving our customers  products  intellectual property  stockholders and employees  among other parties 
we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
when we reasonably determine that a loss associated with any of these matters is probable  and can reasonably estimate the loss  we record a reserve to provide for such loss contingencies 
if we are unable to record a reserve because we are not able to estimate the amount of a potential loss in a matter  or if we determine that a loss is not probable  we are nevertheless required to disclose certain information regarding such matter if we determine that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
because of the inherent uncertainties related to these types of matters  we base our loss reserves on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we may reevaluate our assessment regarding the probability of a matter or its expected loss 
our financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by such revisions in our estimates 
for further discussion of contingencies and liabilities  see risk factors future operating results  above 
we currently believe that the ultimate liability  if any  for any pending claims of any type either alone or combined will not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we also believe that we would be able to obtain any necessary licenses or other rights to disputed intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms 
however  the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and  regardless of outcome  litigation can have an adverse impact on sybase because of defense costs  negative publicity  diversion of management resources and other factors 
our inability to obtain necessary license or other legal rights  or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business

segment license and service revenues include transactions between ias and ipg  the most common instance relates to the sale of ias products and services to third parties by ipg 
in the case of such a transaction  ipg records the revenue on the sale with a corresponding inter company expense on the transaction 
ias then records intercompany revenue and continues to bear the costs of providing the product or service

as of december   the temporary impairment associated with three of these ars representing an aggregate par value of million and the other than temporary impairment associated with the remaining three ars representing an aggregate par value of million were not material 
our ars are floating rate securities with longer term maturities which are marketed by financial institutions with auction reset dates at day intervals to provide short term liquidity 
the underlying collateral of the ars held by us consist primarily of commercial paper  debt instruments issued by governmental agencies and governmental sponsored entities  and similar assets 
certain of the ars may have limited direct or indirect investments in mortgage or mortgage related securities 
the credit ratings for five of the ars were aaa and for one of the ars was aa at the time of purchase 
beginning in august and into september  each of the ars auctions began to fail due to a lack of market for these securities 
the failed auctions have resulted in higher interest rates being earned on these investments  but the investments currently lack short term liquidity 
we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction for the ars investments is successful or until we sell the securities in a secondary market which currently does not exist 
based on our cash  cash equivalents and cash investment balances of million and expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate that the lack of liquidity for the ars to adversely affect our ability to conduct business and believe we have the ability and intent to hold the temporarily impaired securities through the currently estimated recovery period 
the fair values of the ars as of december  are based on an estimation using a discounted cash flow model for each of the six ars using credit related discount rates and term to recovery as key inputs 
historically  given the liquidity created by the auctions  ars were presented as current assets under marketable securities on the company s balance sheet 
given the failed auctions  the ars are illiquid until there is a successful auction for them or a secondary market develops 
accordingly  the entire ars related balance has been reclassified from current to non current assets 
if uncertainties in the credit and capital markets continue  these markets deteriorate further or the debt insurers experience additional ratings downgrades we may incur additional unrealized losses in or impairments to realized losses in our investment portfolio  which could negatively affect our reported earnings 
we expect that additional impairments may be recorded in future periods

this interest rate level was up approximately percent from for if interest rates fell by a similar amount percent in  our interest income would decline approximately million assuming consistent investment levels 
the table below presents the cash  cash equivalents and cash investments and the related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio at december  the cash  cash equivalents and cash investments balances approximate fair value at december  amortized weighted average dollars in thousands principal amount interest rate cash and cash equivalents cash investments total cash  cash equivalents and cash investments default risk we place our investments with high quality credit issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe  high investment grade securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity  with the exception of failed auction securities described elsewhere 
we have no cash flow exposure due to rate changes for our investment portfolio  since all investments are made in securities with fixed interest rates 
failed auction securities a small proportion of our investment portfolio is held in auction rate securities with credit ratings ranging from aa to aaa at the time of purchase 
ars are floating rate securities with long term nominal maturities of to years which are marketed by financial institutions with auction reset dates at day intervals to provide short term liquidity 
the underlying collateral of the ars held by us consist primarily of commercial paper  debt instruments issued by governmental agencies and governmental sponsored entities  and similar assets 
certain of the ars may have limited direct or indirect investments in mortgage or mortgage related securities 
beginning in august and september each of the ars auctions related to our investments began to fail 
at december  we held approximately million in ars at cost for which the reset auctions have failed 
the failed auctions have resulted in higher interest rates being earned on these investments  but the investments currently lack short term liquidity 
we will not be able to access these funds until a future auction for the ars investments is successful or we sell the securities in a secondary market 
therefore  we have moved the balance sheet classification of these investments from short term to long term 
any future evaluations by the credit agencies could result in downgrades to the credit ratings of the ars we hold 
based on our current cash  
table of contents investment balances and expected operating cash flows  we do not anticipate that the lack of short term liquidity for the ars to adversely affect our ability to conduct business 
see note two to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item interest expense rate risk borrowings  which were at fixed rates  as of december  were million 
interest expense was million for based on effective interest rates at december   a basis point increase in interest rates of our borrowings subject to variable interest rate fluctuations would increase our interest expense by million annually
